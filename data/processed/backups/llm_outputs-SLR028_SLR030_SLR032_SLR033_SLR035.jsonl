De jure judicial independence is taken from the CCP"},{"variable":"Data_Analysis_1","code":2,"label":"Quantitative (statistical modelling, regression analysis)","evidence":"We fitted a series of multilevel logistic regression models. Our dataset contains observations from 21 European states. To determine how much of the overall variance in trust in the judiciary is explained by differences at the individual (level 1) or country level (level 2), we specified an empty random intercept model"},{"variable":"Key_Finding_1","code":1,"label":"Winner-loser gap exists in judicial confidence","evidence":"We demonstrate that though the judiciary – more than any other institution – should inspire equal confidence in citizens, a winner-loser gap in trust in the judicial branch does exist. Yet, the effect of winning or losing an election is not as consequential for trust in the judiciary as it is for trust in government and parliament"},{"variable":"Key_Finding_2","code":1,"label":"Populist supporters show more extreme winner-loser gaps","evidence":"The winner-loser gap is larger for supporters of populist parties than for those supporting mainstream parties. Supporters of winning populist parties experience a stronger boost in institutional trust than supporters of mainstream parties. Nonetheless, levels of confidence in the judiciary are not higher among 'populist winners' than among 'non-populist losers'"},{"variable":"Key_Finding_3","code":1,"label":"De facto judicial independence moderates winner-loser gap","evidence":"De facto judicial independence has a strong substantial effect on public confidence in the justice system. The results indicate an interaction between de facto judicial independence and winner/loser status. The negative sign of the coefficient for the interaction term indicates that the positive effect of being a political winner on trust in the judiciary is weakened with higher levels of judicial independence"}]}
