Public Trust in Parliament – A Comparative Study1

Summary

The study deals with public trust in parliament, and is based on the responses of the

Secretaries General of 21 parliaments to a questionnaire we sent to them, on public opinion

surveys prepared in various states around the world and by bodies that engage in comparative

international public opinion surveys, and on wide scale professional literature.

We found that there is a worldwide problem of low levels of trust in government

institutions in general and in parliaments in particular. In this study we concentrated on the

phenomenon in the Western democracies, to which Israel belongs, and most of the

information presented relates to them. The study presents and analyzes the data, and then

reviews the extensive professional literature on the subject.

The relevant professional literature deals with the term “trust” in various spheres in the

Social Sciences; with explanations on the state and international levels of the phenomenon of

low levels of trust in government institutions in general and parliaments in particular; with the

degree to which the phenomenon threatens democracy; and with reforms that can be

introduced in order to bring about a change in the trend.

Many parliaments have introduced reforms that are designed to improve the connection

between themselves and the public, and there is an expectation that the reforms – in the

sphere of information, education and communications – will have an effect, at least indirectly,

on the level of trust in them. In fact, the reforms have had little effect on public trust, because

the low level of trust apparently results more from social and cultural developments than from

objective reasons, connected with the functioning of the parliaments or their reflection in the

media.

Despite the non-complimentary results of the Knesset Index of 2001 regarding public

opinion towards the Knesset, it is apparent that compared to the 15 members of the EU before

the enlargement, the situation in Israel is not as bad as it might seem.

1. Introduction

In 2001 the Knesset Research and Information Center2 published a research report regarding

the public’s perception of the legislative authority (hereinafter: the Knesset Index), which was

1 I should like to thank the former Director of the Knesset Research and Information Center, Dr. Jacob Warshavsky, and the current Director of the Information and Research Department for their comments and illuminations. I bear full responsibility for everything written in this document. 2 The RIC has recently changed its name to the Knesset Information and Research Department.

prepared in cooperation with Professor Ephraim Ya’ar-Yuchtman and the “Dahaf” Institute,

directed by Dr. Mina Zemah. The study examined public opinion in depth and detail, and

several grave conclusions emerged from it concerning public opinion in Israel regarding the

Knesset and its Members, and the levels of public trust in them. Inter alia it was found that

only 14% of those interviewed had much or full trust in the Knesset.3

As a result of the findings of the Knesset Index the Secretary General of the Knesset, Mr.

Arie Hahn, asked that we check with the Secretaries General of other parliaments whether

their parliaments had ordered the preparation of public opinion surveys similar to the Knesset

Index, whether they too suffer from low public trust, and if they do – how their respective

parliaments contend with the problem. A questionnaire was sent to 30 Secretaries General of

Parliaments; 21 replies were received.4

After we received the replies we decided to collect independently additional information

from the following sources: the websites of parliaments that have introduced, or are planning

reforms to improve their image and connection with the public; national and international

public opinion surveys that deal, inter alia, with public opinion in government institutions;

professional literature that deals with various aspects of trust in general and trust in

government institutions in particular.

2. The Decline in Public Trust in Government Institutions in General, and in Parliament in Particular. There are many sources for comparative data regarding the level of public trust in government

institutions, including parliament. We found such data in the websites of national public

opinion institutes, and of international bodies that conduct comparative opinion polls. Among

the latter mention should be made of the Eurbarometer;5 the surveys conducted in four

regions – Africa, East Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe – which are associated in a

body called “The Global Barometer Surveys”;6 the World Value Survey of which the

See details regarding the responses received in the list of sources. 5 The Eurobarometer was founded in 1973. It publishes regularly opinion surveys performed in the member states of the EU, and in candidates for membership. It is run by the Public Opinion Analysis Section of the European Commission. The surveys deal with various issues that are connected to the essence and activity of the EU, including public opinion regarding government institutions and international organizations. The central publication of the Eurobarometer is the Standard Eurobarometer, which is published twice a year. http://europa.eu.int/comm/public_opinion/index_en.htm (15/2/06).

called “The Global Barometer Surveys”;6 the World Value Survey of which the European

Value Study is a subdivision;7 and the European Social Survey.8

We found that several international organizations have been dealing in recent years with

the decline in public trust in government institutions, and its ramifications. In a report

prepared in 2001 for the OECD it was found that many states, which are members of the

Organization have started to focus attention on strengthening relations with their citizens as a

result of the decline in the rates of participation in the elections, in the rates of membership in

political parties, and in the trust that the public expresses in central public institutions,

including parliaments.9

2.1. Public Trust in Government Institutions

We mention public trust in government institutions in general, and public trust in parliament

in a single breath, as if they constitute a single phenomenon. And indeed, in public opinion

surveys in which the interviewees are asked about their trust in parliament they are also asked

about other government and public institutions. The Eurobarometer surveys ask about a

variety of national and international institutions. The survey held in the Spring of 2005

6 The bodies operating within the framework of the Global Barometer Surveys are the following: The Afrobarometer, which is run by a group of research institutes in the United States, South Africa and Ghana, and published its first survey in 2001. The Afrobarometer carries out surveys in the following countries: Benin, Botswana, Cape Verde, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. (http://www.afrobarometer.org, 4/4/06) The East Asia Barometer, which started to operate in 2001. It is run by academics from East Asia and the U.S., and is coordinated by Professor Yun-han Chu from the National Taiwan University. The countries covered by the survey are: China, Hong-Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Mongolia, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. (http://www.eastasiabarometer.org 4/4/06) The Latinobarómetro, which engages in public opinion surveys in Latin America. It was initiated by the MORI Institute in 1995. Today it is run in Chile by Ms. Martha Lagos. The countries covered by the survey are: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El-Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay. (http://www.latinobarometro.org, 15/2/06). Surveys that are held in Russia (since 1992), the Baltic States (since 1993) and the new states in Eastern Europe (since 1991), which are conducted by the Centre for Studies in Public Policy at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, under Prof. Richard Rose. (http://www.cspp.abdn.ac.uk, 4/4/06). 7 The World Value Survey Organization is an international academic research body centered in Sweden, which collects statistical data around the world regarding the values and beliefs of the public, including the political sphere, since the early 1980s. (http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org, 15/2/06). The European Value Study is part of the World Value Survey, and concentrates on Europe. http://www.europeanvalues.nl/index3.htm,(15/2/06). 8 The European Social Survey is an academic body, which receives its funding from the European Commission, the European Fund for Science, and the participating states. Israel participated in the first survey of the ESS that was held in 2002 by means of Prof. Noah Levin-Epstein from the Department of Sociology at Tel Aviv University. http://naticent02.uuhost.uk.uu.net/ (15/2/06). 9 OECD (2001). The OECD continues to deal with the issue, and on November 28, 2005 a Ministerial Conference was convened under its auspices in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. http://www.oecd.org/document/5/0,2340,en_33873108_33873626_35760965_1_1_1_1,00.html (15/2/06).

In most of the European states it was found that trust in the legal system is the highest among

the four institutions. In all the states trust in parties in the lowest. As to trust in government

versus trust in parliament, in some of the states trust in government is greater, and in some in parliament. In 12 of the 15 members of the EU before the enlargement trust in parliament

was higher than trust in government (the exceptions were Luxemburg, Spain and Finland). In

most of the new members or candidates for entry trust in government is higher. In Israel,

9

according to the Knesset Index, and according to the Peace Index,10 trust in government is

higher than trust in the Knesset.

Within the framework of a project on parliaments and democracy being prepared by Prof.

David Beetham for the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the following graph was prepared, that

compares the average figures in various regions regarding trust in parliament, in parties (or in

some cases in the ruling party), in the legal system, in the police and in the army.11 Once

again it transpires that trust in parties is the lowest in all the regions, except for Africa. In all

the regions trust in parliament in lower than trust in the legal system, in the police and in the

army.

Is there a correlation between the level of trust that the public expresses in various

institutions? When we are speaking of parliament and government the answer is positive: in

all the countries for which we found data, public trust in parliament and government increases

and decreases in parallel (though not necessarily at the same rate). The explanation is that in

In the survey fixed and changing questions are asked regarding the public’s position on the peace process, and from time to time questions are also asked on current political issues, and on public trust in government institutions. 11 Our thanks to Prof. David Beetham for sending us the graph.

parliamentary democracies the public does not always distinguish between the two, and the

distribution of functions between them is not clear.12 As to the legal system, the correlation is

less clear.

2.2. Public Trust in Parliament

From the information we gathered from numerous and varied sources it emerges that a

decline has taken place – though not a constant one – in public trust in parliaments in most of

the states in the last decade.13

From the Eurobarometer data regarding the 15 states that were members of the EU before

the enlargement, it emerges that the average rate of those expressing trust in their parliaments

declined from 49% in 1996 to 39% in 2005, even though in several states trust increased or

remained stable.

Table No. 3 presents data regarding the average annual change in public trust in national

parliaments on the basis of various public opinion surveys. The table points to a decline in

public trust in parliaments in most of the states surveyed.

These data present averages, and it is possible that there was a sharp decline in a certain

period, and after that the situation stabilized, or an increase took place, which is not reflected

in the data.

We checked this in the Survey of the Harris Polls in the U.S. (see the bottom of table No.

3). The question asked in this survey since 1966 has been: "As far as people in charge of

running Congress are concerned, would you say you have a great deal of confidence, only

some confidence, or hardly any confidence at all in them?" Below are the data that the Harris

Poll publishes on its website regarding the category of “a great deal of confidence”:

According to this table between 1966 and 1971 a sharp decline occurred in public opinion,

and since then the fluctuations have not been significant. This also manifests itself in the

index for public trust in the leaders of all the government and public institutions in the U.S.

2.3. Public Trust in Members of Parliament

From the data it transpires that the level of trust which the public has in parliament, does not

necessarily correspond to that in members of the parliament. There are states in which the

members of parliament enjoy greater trust than does the parliament – especially in countries

in which the members are elected in direct elections. The main reason for the difference is

that the expectations from them as individuals are different than the expectations from the

parliament as a body. In several countries it is the parliament which enjoys greater trust.15

Surprisingly enough the Knesset Index found that in Israel trust in Members of the Knesset

is greater than trust in the Knesset itself, even though Israel has a system of proportional

representation. The explanation given to the phenomenon by those who performed the survey

was that: “The public is aware of the fact that there are Members of the Knesset who perform

their job loyally, and measure up to the test of the result. However, the prominence that the

media gives negatives behavior by other Members of the Knesset reflects on the functioning

of the Knesset as a whole, and its negative contribution is more significant”.16 It is possible

that had the Knesset Index been prepared in the course of the Sixteenth Knesset (2003-6) the

results would have been different.

14

In the U.S., where many studies have been done on the fact that Members of the Congress

are better liked than Congress itself, it transpires that the situation is much more complicated:

citizens usually like their own Representatives and Senators, and not Members of the

Congress in general.17 In New Zealand as well, it was found that the public has more respect

and more trust in the local Member of Parliament, than in Members of Parliament in

general.18

2.4. The Trust of the Israeli Public in the Knesset

From an initial comparison between the findings of the Knesset Index and the data from other

parliaments in the world one might conclude that the situation in Israel is worse than that in

the Western democracies, and that the level of trust in the Knesset is as low as that in Latin

America (See table No. 6) and in the states of Eastern Europe that were part of the Soviet bloc

in the past (See table No. 7).19

as originally thought. According to figure No. 3, based on the European Social Survey (ESS)

survey for 2002, on a scale of 0-10 trust of the Israeli public (IL) in the Knesset was 4.7 – a

little under the average for the states that participated in the survey, which stood at 4.9. A

possible explanation for the apparent contradiction is the different methods used in the

surveys (For a methodological discussion see Appendix No. 2 on p. X).

3. The Professional Literature

The professional literature that deals with public trust in parliaments, focuses on the following

issues: the theoretical term “trust”, especially within the context of studies about “social

capital”; the reasons for the decline in public trust in parliaments in specific states, focusing

on the specific conditions in those states; the reasons and explanations for the decline trend in

public trust in government institutions in general, and in parliaments in particular in all the

Western democratic states (Western Europe, Northern America, Australia and New Zealand).

The foundations for this literature were laid at the end of the 1960s by American academics,

and European academics working in the United States.

3.1. The Term “Trust”

The term trust is associated in many studies with another term from the sphere of sociology –

“social capital”. The term social capital first appeared in the professional literature in the

1960s, and its usage became widespread following studies by the sociologists James

Coleman,20 and Robert Putman.21 Social capital is made up of social phenomena, the

presence of which ensures cooperation in the society and, inter alia, enables the existence of

democracy, economic prosperity and social development.22 One of the components of social

capital is trust in individuals, and trust in social and government institutions.23

Many sociologists deal with the definition of the term “trust”, and the analysis of the

origins of trust. When one speaks of general trust there is a distinction among three

hypotheses in analyzing its sources. Two of the hypotheses are socio-psychological that see

in the inclination to trust an integral of a person’s personality and condition: the first of the

two focuses on his childhood experiences, and the second focuses on general personal

characteristics such as social status, level of income, education, gender, ethnic origin and age.

The third hypothesis does not deal with the individual but with collective characteristics of

the society.24 When we are speaking of trust in government institutions the analysis is more

complex, and will be dealt with below.

One of the questions asked by the researchers concerns the correlation between trust in

human beings and trust in institutions. Eric Uslaner examined 42 states and found that the

20 See for example: Coleman (1988). 21 See for example: Putman (1993). 22 A good summary on social capital may be found in Christoforou (2004). 23 Putnam (1993). 24 Delhay & Newton (2004).

correlation between trust in human beings and trust in parliament in low (r=0.154). 25 The

data from the European Social Survey (ESS) suggest that this is not so, and that there is a high

level of correlation between the two, since the order of the states in the tables that compare

trust in parliament and trust in human beings is similar:

especially low are Ireland – in favor of trust in human beings, and Hungary and Greece – in

favor of parliament.

According to the data of the World Value Survey, only in Australia, Iceland and Belgium

is the level of the public’s trust in parliament greater than the level of its trust in human

beings in all the years examined, and only in Denmark is the trust in human beings greater

than in parliament (see table No. 9).26

* ‘A great deal’ and ‘quite a lot’ ** ‘People can be trusted’ There are scholars who perceive an in-built paradox in the relationship between democracy

and trust. The classical liberal political theory was based on the lack of trust in government.27

Som Christensen and Per Lægreid point out that, on the one hand, the legitimacy of political

and administrative institutions, and of significant players in the political process is based, to a

large extent, on trust, and on the other hand, an essential element in democracy is “a healthy

lack of confidence”, or at least skepticism regarding the interests of others, especially those

who have power.28 In a study prepared for the OECD it was noted that a certain level of lack

of confidence in the Government is healthy, and may be functional since it serves as a

guarantee for accountability.29

Finally, it should be noted that not all academics are impressed by the mere occupation of

their colleagues with the subject of public trust in institutions of government. The British

philosopher Onora O’Neill’s stated in a series of lectures she gave in 2002, within the

27 Hardin (2002). 28 Christensen & Lægreid (2003). See also Warren (1999), and Warren (2004). 29 Pollitt & Bouckært (2000).

framework of the BBC on the subject of trust, that there is no proof that there has been a

deterioration in the degree of trust that the public has in government institutions, but there is

the fact that the public says that there has been a decline in the degree of trust it has:

“Growing mistrust would be a reasonable response to growing untrustworthiness; but the

evidence that people or institutions are less trustworthy is elusive. In fact I think there isn’t

even good evidence that we trust less. “We say we trust less: we tell the pollsters, they tell the

media, and the news that we say we do not trust is then put into circulation…”30

The Israeli philosopher Edna Ullmann-Margalit objects to concept of trust or lack of trust

in institutions, since these institutions as such have no intentions, and consequently the term

“trust” is not relevant in so far as they are concerned.31 Gabriela Montinola adds that citizens

are unable to trust government institutions, since they do not have the objective knowledge

about those institutions, on the basis of which is it possible to define trust. On the other hand,

they do have the basis for expressing lack of confidence, especially when one is speaking of

corruption.32

3.2. Public Trust in Government Institutions in General, and in Parliament in Particular in Specific States. The studies that focus on the situation in specific states usually attempt to explain the level of

trust in them on the basis of the unique characteristics and conditions in each of them.

Frequently the researchers make use of analytical frameworks developed in the U.S., with the

intentions of checking whether the findings in the U.S .correspond with those in the states

being examined, and whether the conclusions from these findings are applicable to them.33

In Belgium, for example, it has been claimed that the reasons for the distance between

citizens and government institutions in general, and parliament in particular include, inter

alia, dissatisfaction from the performance of Members of Parliament, and the on-going

budgetary crisis in the country - especially the vast dimensions of the national debt, which

results in around 40% of the budget being devoted to debt service.34

In Ireland it has been claimed that the lack of confidence in the Oireachtas (the lower

house of the Parliament) results, to a large extent, from the large number of Members, who

30 O’Neill (2002), p. 44. 31 Ullmann-Margalit (2004). 32 Montinola (2004). 33 See for example the study by Elim Papadakis about Australia: Papadakis (1999), and the attempt to explain the low level of trust in government institutions in general and in parliament in particular in New Zealand: State Services Commission of New Zealand (2000). 34 De Winter (2002).

20

serve simultaneously in local and municipal authorities (in the 1997 elections the rate was

70%), and consequently do not devote sufficient time to dealing with national issues.35

As to Italy, it has been claimed that the background to the low level of trust in parliament

is that even though the Parliament filled an important role in the establishment of a liberal

democracy in Italy after the Second World War, it never turned into an arena in which “the

citizens connects with the state”. Vincent Della Sala referred to the phenomenon as a breach

between the palazzo (the palace) and the piazza (the square). He argued that in the first 30

years of the Republic much of the parliamentary work was performed in secret, and that the

public was not aware of what exactly was going on in it, believing that what had been will

continue to be. At the end of the 1980s amendments started to be introduced into the Rules of

Procedure of the House of Representatives in order to make its work more transparent, but in

the beginning of the 1990s an unending row of corruption affairs began (in the course of the

term of the 11th House of Representatives [1992-1994] around one third of the Members of

the House were under investigation or in trial on various criminal charges), and therefore it

was impossible to examine what influence the reforms had had on public trust.36

Christina Leston-Bandeira claimed that in Portugal, even though public trust in parliament

is not especially low, there is nevertheless a problem, which is not that the public has a

negative opinion on parliament, but that it has no opinion at all. Most of the citizens do not

distinguish between the legislature and the executive. The reason for this phenomenon is ,

according to Leson-Bandeira, historical, and she believes that reforms in the work of

parliament and its relations with the public, in addition to the reforms that were already

implemented after Portugal returned to being a democracy in 1976, could change the

situation.37

In Germany it was found that the reasons for the negative public opinion towards the

Bundestag in the last decade are, inter alia, weariness with politics (known in German as

politikverdrossenheit),38 and the superficial coverage by the media of the Parliament, despite

the existence of a parliamentary television channel – Phœnix.39 Public trust in government

institutions in general and in the Bundestag in particular has declined since the reunification

35 O'Halpin (2003). 36 Della Sala (1997), and Della Sala (2002). 37 Leson-Bandeira (2002a), and Leston-Bandeira (2002b). 38 Kepplinger (1996). 39 Marschall (1998).

of Germany, due to the difficult economic and social situation in what used to be East

Germany.40 The following table presents the problem.

In Sweden several causes were found to the decline in public trust in parliament from the end

of the 1960s to the end of the 1990s: the deterioration in the Swedish economy, which began

in the early 1970s and accelerated in the course of the 1990s; the introduction of television

into the homes in the 1960s; the inclination of the media to adopt a much more critical and

negative position than in the past towards the parties and the politicians; the development of a

credibility crisis in the two main parties, but especially in the ruling Social Democratic Party,

which resulted in ever growing gaps between citizens’ expectations and the performance of

the parties.41

In Finland it was claimed that since the traditional tasks, which used to be performed by

the Parliament in the sphere of protection of the citizen in his daily life, and the tools that

were placed in its hands to perform these tasks have diminished, the citizen lost his trust in

the legislature.42

Russel Dalton proposes specific explanations for the situation in several countries:43 in

Great Britain the decline in trust is connected with the economic struggle within the nation; in

Canada it is connected with the struggle among the English speaking Provinces and the

French speaking Provinces;44 and in Austria – with the collapse of the social-liberal

consensus. Nevertheless, Dalton’s conclusion is that the specific explanations are

insufficient, since the phenomenon exists in most states.

40 See for example: Fuchs (1999). 41 Sören Holmberg (1999). 42 Tiihonen (1998). 43 Dalton (2004). 44 In another study about Canada it was found that that the phenomenon of constant deterioration in public trust in government institutions has economic, social and political causes, as well as the reporting by the media. As to Parliament, it was argued that the absence of a code of conduct for Members of the Federal Parliament affects public opinion (Szekula & Averill, 2001).

22

In a survey prepared by the Scottish Office in Great Britain regarding the involvement of

the civil society in the work of the Parliament in several European countries, the ability of the

citizens to influence the legislative process was examined. The basic assumption was that the

more the citizens feel that they can influence legislation, so their satisfaction with the

functioning of the Parliament, and their trust in it grows. The authors of the survey reached

the conclusion that in Austria the involvement of citizens, and consultations with workers and

employers representatives in the legislative process are the most developed. According to

them, the explanation of the Austrians themselves to this phenomenon is that since for many

years Austria maintained a neutral foreign policy that isolated the state to a certain degree, its

leaders tried to preserve the internal social consensus, in an attempt to fulfill the wishes of the

largest number of citizens, including national minorities. For a certain period after Austria

entered the EU, the involvement of the non-governmental bodies in the legislative process

weakened, and public trust in the Parliament declined, but in the years after the survey of the

Scottish Office was written, this trend reversed itself.45

In the mid-1990s Joseph Nye and Philip Zelikow presented the following table, which

offers various hypotheses regarding the decline in public trust in the Administration in the

United States, and the degree to which each of the hypotheses offer a satisfactory explanation

of the phenomenon:46

1. Scope grown too fast (as measured by GDP).

Low Scope increased from 3% to 20% but largest growth is in programs that are popular (Social Security, Medicare). Does not explain other institutions. 2. Scope grown too intrusive (measured by new subjects).

Mixed Timing about right regarding onset and persistence, but causal link is somewhat indirect. Unclear relation to other institutions and countries. 17. Authority patterns and postmaterialist values, particularly since 1960s.

High Fits all institutions and countries. Does not explain all variations.

Several scholars have argued that the problem of the low level of trust in Congress in the U.S.

might be a false problem, because from the end of the Second World War until the mid 1960s

the level of public trust in Congress, as well as in the other government institutions, was

exceptionally high, and the norm is the lower levels of trust that appeared later on.48

The generations theory of Strauss and Howe, according to which there is in the U.S. a

cycle made up of a succession of four types of generations, each of which has its own unique

characteristics,49 corroborates this argument. After the end of the Second World War a

generation, which Strauss and Howe call the “silent generation”, came of age; this generation

was characterized as conformist, calm and conservative, and was inclined to trust its leaders

and government institutions. The next generation was the generation of the baby-boomers,

born between the years 1943-60, identified with the culture of the Sixties, the counter-culture

and the consciousness revolution, and is characterized as idealistic and revolutionary. This

48 This argument is presented in articles and books published by the sociologist Pippa Norris in the years 1990-2000, in which she presents data from the National Election Studies. See also Table No. 11. 49 Stauss & Howe (1991).

24

generation came of age in the years in which a sharp decline in public trust in government

institutions was first observed.50

3.3. The Reasons for the Decline in Trust, and for the Low Level of Trust in Government Institutions and Parliament Various scholars have suggested different ways of dividing schools of thought and hypotheses

to explain the phenomenon of the decline in trust, and the low level of trust in government

institutions. So, for example, William Mishler and Richard Rose divided the hypotheses into

two schools (or “theoretical traditions”): the cultural school and the institutional school.

According to them these do not necessarily contradict each other. The theories in each of

these schools may be divided, according to them, into theories on the macro level and theories

on the micro level.51

According to the cultural school the level of trust in government institutions emanates

from sources that are exogenous to the political system. The theories on the macro level in

this school, emphasize the homogeneous trends of national traditions as the source for the

level of trust, and do not leave much room for differences among human beings as individuals

in each society. The theories on the micro level focus on differences in the socialization

experiences of the individual as the source of the level of trust.

The institutional school, on the other hand, argues that the level of trust emanates from

endogenous sources in the political system. The theories on the macro level in this school,

emphasize the functioning of government institutions on issues such as encouraging growth,

effectiveness of the administration, and avoidance of corruption. The theories on the micro

level emphasize that individual evaluations concerning the functioning of the institutions, are

conditioned by the preferences and experience of the individual, such as his position on the

question what is more important – political integrity or economic growth – and if the person

personally experienced the consequences of corruption, or the advantages of economic

growth.

We decided to divide the explanations into three levels: (1) explanations according to

which government institutions have lost public trust because there is an objective problem in

the way they function, and they deserve the low level of trust in them; (2) explanations that

deal with the individual, in other words, in the reasons for why each citizen feels as he does

towards the government institutions, such as his personality, status in society, and personal

50 We approached Strauss and Howe with the question whether in their opinion this hypothesis is correct, and both agreed that it is (Howe, e-mail from November 2, 2005; Struass, e-mail from November 4, 2005. 51 Mishler & Richard Rose (2001).

25

experience; (3) explanations that deal with influences that might be defied as systemic,

environmental and/or social.

3.3.1 Explanations Connected with the Functioning of the Institutions

On the first level are the explanations according to which human beings have lost their trust in

parliaments because the parliaments and their members are objectively not worthy of trust, for

whatever reasons. Numerous studies deal with the decline in parliamentarism in the

democratic world as an apparently objective phenomenon that could explain, at least partially,

the decline in the trust that the public expresses in parliament, apart from the trust that it

expresses in other government institutions.

Already in 1921 John Bryce wrote about a phenomenon which he called “the decline of

parliaments”. In his opinion the 19th Century was the golden age of liberal parliamentarism.

Its decline in the 20th Century manifested itself in the rise in the power of the parties that limit

the ability of Members of the Parliament to express their opinions freely, in the decline in the

quality of candidates for seats in Parliament, and in the excessive institutionalization of the

work of Parliament that causes the investment of time in procedure at the expense of social

responsibility.52

Another academic who dealt with this issue from the end of the 1920s was the German

Philosopher Carl Schmitt. Schmitt argued that party politics do not enable Parliament to

connect the civil society with the State, and that liberal parliamentarism is unable to fulfill its

task in the democratic state properly, and carry on a real debate on the issues on the public

agenda.53

In the 1950s Schmitt developed the concept of "Motorized Legislation". This concept is

based on the argument that in the modern world, because of the growing scope of legislation,

and the accelerated speed in which it must be passed, the parliament is unable to deal

seriously with the job of legislation, which is its main task.54 If there is dissatisfaction with

the legislative process in general, in the case of the approval of the state budget the

dissatisfaction is even greater, given that the volume of the budget laws, and the speed in

which they must be approved are constantly growing.55

52 Bryce (1921). 53 See for example: Schmitt (1962). 54 Scheuerman (2004). 55 For a discussion of the issue see for example: Schick (2002), Stepenhutst, and Savirsky (2002).

26

There are those who argue that the manner in which parliaments run their affairs is archaic

and irrelevant.56 Others remind us that the bottom line is that public trust depends on the

degree to which public institutions, including parliaments "supply the goods", in other words,

fulfill their functions and tasks in a satisfactory manner; if the level of public trust is

declining, then apparently they are not doing so.57 Unethical or even corrupt conduct by civil

servants and members of parliament, also leads to a decline in public trust in public

institutions and in parliament.58

same year, on public perceptions regarding the level of corruption in them. In table No. 12

we focused on the data relating to parliaments. The Eurobarometer brings data regarding the

rate of those interviewed who answered that they are inclined to trust parliament, while

Transparency International asked those interviewed to choose a reply from 1 - an evaluation

that there is no corruption in parliament - to 5 - an evaluation that there is much corruption.

We found a high correlation between the two groups of data in all the countries, except

Greece.

3.3.2. Explanations based on personal variables

On the second level the focus is on the human beings, who express their level of trust in

government institutions. An analysis of the responses is based on gender, social background,

level of education, economic condition etc. The researchers who conduct studies at this level

frequently use correlations. Thus, Pedro Magalhães found that the correlation between the

level of education and degree of trust in parliament in positive on a low level in 13 of 15

states that were members of the EU before the enlargement (the exceptions were Greece and

Portugal). In all the states the correlation between being unemployed and trust in parliament

is negative at a high level. As to other variables, the study did not come up with significant

findings.60

Russel Dalton found that at the end of the 1950s and beginning of the 1960s educated

Americans had more trust in the Administration, but over time the level of trust of those with

a higher education declined more sharply than among those with less education. In addition,

the erosion in political trust and trust in politicians among wealthy Americans was greater

than among the poor.61

Kenneth Newton and Pippa Norris found that gender, social status and age usually have

little influence on trust in institutions. Nevertheless, women, members of the middle class

and older persons have more trust.62 In a study about Japan it was found that trust in various

aspects of political life is lower in urban areas, and among youngsters and the educated.63

3.3.3. Systemic, Environmental and Social Explanations

On the third level the researchers seek systemic, environmental and social factors that

influence the level of trust. Inter alia researchers examined how the electoral system

60 Magalhães (2004). 61 Dalton (2005). 62 Newton & Norris (2000). 63 Pharr (1997),

28

prevalent in each country affects the level of its citizens' trust in its government institutions. It

was found that in states in which the level of proportionality in the election results is higher,

and the system of government is consensual, the level of trust is higher than in states in which

the system of elections is majoritarian.64

There are those who conclude from the fact that in most states the level of trust in the local

and regional government institutions is higher than the level of trust in national institutions

(see for example the data on Italy and the Czech Republic below), that the smaller the size of

government authorities, the greater the trust in them.65

they call the first the overload hypothesis, according to which the over expansion of the

public sector caused a rise in the public’s expectations, which the government institutions are

unable to fulfill.66 They call the second the new politics hypothesis, according to which

citizens in the post-materialist era are interested in new issues and spheres that do not

64 See for example: Anderson & Guillory (1997), and Magalhães (2002). 65 See for example: Denters (2002). 66 See also the document ordered by the Audit Commission, an independent British public body whose job is to ensure that public money is spent efficiently in the sphere of local government: Duffy, Downing & Skinner (2003).

29

manifest themselves in the traditional politics.67 They call the third the negative media

hypothesis,68 Many argue that the modern media is responsible for the low level of trust, for it

focuses on divergent and negative phenomenon in its reporting, and is inclined to be critical,

which results in the public not receiving a balanced and accurate picture.69

Neil Nevitte and Mebs Kanji divide the explanations regarding levels of public satisfaction

and levels of public trust, a little differently. They present four explanations, each of which

belongs to the social-cultural sphere:70 The first focuses on changes that have taken place in

the society’s values, and is based on the argument that post-materialistic values cause people

to be more critical towards traditional hierarchical institutions. The second focuses on

structural changes in the society that result from the rise in the level of education, and the

scope of the means at the disposal of the citizens. These changes do, in fact, lead to greater

interest and involvement in government and democracy, but also to a more critical approach

towards the government. The third explanation focuses on the erosion that has taken place in

the social capital (see above), as a result of which the citizens’ satisfaction with the

government and their trust in it have eroded. The fourth is based on theories, which Harry

Eckstein developed in the 1960s. These theories focus on changes that took place in various

societies regarding the acceptance of authority within the family, in the work place and on the

political level. These changes have undermined the satisfaction with the Administration, and

had a negative effect on the trust in it, and loyalty to it.

3.4. Public Trust in Democracy and Parliament

The greatest concern of those who deal with the decline in the public's trust in government

institutions in general, and parliament in particular, is that this will affect the public's trust in

and support of democracy. Already in the 1970s two approaches to the problem were

presented. In 1974 Arthur Miller argued that the whole democratic system is in danger.71 In

1975 Michel Crozier, Samuel Huntington and Jōji Watanuki also expressed concern regarding

the steadfastness of democracy.72 Jack Citrin presented the opposite approach, without

67 See an expansion of this issue in Inglehart (1997), and Dalton (2000). 68 Laurence E. Rose & Pettersen (1999). 69 See for example: Neustadt (1997), and Dalton (2004) pp. 71-74. 70 Nevitte & Kanji (2002). 71 Miller (1974a), and Miller (1974b). 72 Crozier, Huntington & Watanuki (1975).

30

ignoring the symptoms.73 In the 1980s, the years in which Reaganism flourished in the U.S.

and Thatcherism in Great Britain, it seemed as though the public in the democratic countries

became a little less critical. After the collapse of the Soviet Bloc everyone concentrated on

the victory of democracy, and the question whether indeed "the end of history" had arrived.74

However, in the 1990s once again public trust in the institutions of democratic government

was undermined, and questions started being asked about the steadfastness of democracy.

31

Today most of the scholars argue that the lack of trust in government institutions does not

necessarily prove that the status of democracy has been undermined. Empirical data

corroborate this argument. According to table 15 above it appears that at least in Europe there

is no reason to worry: in all the states except Hungary, Romania, Turkey and Turkish Cyprus,

satisfaction with democracy is greater than trust in parliament. Only in a few states is the

difference between the two smaller than 10%: Italy, Greece, Portugal, Estonia, Lithuania,

Slovakia and Croatia.

The Sociologist Ronald Inglehart, who wrote extensively on the phenomenon of the

decline of public trust in government institutions, also reached the conclusion that it does not

endanger the steadfastness of democracy.75

3.5. Proposals for Reforms

Part of the scholars who deal with the analysis of the phenomenon of low trust in government

institutions in general, and parliaments in particular, also propose ways of dealing with the

problem . In addition, in recent years an extensive literature has developed on reforms in

public administration in general, and specific institutions in particular, and one of the goals of

the reforms is to bring the public closer to them.76

In a study prepared by the London Economist in the year 2000on the crisis that has

befallen the democratic countries in the sphere of public trust, the following solutions were

offered: limiting the scope of activity of the government establishment, which had over

extended (in the opinion of the Economist) in recent decades, so that the balance between

what was promised the voters, and what can be implemented, is returned; the development of

new forms of citizen participation in the democratic process; reforms in the system of

elections as proposed in states like Italy, Great Britain, Japan, and New Zealand; changes in

the laws for financing politicians and parties; limitations on the power of parliaments by

means of judicial review.77

In 2001, after analyzing hypotheses regarding the phenomenon of declining public trust in

government and other public institutions, the German Sociologist Helmut Klages stated in a

document that he presented at a conference of the European Group of Public Administration,

that one should act in the direction of developing a civil society, in which active civic

participation is prevalent in the public decision making process. This can be attained by

enabling and empowering citizens for such activity. The more involved the citizens in the

75 Inglehart (1999a). 76 See for example: Pollitt & Bouckært (2000). 77 Economist (2000).

32

decision making processes, so the delving on the question of trust in government and public

institutions will decline, even though it will not disappear completely. Klages points out that

such a development largely depends on the conduct of the elites, and in their ability to prove

that the general good is at the top of the concerns and that they are willing to use their full

ability and power to realize the goal. Klages adds that the conditions for realizing the goal

are, inter alia, improving the processes for selecting position holders, laying down rules of

ethics for their conduct, and improving the way the mass media operates, so that it will be less

populist in its approach.78 Another German scholar, Stephan Marschall, proposed that an

effective public relations system be developed, to introduce parliamentary reforms, especially

reforms that are photogenic, and improve communications with the public by means of the

Internet.79

As to the U.S., John Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss-Morse proposed in 1995 several ways

of contending with the problem of negative public opinion towards Congress. Among the

solutions that they discussed: a change in the work procedures in Congress, and the condition

of service in it; a change in the policy of Congress; the spreading of knowledge on the subject

of the work of Congress; the spreading of knowledge on the essence of democracy. At the

same time they warned against procedural changes that will not enable Congress to operate

professionally.80

4. Measures Taken in Parliaments to Deal with the Problem of Trust

4.1. Public Opinion Polls

Of the 21 responses we received on the questionnaire we sent to the Secretaries General of

various parliaments it transpires that only the parliaments of Austria and Sweden initiated

public opinion surveys concerning their public image in the last decade, but not on the scale

of the Knesset Index. We also found that the American Congress prepared such a survey in

1977 for the purpose of preparing a report on reforms in its work.81 The only country in which

a deep and detailed study regarding public opinion towards parliament that is similar to the

Knesset Index, was also the U.S. We are referring to the study by scholars John Hibbing and

Elizabeth Theiss-Morse of 1992, mentioned above, which like the Knesset Index is based on a

78 Klages (2001). 79 Marschall (1998). 80 Hibbing & Theiss-Morse (1995). 81 See: Davidson (1979).

33

quantitative and in-depth study, but unlike the Knesset Index it dealt non only with the

legislature, but with the executive and the judiciary as well.82

In most of the responses we received it was pointed out that surveys are conducted by

private institutions, and some even sent us the results of such surveys. None of the responses

mentioned that there are several bodies that conduct comparative surveys on an international

level, which deal, inter alia, with public trust in government institutions, including

parliament.

4.2. Measures to Improve the Image

All the parliaments are concerned with their image. According to the evidence of the

Secretaries General, each of the parliaments engages in extensive information and education

activities: the operation of a website, which, inter alia, enables the public, to contact the

parliament; the distribution of printed publications; the organization of visits and tours for the

general public in the parliament buildings; educational activities among pupils and citizens,

and efforts to improve the relations with the media.

None of the Secretaries General connected these activities directly to the findings of public

opinion surveys, even though the impression that emerged from the responses to the

questionnaires was that most of the Secretaries General are aware of the fact that the public

does not express much trust in parliament and other government institutions, and is usually

dissatisfied with its representatives.

In France the decline in the level of public trust in the National Assembly does not

especially concern the parliament itself or scholars.83 Despite this, the French National

Assembly involved its Members in laying down a new media strategy. The Secretary General

of the House of Representatives in New Zealand sent us data that show that the level of trust

of the public in Parliament is extremely low – 17% in 2001 and 22% in 2002, but argued that

parliament was not doing anything to address the problem.84

Only a few of the Secretaries General mentioned plans for instituting reforms in the work

of parliament. Thus, for example, the Secretary General of the Belgian House of

Representatives wrote that measures had been taken on the subject of the ethics of Members

82 Hibbing and Theiss-Morse (1995). 83 Prof. Pierre Bréchon of Grenoble University agreed with this statement in an e-mail message sent on august 3, 2005. Prof. Bréchon is one of the few academics in France, who has dealt in any way with this subject in his research. 84 In 1998 a committee, made up of former Speakers of the New Zealand House of Representatives, published a report on “Restoring Public confidence in Parliament”, but we do not know what came of it. See: Harrison (1998).

34

of Parliament: the positions that a Member may hold and the salary that he may earn outside

the parliament.85

From information that we gathered independently we found that in many parliaments

reforms in various spheres of their work are being discussed, and such reforms are being

implemented. In these deliberations the need to improve the connection between parliament

and the public are occasionally mentioned, but there is never any specific mention of the

results of public opinion surveys. It should be noted that in Great Britain, where in the last

five years numerous committees have dealt with proposals for reforms,86 especially low levels

of trust in parliament have been registered in the last decade.87

The Secretaries General of the Australian House of Representatives and of the Czech

Chamber of Deputies mentioned that they do not consider themselves responsible for the

image of Members of the Parliament and of the Parliamentary Groups, even though the image

of the Parliament may be influenced by the image of the Members and their Parties. The

Clerk of the Australian House of Representatives, for example, sent us surveys that show that

in the sphere of ethics and integrity Members of the Parliament are in a low place in public

opinion compared to other position holders and professionals.

All the Secretaries General are aware of the importance of the media in connection with

the image of their parliament, but none of them described what they do in order to improve

the connection between parliament and the media. The relations between parliament and the

media were dealt with in great detail by the British Commonwealth of Nations at a special

session that took place in Australia in February 2003. One of the conclusions was that one

should introduce legislation that obliges the media to report parliamentary activities fairly and

accurately, even though it was argued that inaccurate reporting should not be regarded as

contempt of parliament, and one must distinguish between such reporting, and reporting that

damages the ability of parliament o fulfill its functions.88

85 The possibility of establishing a code of ethics in the Belgian House of Representatives, on the basis of a code of ethics adopted in the Flemish national parliament, but so far no decision was taken (information sent by the Legal Advisor of the Belgian House of Representatives, Mr. Marc Van Der Hulst, on December 7, 2004). It should be noted that the only parliaments which currently have codes of ethics or codes of conduct, as opposed to rules of conduct or rules of ethics, are the British Parliament and the American Congress. The topic of ethics was discussed in connection with trust in Government within the framework of the OECD. See OECD (2000). 86 Among the reports prepared by committees in the British House of Commons and outside of it the following are worthy of special mention: House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee on Public Participation (2001);

House of Commons Information Select Committee (2002); House of Commons Modernisation Select Committee (2004) (see conclusions in Appendix No 1); Hansard Society Commission on the Communication of Parliamentary Democracy (2005). 87 See the document of the Strategic Unit in the British Prime Minister’s Office: Strategic Unit (2002). 88 Bouchet (2002).

35

Some parliaments have decided to deal with the phenomenon of “hostile media” by means

of parliamentary television channels, in which an attempt is made to deal in a serious, non sensational and balanced manner with all the issues that emerge in a democratic country in

general, and in parliamentary life in particular.89 However, this solution is not without

problems. One of them is the low viewing rates of the parliamentary channels. In France and

Germany the viewing rates are indeed extremely low.90 Nevertheless, in Israel public opinion

surveys prepared by the “Dahaf” Institute, found respectable viewing rates: on April 17, 2005

it was found that 5.9% of the public watch the Knesset Channel frequently, and another 9.7%

watch it occasionally, and on January 25, 2006 it was found that 6.7% watch it frequently and

another 13.2 occasionally.91

It appears that most of the initiatives for improving the image of parliament, or improving

the relations between the parliament and the public come from Members of Parliament, and

not from the administrative apparatus of the parliaments. The Speakers of the Houses of

Representative of Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden are actively involved in

formulating their images. The Speaker of the Second Chamber of the States General of the

Netherlands, for example, writes a weekly column on the website of the House. In the British

House of Commons, discussions on reform take place in bodies in which Members of

Parliament are members – parliamentary committees and extra-parliamentary commissions,

such as those set up by the Hansard Society (an independent, non-partisan educational charity,

whose goal is to promote effective parliamentary democracy, and assists parliament in a

practical way in such areas as the development of e-democracy).92

Since the year 2000 several resolutions were adopted by the Third Committee of the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU) regarding the participation of the civil society in the work of

parliaments. The Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments (ASGP), within the

framework of the IPU also raised the issue for discussion.93 Professor David Beetham is

currently preparing a wide scale research project on parliaments and democracy for the IPU,

89 For a review of television channels in several parliaments see: Tabibian-Mizrahi (2003). 90 Regarding France see: Chaine Parlementaire: 10,000 Euros par Telespectateur, http://www.libres.org/francais/actualite/archives/actualite_0303/chaine_parlementaire_a8_1003.htm. Regarding Germany see Marschall (2003). 91 We should like to thank the management of the Knesset Channel, and Attorney Dan Landau, Chief of the Speaker’s Staff, for providing us with the results of three surveys held since the Channel was inaugurated in May 2004. 92 See: Parry (2004) and Pearce (2001). 93 See Forsberg (2004).

36

which is dealing, inter alia, with trust in parliaments.94 None of the Secretaries General

mentioned such activities in their response.

We found that in several parliaments there are apparatuses designed to encourage the

participation of the civil society in the parliamentary work. We are speaking of the

participation of citizens, as individuals and as groups, in the legislation process, the

involvement of citizens in the deliberations of parliamentary Committees by means of the

Internet (such participation took place in the 16th Knesset (2003-6) in the Constitution, Law

and Justice Committee, and occurs in Great Britain95, and in Germany96), and in citizens'

conferences on concrete issues on the parliamentary agenda.97 The origin of the institution

known as "citizens' conferences" is in Denmark. In 1986 the Danish Folketinget established a

body called the Danish Board of Technology, the tasks of which are to encourage informed

debates by the public, and to serve as an independent advisor to the Folketinget on

technological issues, with the goal of attaining the involvement of the public in the decision

making process. The Board approaches experts in the issues with which it is dealing, but in

its own decision making process it involves people from the general public, by means such as

Consensus Conferences. The connection between the Board and the Folketinget is close. It

responds to questions posed by Members of the Folketinget and occasionally initiates

approaches to them, participates in meetings of parliamentary Committees, and reports to the

Folketinget on the course of its work. Not always does the Board have a direct impact, and

not all the Members of the Folketinget are enthusiastic about its activity. 98

The Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives was the only Secretary General who

mentioned the existence of an extensive academic literature dealing with the issues of the low

level of trust in government institutions, including parliaments, in the democratic states, and

the decline in the level of trust in the last decade. This fact does not necessarily prove that the

parliaments are not ware of the existence of this literature, which they can use when they

94 Inter-Parliamentary Union (2005). We have contributed information on the subject of public trust in parliament to this study. 95 See: http://www.democracyforum.org.uk/edemocracy.asp. 96 Marschall (2003). 97 A comprehensive study on the issue of the participation of the civil society in the work of parliaments was prepared in the Scottish Office in Great Britain towards the establishment of the Scottish Parliament. See Scottish Office (1998). A similar document was prepared in the Australian Parliament, Verspaadonk (2001). עבודה ממצה בנושא שיתוף החברה האזרחית בעבודת פרלמנטים הוכנה במשרד הסקוטי בבריטניה לקראת הקמת הפרלמנט של סקוטלנד . ראו Scottish Office (1998) .מסמך דומה הוכן גם ב ספרייה של ה פרלמנט של אוסטרלי , ה Verspaadonk (2001). 98 Heierbacher (2002).

37

come to deal with the problem, but it is possible that greater awareness would enable them to

deal with it more effectively. Only the Secretary General of the Portuguese Assembly of the

Republic pointed out that members of academia play a role in the effort to improve the

functioning and image of the Parliament. This is done within the framework of an ad-hoc

committee for reform of the political system. In Great Britain we found that members of

academia have appeared before committees that have dealt with reforms, but these have

usually been experts on technical issues such as communications and the Internet, and not

researchers who deal with the causes of the phenomenon of the low level of trust - in other

words, Social Scientists.

4.3. Do Reforms in the Work of the Government and the Parliament Affect the Level of

Trust in Them?

In studies written in Great Britain, in which numerous reforms have been introduced in the

last decade on the constitutional, governmental and parliamentary levels, it was found that the

effect of such reforms on public opinion has been, at best, temporary. Therefore one might

conclude that the low level of trust does not result only from poor performance, or

performance that does not measure us to expectations. A study by Catherine Bromley, John

Curtis, and Ben Seyd, which dealt with the constitutional reforms introduced by the Labor

Government at the end of the 1990s, points out that even though the reforms were popular,

their effect on the level of public trust in Government was short lived.99 According to a study

by Caroline Tolbert and Karen Mossberger, which dealt with improving the quality of the

service provided by the Government by means of on-line services, the development of these

services did not influence the level of trust felt by the public towards the Government either,

despite the rise in the level of satisfaction with the approachability of the Government.100

In New Zealand it was found that reforms, which were introduced in the 1990s, and were

designed to increase accessibility of government institutions to the public, did not manage to

change the trend of decline in trust. 101 In Portugal it was found that over 25 years of

reforms in the work of the parliament (in the years 1976-2002) did not lead to any change in

the trust of the public in parliament. Christine Leston-Bandeira wondered whether the reason

for this might be the fact that those who introduced the reforms did not bother to check what

the public thought before acting.102

99 Bromley, Curtis & Seyd (2001). 100 Tolbert & Mossberger (2003). Trust in a particular institutions and satisfaction with the way it operates is not one and the same thing, though satisfaction is a condition for trust. 101 State Services Commission of New Zealand (2000). 102 Leston-Bandeira (2002b).

38

Tom Christensen and Per Lægreid, who examined the situation in Norway - where,

according to them the public is inclined to be conservative with regards to reforms - wondered

whether the satisfaction with the functioning of the Government and the opinions regarding

reforms in public institutions are what influences trust in them, or the other way around: the

inclination to trust leads to satisfaction with the way democracy functions and creates

traditional (or alternatively, modernistic) approaches towards the public sector. Their

conclusion was that we are dealing with processes, which are interdependent in a vicious

circle. In other word, the answer to the question whether there is any chance that reforms

will affect the level of public trust in government institutions is not unequivocal. 103

The three researchers who prepared background material on the issue of strengthening

trust in governments for the OECD towards the ministerial meeting that took place in

Rotterdam in the Netherlands on the issue (see above, p.X ), reached the conclusion that even

though reforms in public administration may lead to a rise in public trust, there is an equal

chance that they will harm trust if it transpires that they were not planned properly, or that

they undermine the citizens' feeling of security. 104

5. Conclusions

Several general conclusions emerge from our study.

The first is that Israel is not unique in the low level of public trust in its national

parliament, since a similar phenomenon exists in most of the Western democratic states, and

even more so in the new democracies. Clearly this does not mitigate the gravity of the

negative phenomena that were uncovered in the Knesset Index, but it does place things in the

proper proportion.

The second is that there is no one explanation for the phenomenon of the decline of public

trust in government institutions in general, and parliaments in particular in the democratic

states, and therefore there is no one simply solution to the problem. This fact also affects the

prospect that reforms, introduced with the goal of improving the functioning of parliaments

and their image, will not necessarily bring a positive change in public trust in them. But even

though the reforms do not necessarily lead to an improvement in the level of trust, one should

not conclude that the introduction of reforms is a waste of time, but rather that one should not

develop exaggerated expectations from reforms, in so far as the level of trust is concerned.

103 Christensen & Lægreid (2003). 104 Van de Walle, Van Roosbrœk & Bouckært (2005). As to the operative conclusions of the writers, see appendix 3.

39

The third, which is based on the responses that we received from the Secretaries General

of 21 parliaments, is that parliamentary administrations perceive of the low trust in

parliaments primarily as a problem of information, of education, and of relations with the

media. They do not usually have a broader and deeper perception of the phenomenon, and

they are not aware of the vast quantity of information that has been gathered, and the deep

research that has been done in academic circles around the world.

The fourth is that it is might be useful to gather all the findings of studies that have

examined the issue of public trust in government institutions in general, and parliaments in

particular, and have proposed ways of dealing with the problem. We bring the conclusions of

two bodies that examined the issue: the Committee on Modernisation in the British House of

Commons (See Appendix No. 1), and a group of experts that prepared a report on the issue

for the OECD (See Appendix No. 3).

The fifth is that even if democracy might be endangered in several countries, lack of trust

or low trust in government institutions in general, and parliament in particular, do not

necessarily point to a general danger to democracy. On the contrary, it could very well be

that doubts and lack of trust are a positive phenomena, which express the essence and

immunity of liberal democracy.

7. Appendices Appendix No. 1 Conclusions and Recommendations of the Modernisation Select Committee in the House of Commons regarding connecting parliament with the public (published June 2004)105

Introduction 1. The House of Commons is the representative institution of the British people. It is here that our laws are made and it is from its Members that governments are formed. The sovereignty of Parliament is the fundamental expression of the sovereignty of the people. It is the apex of our democratic system. As such, it is very much a working place and at any time there are many thousands of passholders, in addition to 659 MPs and around 700 Peers. It is the purpose of this Report to make recommendations which will better reconcile the necessary purpose of Parliament with the reasonable expectation of the people to have access to the processes by which we govern ourselves (Paragraph 2) 2. It serves no-one if we make it difficult for voters to understand what their elected representatives are doing. Too often the impression is given that the House of Commons is a private club, run for the benefit of its Members, where members of the public are tolerated only on sufferance. It is beyond the influence of the House of Commons, let alone this Committee, to arrest international trends of declining participation and trust. However, the Commons can make itself more accessible to those outside, both as interested visitors and as citizens wishing to be more involved in proceedings, it can do more to make it easier for people to understand the work of Parliament, and it can do more to communicate its activity to the world outside (Paragraph 9) The Citizenship Curriculum 3. We recommend that Ministers in the Department for Education and Skills reexamine the balance of the citizenship curriculum because, while we recognise that the other matters covered by the curriculum such as the balance of rights and responsibilities and community involvement are crucial aspects of citizenship education, an understanding of the country’s democratic institutions is also of fundamental importance to today’s young people, and to the engaged voters of tomorrow (Paragraph 20) Educational resources at Westminster 4. We recommend that the House consider the provision of dedicated educational facilities for the use of the Education Unit, including a teaching area, as the National Assembly for Wales does (Paragraph 21) 5. We recommend that the Education Unit be given precedence in the Macmillan Room when the House is sitting in September (Paragraph 22) 6. We also think it would be desirable for the Central Tours Office to offer, in addition to its current tours, a Parliament-in-action Tour which would help visitors to understand how Parliament works and give them a brief taste of select committees, standing committees, adjournment debates and Westminster Hall as well as the Chamber (Paragraph 23) Outreach work with schools and colleges 7. Outreach work is the core of the Education Unit’s work, and rightly so. The vast majority of young people will not have the opportunity to participate in a school visit to Parliament, and Parliament’s educational activities must therefore be tailored to those who wish to learn about Parliament in the

105 House of Commons, Modernisation Select Committee (2004).

classroom. To supplement existing resources such as the website, outreach facilities such as a Parliamentary roadshow could have the potential to reach many more young people than currently are able to visit Parliament. We recommend that before any further consideration is given to establishing an educational roadshow, the House should examine the scope for a Parliamentary partnering scheme with, for example, local authorities. Parliament’s contribution to the teaching of political literacy could be delivered to people in their own communities (in schools, libraries and council premises) by way of joint enterprise (Paragraph 27) 8. The Education Unit already does a great deal of work building links with individual teachers, schools and colleges. We recommend that it should do more to publicise its work to Members, and to build links with local education authorities (Paragraph 28) Use of the Chamber 9. We believe there is a case for reconsideration of the long-standing convention that only elected Members of Parliament may ever sit in the Chamber, which is in contrast to the practice of many other legislatures (Paragraph 29) New Voters 10. We recommend that the House devise a new voter’s guide to be sent to all young people around the time of their eighteenth birthday (Paragraph 32) The Internet 11. We are convinced of the need for a radical upgrading of the website at an early opportunity, which will require significant investment in systems and staff. The financial implications of this are for the Finance and Services Committee and the House of Commons Commission to consider (Paragraph 50) 12. We recommend that the Broadcasting Committee keep under review the possibilities offered by the digital broadcasting of Parliament (Paragraph 52) On-line consultations 13. We believe that the greater use of on-line consultation is a good way for Parliament to take account of the views of the wider public (Paragraph 53) 14. There have now been several experiments with on-line consultation on an ad hoc basis, both by select committees and by all-party groups. They have generally been successful and have proved effective as a way of engaging members of the public in the work that we do and of giving a voice to those who would otherwise be excluded. We urge select committees and joint committees considering draft legislation to make on-line consultation a more regular aspect of their work (Paragraph 59) A Commons newsletter 15. We recommend that the House make available to those interested in receiving the information (by post, e-mail or other convenient method of communication) a weekly newsletter. Aimed at the general, non-specialist reader, it should summarise the business of the previous week and set out forthcoming business for the following week. In due course, it may be possible to extend this service to allow for communication of other information by e-mail (such as the daily list of papers available in the Vote Office) and regular, subject-based updates for which users could subscribe. A printed form of the newsletter should be made available to visitors at various points around the Parliamentary Estate, including the bookshop. Electronically, it should occupy a prominent position on or near the front page of the Parliamentary website (Paragraph 63) Information for young people 16. We recommend that, as development of the website progresses, the House authorities, in consultation with young people, develop the website in a form which is more accessible to them (Paragraph 65)

51

Visitors to the Parliamentary Estate 17. To the extent that there is conflict between the needs of different groups of visitors, we believe that the House should, as a matter of principle, give priority to the needs of those who come to see and participate in the work of Parliament over those whose primary interest is the Palace of Westminster as a historical building (Paragraph 66) A visitor centre 18. We welcome the work of the Administration and Accommodation and Works Committees and the House’s endorsement of the proposals for the construction of the reception and security building. (Paragraph 80) 19. We recognise the several unique difficulties involved in establishing new visitor facilities near the Palace of Westminster, but urge that all possible options are explored (Paragraph 81) 20. Our starting point is that any Visitor Centre project should have four main objectives: a) it must provide a welcome to visitors; b) it must provide an interesting and friendly environment; c) it should make Parliament more accessible, allowing visitors to see at least something of what Parliament is and does without necessarily having to visit the galleries, committees or take a tour; and d) it must improve public understanding and knowledge of the work and role of Parliament. The new reception and security building will help to meet the first of these objectives; it will use visitor staff so that visitors’ first contact with staff of the House will come from someone whose primary concern is to greet them and make them feel welcome. A major review of signage, currently underway, should also help to make the environment more welcoming. There may also be scope to improve the current facilities designed to meet the other three objectives but in our view the need for a dedicated Visitor Centre remains. Once the overdue improvement to Parliament’s welcome and access has been addressed, attention can focus on meeting the other three main objectives of the Visitor Centre Project through planning for a dedicated Visitor Centre (Paragraph 82) 21. Participants in the Hansard Society’s Connecting Communities with Parliament programme suggested a number of ways in which visitors’ experience of the Parliamentary Estate could be improved for a very modest cost. The main proposals were: a) More staff on-hand specifically to welcome visitors, tell them what they could see and point them in the right direction, handing them a written guide, perhaps including a plan and an indication of what visitors were able to do. b) A sign at the entrance saying ‘Welcome to the Houses of Parliament’. c) Better signage in general, indicating such things as toilets, the Jubilee Caf ,יthe Grand Committee Room, Committee Corridor, etc. d) Improved queuing systems for the Gallery. e) The possibility of a 'viewing gallery' which would allow visitors to pass along the corridor at the back of the Gallery, seeing the House while it is sitting but not stopping to listen to the debate. We welcome these practical suggestions and we commend them to the House authorities (Paragraph 85) 'Strangers'

52

22. We recommend that the term 'Strangers' be no longer used in referring to visitors to the House of Commons (Paragraph 86) Access to the Gallery when the House is sitting 23. We recommend that further consideration be given to ways in which groups of visitors touring the building might be able to pass through the gallery as part of a tour so that they are able to witness aspects of Parliament in action (Paragraph 89) Saturday opening 24. We recommend that the Administration Committee consider Saturday opening of the Line of Route – for Members’ parties as well as paying groups – to assess its feasibility (Paragraph 91) 25. We further recommend that the Administration Committee consider the feasibility of allowing Members to book guided tours of the Line of Route throughout the Summer opening on a similar basis to that on which they can book tours on sitting days (Paragraph 91) Standing committees 26. We recommend that the Procedure Committee consider how better to present the information from the bill, explanatory notes, amendment paper and selection list, either on paper or electronically, so that when an amendment is being debated Members and visitors can see the original clause, the clause as amended, and an explanatory note on both, so that the issue under debate is clear to all (Paragraph 94) 27. We recommend that a guide for visitors to standing committees on bills should also be produced (Paragraph 95) Public petitions 28. We believe that there is a case for the House to do more with public petitions which, if handled correctly, represent a potentially significant avenue for communication between the public and Parliament (Paragraph 99) 29. We recommend that the Liaison Committee and Procedure Committee consider a process whereby public petitions should automatically stand referred to the relevant select committee. It would then be for the committee to decide whether or not to conduct an inquiry into the issues raised, or to take them into account in the context of a current or forthcoming inquiry (Paragraph 100) Rules governing the submission of petitions 30. We recommend that the House accept petitions in both typescript and manuscript, although the present restriction against interlineations, deletions and insertions should be retained so that it is clear that the wording of the petition has not been changed without the petitioner’s knowledge. The top sheet – the authoritative copy of the petition – should continue to be distinguished from sheets of additional signatures by the Member presenting it signing in the top right-hand corner, as is the current practice (Paragraph 104) The House of Commons and the media 31. We welcome the progress that has been made in recent years to improve the House’s communications strategy, in particular the establishment of the posts of Communications Adviser and Media Adviser and the Select Committee Media Officers. The Group on Information for the Public has likewise played a vital role. But we believe that there is scope for greater co-ordination of the House’s media and communications resources. We therefore recommend the establishment of a central press office for the House of Commons, to take a more pro-active role in promoting the House and its work (Paragraph 121)

53

32. We recommend that the Board of Management and the House of Commons Commission urgently consider whether there is scope for further improving the coordination of the House’s media, educational and communications resources and planning, with effective Member oversight and close liaison with appropriate officials and Members of the House of Lords (Paragraph 122) Promoting Hansard 33. We recommend that the Department of the Official Report aim to produce a simple index to the daily part of Hansard once the necessary technological changes have been seen through (Paragraph 123) 34. We recommend that the Hansard report of a debate should be posted on the Internet at the same time as it is sent to the printer, to be replaced with the published version the following day (Paragraph 125) The Press Gallery 35. Consideration should be given to allowing journalists to bring laptop computers into the Press Gallery (Paragraph 126) Response of the House of Commons Commission to the First Report of the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of Commons, Connecting Parliament With the Public. First Special Report of Session 2004-05. Published on 2 December 2004. HC 69 A. Outreach Work with schools etc. (Recommendations 5, 7 and 8) The Commission has agreed to fund an additional staff post within the Education Unit, to focus on outreach to young people, as sought by the Committee. It is intended that a principal focus of the new post will be on building links with local education authorities. The Commission considers that the views of the House should be sought before any further consideration of an education roadshow, noting the estimate of the Board of Management that it might cost as much as £500,000 in capital costs, with full annual costs of over £300,000. A new voters' guide (Recommendation 10) The Commission has authorised more detailed exploration of the Committee's proposal for a new voters' guide to be sent to all young people around the time of their eighteenth birthday, so that a fully coasted proposal can be worked up. The Commission would not however authorise the production and distribution of such a guide without the prior approval of the House. A Commons newsletter (Recommendation 15) The commission has agreed in principle to the production and distribution electronically and, in limited numbers, in hard copy of a short newsletter summarising current House of Commons business in a readily accessible format, as recommended by the Committee, with a view to the first newsletter being available early in 2005. Media and communications (Recommendations 31 and 32) The Commission has agreed to fund modest additional staffing within the media and communications team, to enable the Communications Adviser to expand significantly the support provided for the Group on Information for the Public (GIP), and so to provide for the improved co-ordination of the House’s resources in this area recommended by the Committee. The Commission acknowledges the Committee's welcome of the steps it has taken in recent years to improve and expand media and communications services, primarily but not exclusively focussed on

54

promoting the work of select committees. Since the Committee reported, two further select committee media officers have begun work, so that all committees now have a call on this shared resource. The media and communications team is now co-located in 7 Millbank. The Commission believes that the House should be asked to express a view on the proposal for a 'central press office' set out in the Committee's Report. B. Visitors Reception and security building (Recommendations 18, 21(a) & 21 (d) The recommendations in relation to reception staff and queuing arrangements will be dealt with in planning for the new reception and security building, in conjunction with the appropriate domestic committees. Visitor Centre &c (Recommendations 4, 5, 19 & 20) The recommendations will be addressed in the development of plans for a Visitor Centre, in conjunction with the appropriate domestic committees. A number of options are being explored, and the four specific objectives identified by the Committee will be borne in mind by all those responsible. Given the pressures on space in the Estate, the best opportunity to provide dedicated educational facilities for the use of the Education Unit, as recommended by the Committee, would seem to lie in the proposed Visitor Centre. The Education Unit has priority booking over the Macmillan Room throughout the year, as recommended by the Committee (Recommendation 5). Visitors (Recommendations 21(b) & (c)) The major study of signage referred to in the Committee's Report has now been completed. There is already a welcome sign on the plasma screens at St. Stephen's Entrance and in Central Lobby. 'Strangers' (Recommendation 22) The Committee will be aware that the House decided on 26 October to remove the term 'strangers' from Standing orders. Advice has been sought from the appropriate domestic committees on the use of the term in other contexts, as referred to by the Committee in paragraph 86 of its Report. Parliament-in-action (Recommendations 6, 21(e) & 23) The Commission has noted the Committee's linked suggestions of a 'Parliament-in-action Tour' to help visitors understand how Parliament works and give them a brief taste of select and standing committees, Westminster Hall and the Camber: of a viewing gallery in the Chamber to enable visitors to see the House while sitting but not stop to listen to the debate: and for further study of ways to enable tours to pass through the gallery to witness the House in action. The proposed Visitor Centre will, as the Committee recommended, have as one of its primary objectives 'allowing visitors to see at least something of what Parliament is and does without necessarily having to visit the galleries, committees or take a tour' (paragraph 82). It will of course also continue to be possible for visitors to attend Westminster Hall debates, standing committees and public meetings of select committees, as well as the chamber itself. The Commission does not consider it feasible in the current security climate to contemplate tours passing through the gallery in the Chamber. Educational tours embracing brief visits to committees or Westminster Hall may be feasible. The Commission has also asked for further exploration of the possibility of extension of the current autumn visits programme run by the Education Unit to run all year round, and of the feasibility of a 'virtual' tour. Parliamentary Tour (Recommendations 24 & 25) Members can book guided tours of the visitor route on specified mornings throughout the period of the Summer Opening: 307 such tours were booked in the 2004 opening out of a possible 390 slots. The

55

prospect of Saturday opening of the Parliamentary Tour for Members' parties as well as paying groups is being examined in detail, and the matter will come to the Administration Committee soon. There are some serious practical issues to be resolved. The proposal would also require the support of the authorities in the House of Lords. C. Publications, website, &c Website (Recommendations 11 & 16) The Committee's recommendation for a radical upgrading of the website is already receiving attention. In recent months there have been a number of improvements in the site's content and organisation, including the introduction of webcasting. More extensive changes are being planned for, as part of the second phase of the Parliamentary Information Management Services (PIMS) project and the third phase of the Web Centre project. A business case will be prepared for the development of external access to PIMS, which would then become the primary means of providing public access to parliamentary information. The Commission expects to be considering this issue in the first half of 2005. Research will be commissioned shortly on how the website could be better designed to reach out to target audiences, and in particular to be more accessible to young people, as the Committee recommended. Hansard (Recommendations 33 & 34) The Commission has authorised the publication on the Internet of the Hansard report of proceedings in the Chamber throughout the day, as and when the final version is sent to the printer, as recommended by the Committee. A simple index to the hansard daily part will be produced by autumn 2005 as part of an existing project to bring the pagination process in-House; such an index is already provided for the internet version.

Divergences in the Results of Public Opinion Surveys

On p. X above we mentioned that there is an enormous gap between the findings of the

Knesset Index and the findings of the European Social Survey regarding the level of public

trust in the Knesset. The reason for the gap is mainly methodological. The ESS survey

enabled those surveyed to chose among 11 possible answers, from total lack of trust (0) to

absolute trust (10). The result, regarding Israel (IL) - 4.7 - is, at least on the face of it, much

higher than that found by the Knesset Index .

The figure for Israel in the ESS survey was calculated on the basis of the following data:

Table No. 16: Trust of the Israeli public in the Knesset according to the ESS survey of 2002 – rate of those answering in each category, in percentages

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12.2 5.7 7.5 9.7 9.7 17.9 9.9 10.5 8.2 3.9 4.9 Source: Prof. Noah Levin-Epstein, Tel-Aviv University.

For the Knesset Index the “Dahaf” Institute used a questionnaire worded by Prof. Yohanan

Peres and Prof. Ephraim Yaar-Yuchtman,106 which enables the interviewees to choose among

five possibilities – “there is full trust”, “there is trust”, “there is some trust”, “there is barely

any trust”, and “there is no trust”. In the final figure regarding trust in the Knesset only the

two first categories appeared, totaling 14%.

findings of a survey prepared by the Credit Suisse Bank regarding Switzerland. According to

the ESS survey trust in the Swiss Nationalrat stood at 5.8 – in fourth place after Denmark,

Sweden, and Finland (See figure No. 3 on p. X). According to the figures of the Credit

Suisse, which were sent to us by the Deputy Secretary General of the Nationalrat, in 2003

only 30% of those asked expressed trust in the Lower House and only 29% expressed trust in

106 Peres & Yaar-Yuchtman (1998), p. 245.

57

the Upper House. An examination of the full survey that was published by the bank (See

figure No. 4) explains the apparent discrepancy between the ESS data and the bank’s data.

The bank divided possible answers into three: much trust, some trust, and lack of trust. The

data sent us included only those that chose the first answer – much trust – but 63% of those

who answered expressed much trust or some trust in the Lower House, and 65% expressed

much trust or some trust in the Upper House.

Figure No. 4: Public trust in government institutions in Switzerland (2003).

The effect of different methods of dividing up the answers is also apparent when we compare

the data of the Eurobarometer regarding public trust in parliaments, to the data of the ESS on

the one hand, and of the European Value Survey on the other.

As mentioned above (p. X), in the ESS survey there were 11 possible answers. The

Eurobarometer surveys enabled the interviewees to choose between two answers only:

“inclined to trust”, and “inclined not to trust”. There is no room for nuances. Despite the

difference in the questionnaires, the results of the two surveys in 2002 are generally similar

(See table No. 18). The explanation for this is that in both surveys the division into positive

answers and negative answers is clear.

On the other hand, if one compares the data of the Eurobarometer to those of the World Value

59

The absence of convergence results from the fact that in the Eurobarometer questionnaire the

division into positive and negative answers is clear, while in the WVS survey there are four

possible answers – “a great deal of trust”, “quite a lot of trust”, “not much trust”, and “no

trust” – and in the data for those who expressed trust were included only those who chose the

first two options; among those who chose the “not much trust” option there might be some of

those who according to the Eurobarometer questionnaire were included in the category of

those inclined to trust.

The professional literature deals with the problem of possible responses. The scholarrs

Timothy Cook and Paul Gronke examined the issue of questionnaires and possible answers

with regards to two well known public opinion survey institutes in the United States: the

National Election Studies and the General Social Survey, both of which publish series of

surveys dealing with public trust in Government and in government institutions, starting in

the 1950s and 1960s. The data, which the two publish do not corroborate. The scholars argue

that the two institutes are inclined to include among the negative answers, answers that are

ambivalent, but strengthen the impression regarding lack of trust and lack of satisfaction.107

Appendix No. 3

Conclusions from background material prepared by Steven Van de Walle, Steven Van Roosbrœk & Gert Bouckært on trust in the Public Sector for the OECD108

Executive Summary This document analyses citizens’ trust in the public sector in the OECD countries. It summarizes available opinion data about trust in the civil service, and compares levels of trust between countries and institutions. Trust in government and in the public sector: assumptions and contingencies

1. Government should not strive for maximal trust, but for an optimal level of trust. 2. This optimal level of citizen trust in government is contingent upon the political and administrative culture of a country, and may thus be different in different countries.

3. A certain level of distrust in government is healthy and may be functional because it serves as a guarantee for accountability. In fact, balance of power and audit are institutionalised expressions of distrust.

4. A certain level of citizen distrust in the civil service may be functional for public sector reforms. Levels of trust in government and in the public sector

5. Despite assertions that there is a constant decline in citizens’ trust in the public sector, there

often are no suitable time-series data for supporting these statements. 6. In most countries, there is no solid evidence of a general decline of trust in political and administrative institutions, and there are significant fluctuations. 7. In many countries, the civil service is by no means the least trusted institution. 8. Despite many claims about changes in trust in the public sector or about citizens’ preferences, empirical data supporting these claims does often not exist, is unreliable, or even contradicts this popular wisdom.

9. General statements about levels of trust in institutions ignore the wide diversity between countries and institutions.

10. Trust in the public sector is embedded in deeper citizen-state relationships. Changes in trust can therefore only be interpreted taking differences in administrative cultures and in citizens’ expectations into account. Public sector performance and trust

11. There is no evidence of a direct causal link between the performance of government, and citizens’ trust in government. 12. The accumulated evidence in OECD countries suggests that trust in a cause, precondition and consequence of reform. A well-functioning public sector is necessary, but in itself insufficient for building trust in the public sector.

108 Van de Walle, Van Roosbrœk & Bouckært (2005)

61

13. Trust should be part of public sector reform objectives and strategies.

14. Erosion of public trust may follow from ill-designed public sector reforms. Executive implications Trust-building measures

15. Different citizen expectations vis-à-vis government in OECD member countries imply that a uniform strategy for building trust or for reforming the public sector may not exist. 16. Pro-active strategies may be needed towards groups of citizens with extremely low levels of trust. 17. Trust-building measures include strategies at all levels: concrete service delivery, the broad sector policy, and strengthening core state institutions. 18. Improving service delivery quality alone is not sufficient. Specific trust management strategies need to focus on how this quality is perceived by citizens (perception management), and efforts need to be made to bring actual service delivery in line with citizens’ expectations and vice-versa (expectation management). Trust-sustaining measures

19. Trust is a permanent concern. Governments need to be pro-active rather than just react when there is a crisis. Sustained political interest in the functioning and perception of public services is the best strategy.

20. Absence of distrust is no reason to neglect public services. Nurturing the trust capital already

present in the public sector is a much more effective and cheaper strategy than attempting to restore trust after years of neglect or after a crisis. Once lost, trust may be hard to restore.
