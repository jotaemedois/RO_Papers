rust is not a hot quality of government variable. It belongs to the family but it is a distant

cousin at most. Trust is more of a prerequisite or facilitating factor further back in the funnel

of causality than an operative QoG variable closely impacting different societal outcomes.

But even if trust is a distant causal factor in the background it should not be underestimated. Its

importance derives from the fact that trust supposedly lowers all forms of transaction costs in a society.

Most things become more efficient and take less time in a society where people trust each other and

trust leading institutions (Luhmann 1989, Misztal 1996, Holmberg 1999). Consequently, trust up to an

undefined level is grease not gravel in a society. Suspicion is harmful, but so is in all likelihood blind

faith too. Trust on a “lagom” high level is best. And it should preferably be based more on knowledge

and evaluative cognitions than on affects and preconceived notions.

T

Trust comes in all different forms (Bouckaert and van de Walle 2003). In our case the focus will be on

trust in parliament. If we have to pick just one type of institutional trust, confidence in parliament is a

rather obvious choice. Parliaments are – or should at least be - a central decision making institution in

all (democratic) systems (O´Brien, Stapenhurst and Johnston 2008). Parliaments are rule makers and if

you do not have faith in the rule maker it is difficult to live by the rules. Hence, trust in parliament is

probably more important for the functioning of a society than trust in many other institutions (Rolef

2006).

Empirical political science research has since long realized the importance of trust in parliaments.

Few other trust objects have been so extensively measured across time and across national systems as

trust in parliament (Bratton et al 2005, Brothén 2008). Trust in parliament can also be viewed as a

proxy for generalized confidence in one’s own country’s political system and/or democratic regime.

In our case, we will rely on data from the World Value Surveys collected in the years 1999-2002 for

some seventy countries.

The potential importance of trust in parliament for good and desirable societal outcomes can be tested

in many different areas. I have chosen to do a fairly extensive and broad examination involving some

twenty different outcome areas; from health and ecological outcomes to economic and social outcomes.

Two softer but not less relevant feel good outcomes are also included – the extent to which people feel

happy and are satisfied with their lives.

Trust in Parliament Rank Ordered Across Different Countries

Measuring political trust in the WVS studies entails a special problem in authoritarian and non democratic systems. People are not free to speak their mind or might be afraid to be overtly critical of

government institutions. It is probably easier to express low trust in parliament in United Kingdom than

2

in China or Pakistan. Consequently, the validity of the trust results from many authoritarian countries

could be put in question. In many instances we suspect that trust estimates will be too high.

In order to be able to control for this problem all of our analyses will be conducted

two ways – first among all cases, including non-democratic nations, and second only among European

and OECD countries where authoritarian regimes are less prevalent and where the quality of survey

research results are more reliable.

In Table 1 all seventy six countries who took part in WVS 1999-2002 are rank ordered according to

the percentage of their citizens who express trust in the national parliament. At the top we find nations

where high proportions of the citizenry express trust. Toward the bottom are countries where people

have less confidence in their parliament.

[Table 1 about here]

Our suspicion that authoritarian countries would exhibit not believable high levels of parliamentary

trust is vindicated by the results. At the top of the rank order in Table 1 we find countries such as

Vietnam, China, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Uganda and Pakistan; all of them with more than 75 percent of

their citizens “volunteering” a high degree of confidence in the parliament. In the extreme cases of

Vietnam and China the proportion of people supposedly trusting the parliament is 97 and 95 percent,

respectively. Obviously, these are not trustworthy results.

The first democratic countries on the list appear on rank eight and ten with about 70 per cent of their

citizens trusting the parliament. These most high ranking nations with believable estimates are Iceland

and Norway.

At the bottom of the list we find countries like Macedonia, Peru, Lithuania, South Korea and

Argentina with only between 7 and 11 percent of their citizens expressing confidence in the parliament.

As these results reveal, we can not complain about a lack of variance in the trust variable. Variability

can not be much better than from a high of 97 percent (Vietnam), alternatively 72 percent (Iceland), to

a low of 7 percent (Macedonia).

In Table 2 many of the authoritarian countries with less trustworthy survey results are excluded. Now

the rank order is restricted to forty five countries with higher quality in survey research and more

credible results. Most non-democratic regimes are not present anymore. The trust list is now headed by

a couple of small countries in Northern Europe – Iceland, Norway, Luxembourg and The Netherlands.

United States is found on rank nineteen with United Kingdom in place twenty three. Russia is placed

toward the bottom on rank forty. Lowest ranked is Lithuania, followed by South Korea and Czech

3

Republic. Among the low ranked is also New Zealand; a bit surprising or maybe we have discovered a

measurement error?

[Table 2 about here]

Potential Trust Effects

Given these rank orders in institutional trust across some seventy nations in total or across forty five

countries with believable survey results, the interesting question becomes what kind of relationships

there are between trust in parliament and a set of different societal outcome variables. The chosen

outcome variables are about twenty and they represent a wide variety of areas from health and ecology

to economics and social welfare. With one or two exceptions the normatively desirable outcomes is in

most cases pretty unequivocal. Most of us agree that good health, low infant mortality, improved

drinking water, low carbon emissions, high GDP per capita and a high Human Development Index

rating are positive things. The opposite with bad health, dying infants, fouled water, lots of CO2 emissions and on average poor people with low HDI scores is worse. This is clearly more negative

outcomes.

However, for some of our outcome variables agreement on what is the most desirable outcome is less

obvious. Should a society be characterized by equality or inequality, low or somewhat higher

unemployment levels, generous or less generous welfare provisions? Being a Swede I have opted for

the Swedish solution. In the analysis I have classified high equality, low unemployment and generous

welfare benefits as something positive for a society. And I have as well defined as positive feel good

outcomes like many people being subjectively happy and satisfied with their lives. Only misanthropes

think unhappiness is preferable to happiness.

Our study should be seen as a first rather crude benchmark. We restrict the investigation to a series of

bivariate correlational and regression analyses with trust in parliament defined as the independent

variable and the different outcome variables as the dependent variables. This is a rather original way of

analyzing trust in parliament. In most other research on the subject trust in parliament is treated as a

dependent variable, something to explain. And in that kind of research many of our societal outcomes

are defined as independent explanatory variables (Hibbing and Pattersson 1994).

In most cases I would think this to be the most sensible way of studying the subject. If trust and

outcomes are related, the most likely causal flow would probably originate and stem from the outcome

side, not from the trust side. Peoples´ perceptions of different forms of performance and outcomes

impinge on trust more than trust and resulting lowered transaction costs have an effect on outcomes.

4

But even if - in the interplay between trust and outcomes - the former plays the minor role, it can have

an independent role. Trust is not only a reflection of outcomes in society. To a degree, trust is also an

active agent of its one. At least, that is the hypothesis that we will entertain in this paper.

The results in the form of simple bivariat correlation coefficients and whether the potential effects of

trust are positive or negative on the outcome variables are presented in Table 3. The direction of the

effects (positive or negative) is determined by the leaning of the estimated regression lines. Two sets of

results are presented in the table – one for all seventy six cases and a second for the limited number of

forty five mostly European and OECD countries.

[Table 3 about here]

We can start by looking at the results from the analysis involving all countries, including many non democratic ones with dubious results when it comes to trust in parliament. Our hypothesis is to find at

least medium sized correlations, and what we have defined as positive relations between trust in

parliament and the outcome variables. Given this expectation, the results are a disappointment. A

majority of the relationships are non-existent or have the wrong direction – potential effects are

negative instead of positive. This is the case for no more than sixteen of our twenty two analyzed

relationships.

For example, in the full data set, high trust in parliament is related to short life expectancy, high

infant mortality, bad water quality and low HDI scores. Hence, a conclusion could be that countries

where people trust their parliament tend to be countries where life is pretty miserable. But that would

be a wrongful conclusion. And the reason is that the measurement of trust is unreliable in many mostly

authoritarian countries.

When these countries with questionable measurements of trust in parliament are excluded the results

look quite different and much more in accordance with what we expect. Now very few relationships are

non-existent or negative (only three). Most potential effects are positive (nineteen) and some

relationships indicate a respectable strength with correlations around .60. When we restrict the analysis

to countries with trustworthy measures of trust in parliament it is very clear that the trust variable has a

potential positive effect on many desirable societal outcomes. For instance, rather strong effects are

found for outcomes like long life expectancy, sustainable environment, improved drinking water, high

GDP per capita, generous social benefits and subjective feelings of happiness.

The deviant cases where the relationships are non-existent or very weak or even negative are of course

of a special interest. They indicate instances where the trust variable is irrelevant or where it has been

overrun by other more potent variables. There are two outcomes with negative relationships with trust

5

in parliament – carbon emissions and GDP growth. Countries with high trust in parliament tend to emit

more CO2 and to have a somewhat lower economic growth rate than nations with less trusting

populations. However, the conclusion from these results should not be that trust in parliament somehow

is a causal agent here, indirectly causing high carbon emissions and slow economic growth. A more

accurate model would relegate the trust variable to a less prominent place in the background with

spurious effects and highlight other causal factors having to do with, for example, production systems

and the development of the economy. People trusting their parliament is not to be blamed.

Trust in Parliament Matters

If we only see through all the bad measurements of trust in many authoritarian systems, our simple

benchmark study clearly indicates that trust in parliament matters for a whole host of desirable societal

outcomes and for the good society. But, of course, this is only the beginning. Now comes the task of

making the model more complicated by introducing additional variables and test whether trust in

parliament truly has any independent effects after we have controlled for other potential causal

variables.

That is, however, an assignment for another day and for another paper. For now, we can appreciate

that trust in parliament in most cases dances with the angels. When we started the analysis by looking

at the results based on all available WVS data – including data from many authoritarian countries with

dubious surveys – it first looked like trust in parliament danced with someone else. But now we know

better. Trust in parliament matters on the positive side.

Comment: Results come from the QoG data bank and WVS 1999 – 2002. Trust in parliament is seen as a QoG variable. “Effect of QoG” indicates whether trust in parliament is positively or negatively related to a “good” outcome in the societal outcome variables. The set of European and OECD countries include countries with more reliable and trustworthy survey research; countries where the trust in parliament results are plausible. n = number of countries.
