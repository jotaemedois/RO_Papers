Italy was the first European country to be affected by the Covid-19. To limit the

contagion, an emergency protocol was triggered on March 10, 2020, which imposed

a lockdown for 69 days. Many Italians considered the restrictions imposed by the

government excessive and unnecessary. We hypothesized that agreement with gov ernment restrictions and compliance with imposed rules was positively correlated

with trust in institutions, civic engagement, and the sense of community. To this end,

during the lockdown period, we administered an online questionnaire to 189 Sicilians.

The results showed that trust in institutional organizations and the attitude compo nent of civic engagement facilitate the approval of limitations imposed during the

lockdown period and the acceptance of future restrictions. Unexpectedly, the

behavioral component of civic engagement leads to the rejection of restrictions and

behaviors that could contain a further spread of the virus. Indeed, participants who

declared that they were engaged in beneficial actions for their community dis approved of the measures already adopted and were unwilling to adopt future

behaviors to limit the spread of the virus.

1 | INTRODUCTION

On 12 February 2020, the first case of Covid-19 was officially

diagnosed in Italy, and only one day later, an older man died of the

virus. In a few days, the number of infections increased, and Italy

became the first Western country to manage the Covid-19 pandemic.

The government decided on an emergency protocol that, from

10 March to 18 May, imposed restrictions on free movement and the

closure of almost all production activities. During the Covid-19 emer gency Italians' confidence in the government and the health system

grew (Scavo, 2020). Altruistic behaviors have also increased; indeed,

donations to the health system increased by about 30% compared to

previous years: more than 10 million Italians declared they had given

money at the beginning of the pandemic emergency and many others

declared their intention to do it soon (Castiglioni & Lozza, 2020).

During the lockdown period, most citizens observed the rules and

expressed solidarity behaviors; however, some behavior aimed to

challenge the rules decided by the authorities to protect public health

emerged. On social networks, more and more skeptics expressed dis trust of government decisions and contested the warnings of experts

and the information disseminated by the mass media about the sever ity of the virus and the number of deaths. One study found that peo ple who are less careful about protecting their health tend to have

less trust in health institutions and scientists' prescriptions and are

consequently less willing to work together to achieve a common pub lic health goal (Graffigna et al., 2020).

The lack of civic sense of citizens who contested and violated the

lockdown rules disappointed the majority of Italians (Ipsos, 2020),

who, however, over the months have become more pessimistic about

the financial consequences of the blocking measures, so much so that

concerns about current and future economic conditions have become

stronger than health concerns (Graffigna et al., 2021).

The conflicting behaviors and opinions of Italians led us to won der if attitudes towards the lockdown rules could be correlated with

the sense of community, institutional trust, and civic commitment.

The current scenario considers trust, civic commitment, and com munity care as tools for dealing with the emergency. Therefore, this

study aimed to verify whether thesense of community, trust in institu tions, and civic engagement could influence the acceptance and com pliance with the restrictions already approved by the government and

with other limitations that may be necessary for the future to counter

the Covid-19 pandemic.

1.1 | Civic engagement and sense of community

The social dimensions involved in the emergency caused by Covid-19

constitute the central elements of the concept of social capital.

Indeed, it has been defined as a cultural phenomenon that expresses

the civic duty, cohesion, and mutual trust that help a community over come problems through collective action (Putnam, 1993). Banfield

(1958) and Putnam (1993) highlighted a low social capital in the

southern regions, underlining the existence of a relationship between

institutional performance, cultural, economic, and political variables.

After many decades, the society and economy of the South of Italy

and Sicily have changed a lot, but the gap with the northern regions is

still very strong. Many authors agree that the southern ruling classes

are the main responsibility of this condition (Cartocci & Vanelli, 2015)

which limits the development of social capital and socio-economic

well-being of Sicilians.

Social capital, therefore, is based on trust (Fukuyama, 1995;

Raiser, 1999) and individual investment in social networks (Bourdieu,

1993; Durlauf & Fafchamps, 2005). It is regulated by reciprocity norms

(Coleman, 1988) and is complementary to formal institutions; indeed, it

contributes to strengthening democracy and increasing the social and

economic well-being of the community (Wallace et al., 2002). Social capi tal, therefore, is born and developed by investing in social relations and

civic engagement (Hyman, 2002; Lin, 2001).

Civic engagement consists of individual and collective actions

aimed at improving the conditions of one's community (Ehrlich, 1997).

It is expressed in many ways: by giving charity, engaging in

volunteering, participating and supporting democratic and political

movements, and so on (Adler & Goggin, 2005; DelliCarpini

et al., 2004). Therefore, it manifests itself in behaviors that refer to

the sense of community (Jacoby et al., 2009), social participation

(Lasker & Weiss, 2003), and active citizenship (Hoskins &

Mascherini, 2009). More specifically, civic engagement is a

multidimensional concept (Campagna et al., 2020) which includes:

political commitment (activities in support of representative democ racy; Ekman & Amnå, 2012); civil engagement (protests, strikes, par ticipation in human rights organizations, environmentalists, and so on;

Brady, 1999); community commitment (volunteering; Okun &

Michel, 2006) and civic commitment (respect for the environment and

animals, critical consumption choices; Gundelach, 2020).

The construct of civic engagement can be divided into two com ponents: civic attitudes, that is, values, ideas, and feelings that people

have about their involvement in their community, and civic behaviors,

that is, the concrete actions and responsibilities that individuals take

to improve their community (Doolittle & Faul, 2013).

The bond and interest in one's community are expressed through

the sense of community, which defines the feelings of belonging and

trust and the perception of similarity and interdependence between

people belonging to the same community (McMillan & Chavis, 1986;

Sarason, 1974;). Studies conducted in Italy reveal that the sense of

community contrasts feelings of loneliness (Prezza et al., 1999), pro motes social well-being (Cicognani et al., 2008), and the perception of

a better quality of life (Di Marco et al., 2020). Furthermore, belonging

to a community positively correlates with civic participation (Talò

et al., 2014) and with socio-political empowerment (Francescato

et al., 2007). Adolescents who are involved in their community

perceive less urban insecurity (Prezza & Pacilli, 2007), show greater

civic involvement (Albanesi et al., 2007), and more feelings of

empowerment (Cicognani et al., 2015). The sense of community

has been considered a cognitive component of civic engagement

(Underwood, 2017).

In this work, we considered the sense of community concerning

geographical belonging, the local community, and the interactions that

members develop with it (Heller, 1989). The community can also be

understood as a relational phenomenon. Belonging to a community

means sharing a history, language, religion, and so on (Gusfield, 1975).

In any case, the sense of community defines a system of voluntarily

maintained relationships and interdependence, making it possible to

express the needs for intimacy and belonging in a climate of shared

trust (Sarason, 1974).

1.2 | Institutional trust

Regarding trust, a distinction must be made between social trust and

institutional trust. Social trust, also called generalized trust, pertains to

an optimistic view of the world and promotes social interactions

between strangers based on the expectation that they are sincere and

do not want to harm others (Nannestad, 2008). Institutional trust, on

the other hand, is characterized by impersonality and expectation that

rulers, police, and public apparatuses in general, act at their best and for

the good of the community (Levi & Stoker, 2000). In social capital stud ies, the more established theoretical perspective states that civic

engagement promotes both social (Paxton, 2007) and institutional trust

(Sivesind et al., 2013). However, several studies show that social trust

often leads to civic participation and engagement (Bekkers, 2012;

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License

Dinesen, 2012); therefore, people who nourish a certain level of social

trust would be the most willing to help the community with their

voluntary work.

With regard to trust in institutions, it should be noted that it is

declining throughout the Western world (Ortiz-Ospina & Roser, 2016;

Rasmussen Global, 2018). As has been pointed out, trust is a fragile

and precious goods (Dasgupta, 1988) that requires a response mecha nism to trust that generates and sustains trust itself (Pettit, 1995), so

that if the citizen's expectations are disregarded, it tends to weaken

(Möllering, 2006).

The importance of reliable institutions for development, coopera tion, and social cohesion is widely recognized (Kumagai & Iorio, 2020;

Sztompka, 1999) because if the institutional apparatus is reliable, citi zens more easily comply with its demands (Fukuyama, 1995). How ever, so that institutional trust can exist, it is important that

institutional representatives are credible, that they know how to

design effective interventions and act in a non-arbitrary way

(Levi & Stoker, 2000). In general, it seems that reliability has five

components: competence, integrity, performance, accuracy, and

relevance of the information provided (Kavanagh et al., 2020).

These five characteristics are more or less a priority depending on

the institutions considered; so, for example, perceived competence

and integrity are more important to rulers, while the accuracy and

relevance of the information provided are critical for trusting the

media. Furthermore, it has been found that scandals involving a

politician can negatively affect the trust that voters have in the

entire government and the political system (Bowler & Karp, 2004).

Even too strict laws and rules, that have not been properly negoti ated with public opinion, can damage trust in the political class

because citizens perceive government actions as intrusive and

oppressive (Pettit, 1995).

The current scenario, therefore, is characterized by the decline of

institutional trust by citizens, even if, at the same time, the objective

indicators show that services have improved in recent decades. What

has been called the “delivery paradox” (Coats & Passmore, 2008),

makes it clear that to maintain citizens' trust in institutions it is not

enough to improve public services (Van de Walle & Bouckaert, 2007),

but institutions must strive to build a model of trust inspired by social

coordination that works to ensure responsible citizen collaboration

and not mere compliance (Brown, 2020). This new model of

interdependent trust assumes that the citizen is recognized as an

active partner in the relationship and that he or she feels respected

and recognized as a competent subject (Brown, 2020). After all, it

should be noted that the average citizen is less and less similar to the

“traditional” citizen who passively relied on experts and authorities

(Hanlon et al., 2006). For example, as regards the management of his

own health, he is increasingly informed and competent, and therefore,

he is also more suspicious and less willing to accept the opinion of an

expert without having compared it with other opinions and also hav ing verified it through the means that technology makes available

(Hanlon et al., 2006).

The relationship between institutional trust and emergency

appears complex. Crises and their impact on quality of life reduce

citizens' institutional trust (Miller & Listhaug, 1999; Polavieja, 2013).

Consequently, people ignore government-imposed rules and social

norms if they consider politicians' decisions inadequate (Roth

et al., 2011; Torcal, 2014). Furthermore, concerning the relationship

between institutional trust and civic engagement, it emerged that as

trust in parliament increases, participation in volunteering decreases

(Hackl et al., 2009), and that the choice to engage in volunteering can

be favored by mistrust in institutions that have not been able to solve

specific community problems (Eliasoph, 1998).

The delicate balance between institutional trust, politicians' credi bility, and crises enhances the probability that many citizens are criti cal regarding institutions' behavior. In Italy, as in other countries, there

is a constant decline in trust in institutions (OECD, 2017). A survey

conducted in 2019 (before the pandemic) showed that trust in institu tions has dwarfed public and political organizations, except the Pope

(Demos, 2019); moreover, a specific study on political institutions

shows that Italians have little faith in parties, parliament, and the gov ernment (Bergman et al., 2021). After all, since the 1990s the country

has been the scene of great political scandals (Pardo, 2004) and

numerous cases of corruption which, by violating the democratic con tract, have partly compromised citizens' trust in the political system

(Memoli, 2011; Pardo, 2018). In addition to these serious episodes,

citizens have been disappointed by many unfulfilled promises of

reforms (Bertsou, 2019) and by the credibility of an important part

of national journalism which, in recent years, appears not very inde pendent from political power (Calabresi, 2015). To prevent corruption,

facilitate citizens' participation in public decisions, and consolidate the

legitimacy of the authorities, legislative measures have been enacted

to achieve administrative transparency (Holzner & Holzner, 2006).

Overall, the results are positive (Galli et al., 2017), even if the pro cess is partly held back by bureaucracy (Di Mascio et al., 2019), reg ulatory incompleteness (Nugnes, 2019), and some resistance. A

recent study, for example, conducted within the national health

system, finds that only a minority of the involved bodies have dis closed social reporting reports useful for understanding their con tribution to SDG3 (Sustainable Development Goals 3, United

Nation, 2015) in a transparent way and that public managers are

less likely to adopt non-financial reporting tools than private ones

(Pizzi et al., 2020). Non-financial reporting is a strategic document

that goes beyond the communication of economic results and

allows citizens to understand if the activities of companies and

institutions are oriented towards social and environmental respon sibility (Dillard & Vinnari, 2019). It is therefore an excellent tool for

dialoguing and building trust between institutions and citizens

(La Torre et al., 2020).

The decline of trust in institutions, the severe restrictions

imposed by the government and those announced for the future, the

damage suffered by the national economy, and the high number of

deaths registered in Italy despite the lockdown could lead to a severe

worsening of institutional distrust. This distrust could push citizens

not to follow the rules imposed by the institutions to counter the

spread of the virus (for example, using a Smartphone application to

monitor infections, massive vaccinations).

2 | HYPOTHESES

Considering the theoretical framework outlined from the literature

presented in the introduction, our study aimed to investigate how the

sense of community, civic engagement, and trust in institutions corre lated with the attitudes towards anti-Covid measures imposed by the

government and those the people would adopt.

In particular, we assumed that:

H1: the sense of community, civic engagement, and trust in insti tutions should positively correlate with the attitudes towards anti Covid measures imposed by the government.

H2: the sense of community, civic engagement, and trust in insti tutions should positively correlate with the attitudes towards anti Covid measures that people would adopt.

3 | METHOD

3.1 | Participants and procedure

Participants were 189 Sicilians (146 female and 43 male), aged

between 18 and 75 years (Mean = 42.52, S.D. = 13.56), recruited

through an online questionnaire administered during the Coronavirus

lockdown. Participants had the following educational level: 9.5%

middle school, 31.7% high school diploma, 48.1%degree, and 10.6%

doctorate/specialization.

All participants were asked to indicate the level (none, indirect –

i.e., support with small donations or by disseminating initiatives on

social networks – and active – i.e., regular participation in activi ties) of involvement in 13 types of associations proposed

(e.g., social, religious, and political): 67.2% of the sample shows

no involvement; 25.9% indirect involvement, and 6.9% active

involvement.

All participants were informed that their responses would remain

private.

4 | MEASURES

4.1 | Sense of community

To measure sense of community 12 items derived from the Sense

of Community Scale (Prezza et al., 1999) were used (see also, Di

Marco et al., 2020). The items reflect three factors: attachment

(3 items, e.g., “I feel I belong to this community”), social relations

(6 items, e.g., “People in this community are kind and courteous”),

and satisfaction of needs and influence (3 items, e.g., “This com munity offers me the opportunity to do many things”). Participants

were asked to express their opinion on a 4-point scale ranging

from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The reliability was

satisfactory for all factors (alphas for attachment, satisfaction of

needs and influence, and social relations were respectively 0.821,

0.725, and 0.650.

4.2 | Civic engagement

To assess civic engagement, the Civic Engagement Scale (Doolittle &

Faul, 2013) was used. The items reflect two factors: civic attitudes

(8 items, e.g., “I feel responsible for my community”) and civic behav iors (6 items, e.g., “I am permanently involved in volunteering for the

community”). Participants were asked to express their opinion on a

7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

The reliability of civic attitudes and civic behaviors was respectively

0.867 and 0.890.

4.3 | Trust in institutions

Participants were asked to what extent they trust 10 public institu tions or organizations (e.g., “Health system,” “National political sys tem”; see World Value Survey, 2006). Participants were asked to

express their opinion about public institutions on a 5-point scale rang ing from 1 (not at all) to 4 (entirely). Alpha was 0.785.

4.4 | Anti-Covid measures imposed by the government

Participants were asked their opinion about eight anti-Covid measures

imposed by the government (e.g., “Wearing a mask in public places,”

“Ban on going out for personal reasons”). Participants were asked to

express their opinion on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (unnecessary

and harmful to the economy) to 4 (useful and necessary).Reliability

was 0.813.

4.5 | Anti-Covid measures people would adopt

Participants were asked about their availability to adopt nine personal

behaviors to limit the spread of the virus after the lockdown

(e.g., “Using Smartphone applications to monitor the spread of the

virus,” “Limiting personal travel unless strictly necessary”). For each

behavior, participants expressed their opinion on a 4-point scale rang ing from 1 (never, I am against in principle) to 4 (Yes, because I think it

is useful). Reliability was 0.773.

5 | RESULTS

Table 1 showed means, standard deviations, and correlations between

measures. Results indicate that trust in institutions was modest

(M = 2.44; S.D. = 0.51) and participants consider the anti-Covid mea sures imposed by the government to be adequate and appropriate

(M = 3.58; S.D. = 0.42); moreover, they show a favorable disposition

towards further limitations aimed at countering the spread of the virus

(anti-Covid measures people would adopt, M = 3.61; S.D. = 0.39).

The sense of community shows medium-low scores, highlighting a

certain consistency of social relationships (M = 2.80; S.D. = 0.55), a

moderate level of attachment (M = 2.63: S.D. = 0.68), and a modest

satisfaction of needs and influence (M = 2.41; S.D. = 0.64). The civic

sense of the participants appears well structured regarding attitudes

(M = 5.36: S.D. = 0.99) and slightly lacking regarding behavior

(M = 4.26; S.D. = 1.43).

Regarding correlation, anti-Covid measures imposed by the

government positively correlate with anti-Covid measures people

would adopt. Anti-Covid measures people would adopt positively

correlate with trust in institutions and with civic attitudes, while

anti-Covid measures imposed by the government only positively

correlate with trust in institutions. No correlation was found

between both anti-Covid measures and civic behavior and sense

of community. The three dimensions of sense of community

(attachment, social relations, and satisfaction of needs and influ ence) are positively correlated with civic attitudes, while civic

behaviors are only positively correlated with attachment and

social relations. Finally, trust in institutions is positively correlated

with all the variables investigated, except for civic behavior,

attachment, and satisfaction of needs and influence.

To test the effects of sense of community, civic engagement, and

trust in institutions on attitude towards anti-Covid measures imposed

by the government and anti-Covid measures people would adopt, we

ran a multiple regression with latent variables (LISREL 8; Jöreskog &

Sörbom, 1996-2001). To test the model, two aggregated indicators

were obtained for each variable by randomly splitting the respective

items (partial disaggregation model, Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994). The

testing of the model is reported in Figure 1. The model has a good

general fit: χ2 (76) = 109.72, p < 0.01; CFI = 0.98; SRMR = 0.041;

although χ2 was significant, CFI and SRMR satisfied the respective cri terion (see Hu & Bentler, 1999). Figure 1 shows that trust in institu tions is associated with a positive assessment of government-imposed

restrictions and those that may be adopted in the future, while civic

behaviors are negatively associated with them. Whereas, civic atti tudes are positively associated with both anti-Covid measures. The

sense of community (attachment, satisfaction of needs and influence,

and social relations) does not affect both kind anti-Covid measures.

6 | DISCUSSION

In this study, we tested the effects of sense of community, civic

engagement, and trust in institutions on attitudes towards anti-Covid

measures imposed by the government and those people would adopt.

Data collected show low levels of social capital; indeed, only a few

participants are actively involved in associations, trust in institutions is

low, sense of community is modest, and civic behaviors are not wide spread. The poverty of social capital in Sicily, as well as in other

regions of southern Italy, is not surprising (Putnam, 1993). Among the

causes of this developed scarcity are inequalities and conflicts that

have historically plagued Southern Italy (Albanese & de Blasio, 2018;

Boix & Posner, 1996; Mouritsen, 2003). The lack of share capital is,

consequently, also related to the economic backwardness which, at

present, does not tend to improve (Azevedo, 2015). There is a condi tion of recession in the Southern Italy that keeps the gap between the

southern and northern regions of Italy high (Svimez, 2019). In Sicily,

per capita income is among the lowest in the country and the inci dence of poor family is almost double the national average

(Istat, 2019). The causes of the irregular development of the South

and of the regional disparities that persist after 150 years of common

national history are complex and involve historical, cultural, geographi cal, and structural factors (Alfani & Sardone, 2015; Consoli &

Spagano, 2008; Fazio, 2003). According to many observers, however,

the role of institutions has been decisive, having behaved over time as

extractive institutions (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012) and having acted

to keep the economy and society of the South in a condition of “pas sive modernization” (Felice & Vasta, 2015). Formal institutions shape

economic growth and development (Aoki, 2001; Rodrik et al., 2004),

but also the quality of informal institutions, quality of life, and social

trust (European Commission, 2017). The bad management of the

southern regions by the institutions has contributed to lowering

the well-being of these regions (Ferrara & Nisticò, 2019).The South,

even today, has an insecure socio-economic climate, lacks infrastruc ture, and is less rich than the North (Nifo & Vecchione, 2015).

In this context, it is easier to find a culture that produces little

social capital, little collaboration, and a lot of social distrust (Bigoni

et al., 2016).

According to the model we tested, trust in institutions predicts

acceptance of government-imposed anti-covid measures and the

intention to adopt others in the future if necessary. Civic attitudes, on

the other hand, positively influence the intention to adopt cautions in

the future, but not those already imposed by the government. Proba bly, this result is connected with the different severity of the mea sures: the current ones, imposed during the health crisis, are rejected

because they have excessively limited personal freedom; future ones,

on the other hand, are accepted because they have lighter restrictions

that would allow people to go out, go to work, and so on.

The hypotheses that guided this work are confirmed with regards

to trust in institutions: it, indeed, is associated with compliance with

the provisions set by the government and with the adoption of those

that may be necessary for the future. On the other hand, the sense of

community does not affect attitudes in favor of restrictions, while

civic behaviors are associated with the rejection of current and future

measures.

7 | CONCLUSION

The results showed that trust in institutions predicts acceptance

of government-imposed anti-covid measures and the intention

of adopting others in the future if necessary. Results concerning civic

behaviors are in disagreement with the literature because people who

act for the well-being of their community should not reject the provi sions designed to protect the health of the community. This result

could express impatience with the solutions proposed by the govern ment because they are generalized and do not consider the territorial

needs of specific cities. Indeed, in the first wave of the pandemic, most

of the infections and deaths due to the Coronavirus were recorded in

Northern Italy, while in the South of Italy and Sicily the virus affected

much less (ISTAT, 2020). For this reason, the measures imposed are

judged inadequate.

More generally, it can be deduced that civic engagement (voluntary

and free response to the needs of the community) fosters feelings of

distrust towards institutions. They were unable to meet the needs of

the community. This hypothesis contrasts with the more consolidated

theoretical perspective affirming that participation in voluntary organi zations promotes social trust (Jennings & Stoker, 2004) and, thanks to

collaborative contacts with institutional representatives (Bjørnskov,

2009), institutional trust (Brehm & Rahn, 1997). However, it does not

contradict studies showing that social trust often drives people to

engage in volunteering and charitable organizations (van Ingen &

Bekkers, 2013). Consequently, civic behaviors persist even when there

is a lack of trust in institutions and their quality is considered poor

(Serritzlew et al., 2014). This is the circumstance that prefigures the

presence of “liberal distrust,” considered beneficial for democracy

because it allows citizens to express disapproval of public officials and

politicians (Bertsou, 2019). This attitude distinguishes the so-called crit ical citizens, who actively commit themselves to the community

because they have generalized trust but are disheartened by institu tions and politics (Norris, 1999). Furthermore, in a crisis, altruistic, and

supportive behaviors increase (Ipsos, 2020) and, when institutions are

exceptionally ineffective, social trust among citizens increases too

because this represents a coping strategy to face difficulties and uncer tainty (Ervasti et al., 2018). Furthermore, considering that, due to the

conditions outlined above, the relationship of trust between Sicilians

and institutions is historically fragile, the particular association between

civic commitment and negative attitudes to health provisions appears

more plausible. Overall, our results lead us to reflect on the decline in

trust of institutions, that deals with past and present circumstances: in

the past, we find the events of recent history (scandals, corruption,

inefficiency, etc.) that have weakened trust in institutions

(Memoli, 2011; Pardo, 2018); while, in the, we find modern citizens

who want to be recognized as active and competent partners

(Brown, 2020) to collaborate with decision-makers and not to passively

submit to their dispositions (Coats & Passmore, 2008). Reluctance to

collaborate with authorities to protect their own health and that of the

community indicates that people do not see themselves as active part ners in the health system (Graffigna et al., 2020) because they are war ier (Hanlon et al., 2006) towards institutions. Institutions, indeed, ask

citizens for trust but do not commit themselves to negotiate rules of

reciprocity with citizens (Mouritsen, 2003). It is therefore necessary

that policy makers promote deliberative governance processes to

strengthen the trust of the most active and committed citizens and

obtain their collaboration (Van de Walle & Bouckaert, 2007).

Overall, we believe that what has emerged from this work can

constitute an interesting stimulus to deepen the relationships that

exist between the components of social capital (sense of community,

trust, and civic commitment) and responsible behaviors useful for

protecting the community in crises. Furthermore, we need to under stand better the reasons that induce the most active members to

reject measures that can protect public health and understand the

social influence of their attitudes on the belonging community.

7.1 | Limitations and further investigations

The main limitation of this study is its correlational nature that is not

able to clarify the causal relationships between investigated variables.

Another limitation is the small size of the sample and its composition:

the participants are all Sicilian and their regional affiliation gives them

very specific characteristics, so the generalization of the results to

other contexts must be verified; moreover, only available respondents

were recruited, so the sample cannot be considered representative of

the Sicilian population and the data obtained may be affected by the

selection bias. Finally, in this study, we did not investigate effects of

social trust, which could have better explained the relationships

between the sense of community, civic engagement, and trust in

institutions. Further studies should use an experimental or longitudinal

design to establish a causal relationship between variables and use a

more heterogeneous and more representative sample of the popula tion. Moreover, the effects of social trust should be investigated.
