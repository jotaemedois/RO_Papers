Abstract

This article seeks to gain a deeper understanding on the relationship between polarisation and

political trust in multiparty systems by examining the effect of different indicators of

affective and ideological polarisation on the within-individual variation of political trust over

time. Using unique data collected from two separate online survey panels in Spain, our

findings show that in multiparty contexts it is important to use two different measures of

affective polarisation, as they have two distinct effects on political trust. While in-group

affective polarisation tends to increase political trust, out-group polarisation has a negative

impact on within-individual levels of trust in all democratic institutions. The latter effect is

much stronger, providing an explanation of the overall decline in political trust.

Trust in the institutions of representation, the legal system and main political actors

seems to be declining in many contemporary democracies. In explaining this phenomenon,

recent academic work has often emphasised the effect of “performance” evaluations,

adopting a “trust-as-evaluation” approach, according to which people trust institutions more

or less based on rational calculations of the perceived trustworthiness of each institution in

relation to its benchmarks (Van der Meer & Hakhverdian 2017). However, an important

aspect that has not been addressed is the effect of affective politics – and the inter-partisan

group conflict it generates – on this decline in political trust. Despite the burgeoning

literature, we still know relatively little about this topic, especially on the political

consequences of affective polarisation (Iyengar et al. 2019, p. 139). Only a limited number of

studies have made some general assessments about its impact on the quality of democracy

(McCoy & Somer 2019, pp. 258-60; Somer, McCoy & Luke 2021, pp. 932-4), and how it

might undermine certain democratic norms (Graham & Svolik 2020; Kingzette et al. 2021).

Our knowledge is much more limited on how affective polarisation might affect other

important democratic attitudes such as political trust. The most significant attempt to address

this topic is the ‘polarisation of political trust’ hypothesis (Hetherington & Rudolph 2015)

which has become a central part of the academic debate on explaining individual-level trust

in the government but has only been explored in the context of the United States. According

to this theory, political trust in the government varies depending on individual partisanship

which conditions how people look at and evaluate its performance, and that the overall

decline observed in trust can be attributed to increasing levels of affective confrontation

between the two main parties.

While enlightening for the US case, this contribution presents some significant

limitations in its ability to travel to other contexts, particularly to multiparty systems.

Affective polarisation in the US is shaped by the dynamics of a two-party system (Harteveld

4

2019, p. 3), making it very difficult to disentangle the effects of in-group polarisation from

out-group polarisation, as they are inverse concepts in this context (Theiss-Morse, Barton &

Wagner 2015, pp. 175-177). In the US, partisan identification produces rivalry between the

two groups (Miller & Conover 2015), strengthening the antipodal relationship between in group and out-group sentiments. This is not the case in multiparty systems. In these settings,

self-identification with a single party will often be smaller if multiple parties exist that are

ideologically close, affecting the level of partisan affective polarisation (Harteveld 2019).

Additionally, in many countries, party identification is lower in general, and, although

affective polarisation and partisanship might still be related (Wagner 2021), the effect of

positive in-group and negative out-group sentiments on political trust might be present

regardless of the levels of pure or instrumental partisanship (Huddy, Bankert & Davies 2018).

This is an important aspect to consider especially in systems with low levels of instrumental

partisanship and party system instability with high electoral volatility. Finally, most work on

this topic has focussed on the government as the object of trust (for an exception see, Theiss Morse, Barton & Wagner 2015, pp. 174-175), however the evaluation of ‘the government’ is

strongly related with opinions regarding the incumbent and party competition (Cinar & Ugur Cinar 2018). Thus, we are likely to overestimate the importance of the effect of ‘partisan

affect’ on political trust based solely on this political object. Therefore, there are still many

questions about this topic that require more detailed comparative research. Does this

phenomenon occur in multiparty settings? Does affective polarisation have the same effect on

other objects of political trust? Does in-group polarisation have the same effect as out-group

polarisation on political trust? Are these effects also present in contexts of low party

identification and increasing levels of party supply volatility?

In this article we argue that affective polarisation has a clear and strong impact on

individual-level variation in political trust over time, but that in multiparty systems the

5

direction of this effect is different depending on if polarisation stems from positive in-group

or negative out-group sentiments. In the case of the US, in-group affective polarisation

produced by positive in-group sentiments among members of the same political group

increases trust in the main institutions of democracy whereas out-group affective polarisation,

or negative sentiments toward voters and leaders of other political groups, decreases political

trust (Theiss-Morse, Barton & Wagner 2015). In the analyses to follow, however, we find

that in the multiparty setting of Spain, the negative effect of out-group affective polarisation

is substantially stronger than the positive effect of in-group affective polarisation, resulting in

an overall reduction of political trust. We find this to be true for all institutions at the national

and subnational levels, and that this tendency seems to hold regardless of the ideological

position of the parties that might cause polarisation, not just for right-wing populist parties

(Muis, Brils & Gaidytè 2021). As we will show, the effects of polarisation on political trust

seem to be the same in two different periods, one characterised by the emergence of a radical

left-wing populist party and the other by the emergence of a radical right-wing party. These

findings contribute to a better understanding of the effect of partisan affective polarisation on

political trust in multiparty settings.

In the following pages we test this argument using two original survey panel datasets.

One is the CIUPANEL dataset (Torcal, Martini & Serani 2016) which was collected between

2014 and 2015, coinciding with a period of increasing polarisation and the emergence of the

radical left-wing party, Podemos (We can). The second survey panel, E-DEM, was conducted

between October 2018 and May 2019 (Torcal et al. 2020). This period coincides with an

increase in affective polarisation attributed to certain events in contemporary Spanish politics,

including two elections and the increase in support for the extreme right-wing party Vox. This

dataset includes various individual-level measures of affective and ideological polarisation and

political trust repeated across multiple waves.

The Polarisation of Political Trust

Conceptually, political trust is an “indicator of support” (Zmerli, Newton & Montero

2007, p. 41) “concerned with the political institutions that link overarching democratic

principles to everyday actors and policies” (Van der Meer & Zmerli 2017, p. 4; see also

Newton & Norris 2000, p. 53). The study of this concept has gained momentum during the

last decade due to the fact that trust in the basic institutions of democratic representation and

aggregation of interests seems to be declining in many contemporary democracies (Torcal

2017; Van der Meer & Zmerli 2017).

Scholars have recently emphasised the role of performance evaluations in explaining

political trust, in what has become known as the “trust-as-evaluation” approach (Van der

Meer & Hakhverdian 2017). From this perspective, attention is directed towards aspects

related to the output side of the political system – that is it, whether the (democratic)

government is effective and performs well, ensuring wealth and affluence (Martini &

Quaranta 2020; Rothstein 2009). Economic stewardship and its social consequences are

typically identified as a leading cause of trust: when citizens are dissatisfied with economic

performance, distrust of government ensues, whereas the reverse effect is produced when

economic prosperity abounds (Citrin & Luks 2001; Kumlin 2004; Listhaug 2006; Rothstein

2003). Some authors have also attributed this process to welfare state retrenchment (Alesina

& Wacziarg 2000; Kumlin & Haugsgjerd 2017). Finally, in line with this, recent studies have

shown that fluctuations in economic performance affect levels of political trust over time

(Dotti Sani & Magistro 2016; Ruelens, Meuleman & Nicaise 2018;; Van Erkel & Van der

Meer 2016).

7

Alternatively, although following the same understanding of what explains political

trust, several studies argue that political institutions are increasingly unresponsive to citizens’

demands (Hakhverdian & Mayne 2012; Harteveld, Van de Meer & de Vries 2013; Norris

2011) and that the decrease in political trust is a symptom of perceived deficits in the

functioning of the political process (Pharr 2000). Some have argued that this decline could be

due to a lack of “institutional fairness”, measured either by subjective perceptions or

objective indicators (Grimes 2006; Hakhverdian & Mayne 2012; Kumlin 2004; Linde 2012;

Persson, Parker & Widmalm 2017; Van der Meer & Hakhverdian 2017). Others maintain that

it has more to do with perceptions regarding the lack of political responsiveness, which can

be defined as the short-term tension between what people want and what they receive from

political parties and leaders in terms of policies and policy outputs (Linde & Peters 2020, p.

291; see also Torcal 2014). Finally, another factor considered by the comparative literature

on the evolution of political trust-as-evaluation is the negative effect of political corruption

(Chang 2013;; Hakhverdian & Quinton 2012; Harring 2013; Uslaner 2017, Wang 2016).

Nevertheless, and despite the relevance of these contributions, one cannot consider political

trust as only the product of rational merit-based evaluations citizens have of these objects of

trust (Harteveld, Van de Meer & de Vries 2013). While it has not been extensively explored,

some studies suggest that these evaluations may be conditioned by ideological or party

preferences (Jones 2015). Scholarship has shown, for example, that the gap between winners

and losers (based on party preferences and election results) can make a difference in the

levels of satisfaction with democratic functioning and even political trust (Anderson et al.

2005; Singh 2013; Theiss-Morse, Barton & Wagner 2015), however it remains unclear the

extent to which holding polarised partisan positions matters for political trust.

In that respect, an important aspect that has not been fully addressed is the effect of

affective politics—and the inter-partisan group conflict it generates—on declining political

8

trust. Increasing partisan polarisation and the party dynamics that it generates can affect

political trust through different mechanisms. First, as it has been pointed out, an important

part of radical actors’ tactics is to attack representative institutions which, in turn, affects their

supporters’ attitudes. Most comparative literature has attributed these uncivil discourses to

ideologically radical parties and, more concretely, to those with populist discourses and

strategies (Mauk 2020). These parties are characterised by their tendency to unite criticisms

of established democratic procedures and institutions with critiques of political elites

(Galston 2018), accusing them of not caring about the common people, being unresponsive

and unaccountable to ordinary people’s demands, and of being incompetent (Mudde 2004;

Sheets, Bos & Boomgaarden 2016; Somer 2019; Tworzecki 2019). These populist messages

are bound to undermine citizens’ trust in the political system, as perceptions of

responsiveness, accountability, and competence are core components of trust in institutions of

representation (Muis, Brils & Gaidytè 2021).

However, there is reason to believe that the detrimental effects of partisan affective

polarisation should not only be attributed to populist or extremist parties. Not only are many

dynamics that turn polarisation pernicious built-in and hard to control for the very political

actors that initiate it, but more importantly, it is not always clear how other political actors

can respond to polarising parties “constructively” without getting into reactive polarizing

strategies (Klein 2020, pp.40-44; McCoy & Somer 2019, p. 257, Somer, McCoy & Luke

2021, pp. 936-7). As these authors claim, if politicians abstain from counter-polarisation, for

instance by not vilifying extreme radical parties, they may be seen as accepting and thus

legitimising the parties’ unscrupulous tactics and even the violation of accepted democratic

norms. This causes the other parties in the political system to implement their own polarising

tactics and malign their opponents, contributing to greater perceptions of polarisation than the

policy differences among parties actually warrant, and accelerating democratic erosion

9

(Somer 2019, p. 57; Vegetti 2019, p. 88-9). This dynamic seems to be most visible on social

media (Klein 2020, pp. 158 ff.); studies have shown, for example, that a high percentage of

tweets seem to contain very uncivil messages (Theocharis et al. 2020). Consequently, these

dynamics of party competition may produce declining evaluations of political institutions,

leading to the deterioration of trust in representative institutions and their main actors (parties

and politicians).

This erosion of citizens’ trust in their institutions and actors of representation could be

attributed to more factors beyond the uncivil messages adopted by political parties. Affective

polarisation increases zero-sum perceptions of the public space, reducing willingness to

cooperate and compromise in seeking solutions to shared predicaments. This produces

problems of governance: either gridlock—the inability to make and implement effective

policy decisions—or the unilateral imposition of policies by the majority on the minority

(Klein 2020, pp. 131-2; McCoy & Somer 2019, pp. 257-258). Additionally, these situations

might be exacerbated by aggressive discourses and behaviours adopted by most parties in an

attempt to delegitimise their opponents, leading voters to discount substantive information,

and to develop more confidence in “less substantively grounded opinions” (Druckman,

Peterson & Slothuss 2013, p. 73) causing them to choose their own party’s positions over

liberal democratic principles (Graham & Svolik 2020; Kingzette et al. 2021; Mauk 2020;

Svolik 2020). Therefore, these dynamics decrease evaluations of political institutions,

deteriorating trust in representative institutions and their main actors (parties and politicians).

However, in this context we need to take into consideration how in-group and out group polarisation may have different effects on trust, especially in multiparty systems where

polarisation due to out-group sentiments are not the exact mirror of in-group sentiments. In group polarisation might contribute to the increase of political trust among those having

positive feelings towards that particular partisan group, especially if that party is gaining

10

more support and more power in those institutions. This is precisely the logic used by

scholars who argue that the negative effects on political trust disappear or reverse when

populist or illiberal parties are in the government (Park 2017; Rivetti & Cavatorta 2017).

When those parties obtain an important number of seats in parliament or even control

institutions, their supporters may come to trust institutions more and stop questioning the

decisions and outcomes they produce, contributing positively to overall political trust (for a

recent counter-argument see; Muis, Brils & Gaidytè 2021). However, affective polarisation

leads to a greater questioning of the moral legitimacy of out-group political leaders and

voters. As Iyengar, Sood and Lelkes (2012, p. 428) note, those who impugn the motives and

character of political opponents are less likely to treat as legitimate the decisions and policies

enacted when those opponents control the government and may also be less satisfied with

representative institutions.

Based on the preceding discussion, we put forth the two following hypotheses:

H1. As in-group partisan affective polarisation increases over time, political trust should

increase.

H2. As out-group partisan affective polarisation increases over time, political trust should

decrease.

Data and the Model

Our data come from two different online survey panels. The first is the CIUPANEL

(Torcal, Martini & Serani 2016) consisting of a total of 3,686 respondents recruited from a

sample of adult citizens who completed six waves of an online panel conducted during 2014

and 2015.1 Unfortunately, we could only use two of the waves (third and fifth) given the

11

variables needed for this analysis. The second online survey panel is the E-DEM (Torcal et al.

2020), which includes 1,484 respondents selected from the Spanish voting-age population who

completed all four waves between October 2018 and May 2019 (for information on these two

survey panels, see Tables 1A to 4A in sections A of the Online Appendix).

About Political Trust

Political trust is defined by a specific “set of objects (political institutions and actors)

and is both relational (having a subject and an object) and situational (characterized by a

degree of uncertainty about the object’s future actions)” (Van der Meer & Zmerli 2017, p. 4).

Both survey panel datasets used here contain repeated individual-level information on a set of

indicators of trust in different institutions and political actors in Spain at the national and

regional levels (for wording and scales see sections B of the Online Appendix). Table 1

contains the average within-individual changes in political trust for various institutions across

the waves during the two different time periods under study. Although the figures are not

directly comparable across the survey panels due to slightly different ranges of the indicators,

we can observe that during the first period between 2014-5 there is a decrease in political

trust, but during the second (2018-9) there is a small but positive increase in political trust for

all institutions over the duration of the survey panel. Observing the changes between each

wave during this second period, the largest increase occurred between the first and second

wave (October 2018 to February 2019). This was the period of greatest electoral growth of

the radical right-wing party Vox and the highest aggregate increase in levels of affective

polarisation (Torcal & Comellas 2022).

(Table 1)

12

Measures of polarisation

To measure affective polarisation we have used sentiments towards voters and party

leaders according to Wagner’s formula (2021, pp. 4-5). Additionally, we use an indicator of

territorial affective polarisation in order to control for this orthogonal conflict that has been so

relevant in Spanish politics during the last years. By including this measure, we can test

whether this conflict contributes to the evolution of political trust in different institutions at

different levels of government, as has been argued in recent work on Spanish politics (Orriols

& León 2020, pp. 370-2) (see section B of the Online Appendix).

As has been discussed in the literature, there could be two other types of polarisation

that may cause individuals to adopt more extreme attitudes (Ward & Tavits 2019). As such,

we include an additional two measures of polarisation in the models: the individual perceived

party system polarisation (Alvarez & Nagler 2004, p. 50; Ezrow 2007, p. 186); and an

individual-level measure of ideological extremism measured as the distance between each

respondent’s left–right self-placement and some central position (Weldon & Dalton 2014),

which in our case is the average ideological position of our sample (see section B of the

Online Appendix).

How much individual-level variation can be observed in the different measures of

polarisation over time? Table 2 displays the longitudinal information for different indicators

of polarisation during the two time periods under study. During the first, there is a substantive

decrease in in-group polarisation, where the rest of the indicators seem to be relatively stable.

In general, we can say that the average change in individual-level affective polarisation

during these time periods has been small but varies depending on the type of polarisation.

13

(Table 2)

The model

To test our hypotheses, we estimate a longitudinal model with two-way fixed effects

(individual and time/waves). This model will allow us to test the effects of within-individual

variation of in-group and out-group partisan affective polarisation, territorial polarisation, and

the two measures of ideological polarisation on political trust. Additionally, in our models

we estimate the effects of the within-individual variation of two variables that have long been

used to explain political trust: evaluation of the country’s economic situation and perceptions

of corruption. To test the potential effects of changes in one’s economic and social

situations, we include in the model individual variation on an index of economic uncertainty

and subjective well-being. Finally, we add other control variables such as political interest,

social trust, and positions on some salient political and social issues in Spain (see section B of

the Online Appendix).

Thus, the model we estimate is the following:

𝑌𝑖𝑡= 𝛼𝑖𝑜+ 𝛽𝑖𝜏𝑖+ 𝛽𝑡𝛾𝑡+ 𝜇𝑖+ 𝜀𝑖𝑡

where 𝜏𝑖 is a vector of individual fixed effects (𝑥̅it-xi): in-group and out-group affective

polarisation, perceived ideological polarisation, ideological extremism, territorial polarisation

(only for the second time frame), political interest, economic evaluation, corruption

evaluation, government evaluation (only for the first time frame), issue positions on

decentralisation, public services, abortion wealth distribution and immigration (only for the

second time frame), and personal economic uncertainty index. 𝛾𝑡 is a vector of time/wave

14

dummies (waves 3 and 5). 𝜇𝑖 are the model’s (homogeneous) random effects for individuals

i, which are assumed to be normally distributed and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 are the model’s (homoscedastic)

individual-level residuals, which are also assumed to be normally distributed.

Results: the systematic negative effects of out-group polarisation

Table 3 displays the results of a longitudinal OLS model with two-way fixed effects

(individual and time/wave) based on the survey panel data for the period 2014-5 (two waves).

In this table we can observe the consistency of two important factors in explaining individual

variation of political trust: government evaluation and, more importantly, the consistent

negative effect of out-group partisan polarisation based on sentiments towards voters of

different parties (H2). However, the positive individual fixed effect of in-group polarisation

on political trust (H1) is not only substantially weaker, but it is also inconsistent depending on

the type of institutions (it is not significant, for example, for trust in politicians). Based on

these results, we can initially posit that the polarisation based on out-group dislike seems to

be consistently deteriorating political trust, a process that it is hardly compensated by the

benefits of in-group like.

To confirm these findings, we have repeated the same analysis for the survey panel

covering the 2018-9 period (three waves), during which polarisation was generated by the

emergence of a right-wing party (Vox) and political trust was already very deteriorated (see

Torcal 2021). For the estimation of these models, we have an additional dependent variable:

trust in the regional government. In the data for first period under study (2014-2015), we do

not have the indicators on issue positions nor an indicator of territorial affective polarisation

(see below). As such, for the models for those years we substituted these indicators with

15

government evaluation, as they tend to be highly correlated (for a detailed description on the

wording and summary statistics of each indicator see section B of the online Appendix).

Based on the results of the estimation of these models displayed in Tables 3 and 4, we

can conclude that there are four fundamental and consistent drivers of the within-individual

variation of political trust for all institutions: evaluation of the economic situation, evaluation

of political corruption, and in-group and out-group partisan affective polarisation based on

feelings toward leaders. Although it is not consistent for all institutions, results also confirm

previous findings that stress the positive relationship between economic performance and

political trust (Dotti Sani & Magistro 2016; Van Erkel & Van der Meer 2016), with this

effect mostly due to sociotropic evaluations and not so much to change in an individual’s

economic and social conditions (reflected in the null effect of the individual index of

economic security and well-being evaluation). The effect of perceptions regarding the level

of corruption on trust is positive and significant for the second time period (2018-9) showing

that the higher an individual’s perceptions of corruption, the greater the change in their levels

of political trust. This effect of corruption in the second period is likely due to greater

visibility in the public sphere of corruption scandals that dramatically affected political trust

(Torcal & Christmann 2021, p. 4 and p. 7), and confirms once again the importance of the

perception of corruption for explaining political trust (Della Porta 2000; Uslaner 2017).

However, what is more important for our argument is that these findings confirm that out group partisan affective polarisation based on sentiments towards party leaders presents a

larger negative impact on the within- variation of political trust, confirming H2, as well as the

reduced and inconsistent positive effects of in-group partisan polarisation (H1).

(Tables 3 and 4)

16

Additionally, it should be noted that ideological polarisation does not have a

consistent effect on the within-individual variation of political trust across different

institutions. This is also the case with ideological extremism, the effect for which is only

observed for trust in politicians and the regional government during the second time period.

In the same vein, it is also important to highlight that the variations in an individual’s

positions on the most salient issues at the moment have almost no effect on political trust.

Finally, in these results we find that territorial affective polarisation (only included in the

models for the period 2018-9) has limited effects (positive for regional governments and

small negative effects on trust in politicians) on political trust. Thus, out of all the

polarisation measures, only out-group partisan affective polarisation seems to have a

significant and consistent negative effect on political trust and the slight increase produced by

the positive effect of in-group partisan polarisation hardly compensates for its effect, a

finding very much in line with previous studies’ results regarding the negative effects of out group dislike (Lehr, Ferreira & Banaji 2019).

However, as it has been discussed in some literature on the US (Druckman &

Levendusky 2019), on average, people dislike leaders more than voters (see also Bolsen &

Thornton 2021); and a more recent comparative study (Kingzette 2021) has shown that

sentiments towards leaders and parties result in an over-estimation of affective polarisation.

Given this, for the period of 2018-9 we re-estimate the same model using in-group and out group partisan polarisation measured by feeling thermometer ratings towards the voters of

different parties instead of the parties as organizations or their leaders. As observed in Table

5, the results are consistent and practically reproduce those in Table 4 with one difference:

17

the positive effects of in-group partisan polarisation on political trust are even weaker than

the ones previously observed based on sentiments towards leaders.

(Table 5)

Robustness check: Estimating a REWB model

FE models are based on the assumption that the within- effects are constant regardless

of the wave (time context) (Bell & Jones 2014, p. 137). In our case, this would assume that

changes observed for the within- effect of polarisation on political trust is the same as the

cross-sectional effect (being equally polarised on average, over the course of the period under

observation). This is a problematic assumption for this analysis given the importance of

some of the political events that happened in Spain during the time period under study. For

instance, it seems that the aggregate levels of polarisation during this time increased as a

result of escalating political disputes, which may have conditioned the effect of individual

variation in polarisation on political trust in different ways. This problem is evident if there is

high correlation between some independent variable in the model and the context (time)

variance, proving that Cov Xij, µj ≠0 and, thus, resulting in a ‘heterogeneity bias’ (Bell &

Jones 2014, pp. 138-9).

To resolve this issue, we include the wave averages of the most relevant variables in

the model to estimate the between-wave variation. In doing so, we obtain two types of

parameters for each variable: one for the within-individual variation (which is exactly the

same as the fixed effects); and another for the between-wave variation (time or aggregate

average effects).

Additionally, OLS fixed effects models do not allow us to test the effect of time

invariant variables (in our case we have only an initial time measure of political

18

receptiveness), or variables with very little variance over time (such as party identification)

(Bell & Jones 2014, pp. 140-1). This allows us to include as controls partisan identification

with the two radical parties in the Spanish system, Unidas Podemos (United We Can) and the

right-wing party Vox, resulting in a more demanding model to test our main two hypotheses.

With that in mind we opt to estimate a longitudinal OLS Random Effects Within and

Between (REWB) model with panel data (Bell Fairbrother & Jones 2018, p. 1052). These

models offer a solution for the ‘heterogeneity bias’ by allowing the inclusion of the fixed

effects (within) and the between-wave effects (time averages at the aggregate levels),

resulting in more robust and less biased estimators than those obtained with fixed effects

models (Bell & Jones 2014, pp. 143-4; Bell Fairbrother & Jones 2018, pp. 1059-60). In other

words, REWB models can estimate fixed effects and time aggregate average effects, resulting

in more robust and unbiased estimators than those obtained with FE models (Bell & Jones

2014, p. 143-4; Bell, Fairbrother & Jones 2018, pp. 1059-60).

Thus we estimate the following REWB model:

𝑌𝑖𝑡= 𝛼𝑖𝑜+ 𝛽1𝑖𝜏𝑖+ 𝛽𝑡𝛾̅𝑡+ 𝛽2𝑖𝑍𝑖 + 𝜇𝑖+ 𝜀𝑖𝑡

where 𝜏𝑖 is a vector of individual fixed effects (𝑥̅it-xi): in-group and out-group affective

polarisation, perceived ideological polarisation, ideological extremism, territorial

polarisation, political interest, economic evaluation, corruption evaluation, government

evaluation, issue positioning, and personal economic uncertainty index). 𝛾̅𝑡 is a vector of 𝑥̅it

for the polarisation variables. 𝑍𝑖 is the vector of the time invariant variables included:

Podemos PID and Vox PID.

In Table 6 we display the results of the REWB models (with partisan affective

polarisation measured by sentiments towards voters as the dependent variable). These results

19

give us unbiased estimates that show even stronger effects of partisan affective out-group

(negative) polarisation on political trust than in the previous FE models, again confirming H2.

These models show only some variations regarding our argument. There are stronger and

more consistent positive effects of in-group polarisation (H1) although always weaker than

the negative effects of out-group polarisation, except for political parties, politicians and

government. These results also reveal that the polarisation produced by the conflict around

territorial identities has an overall negative effect on individual-level trust in all institutions

except for the courts, showing that polarisation caused by other non-partisan identities could

have a negative effect on political trust once those identities are politicised. Additionally, it

seems that identification with the radical right-wing party, Vox, significantly decreases the

individual levels of political trust in institutions of democratic representation, even after

controlling for the effects of other relevant variables. This finding is also present for Unidas

Podemos, although only for trust in the regional governments and courts.

(Table 6)

Finally, in the preceding analyses we could not include the observations from the

fourth wave of the E-DEM panel, since that wave did not include sufficient information to

compute the ideological polarisation indices. To check the robustness of the preceding

results, we have estimated the same FE models from Tables 4 and 5 but with the ideological

variables dropped, which allows us to include the fourth wave in our longitudinal model. The

results in Tables 5A and 6A in the online Appendix show that we get the same results with

the increase in the number of observations after including the fourth wave and the two

ideological polarisation indices dropped from the models. The results appear to be very

robust despite these modifications in our models and the inclusion of the additional

20

observations. We also ran an ancillary analysis using a first difference regression model, the

results of which are almost identical (Table 7A in online Appendix).

Conclusions and implications

In the preceding pages we have shown that, in addition to the traditional factors in

explaining political trust related to the concept of trust-as-evaluation, partisan affective

polarisation might be a key factor in explaining the recent decline in political trust. In our

analyses we find that affective polarisation has divergent effects: in-group polarisation tends

to increase trust while out-group polarisation diminishes it. Although these are opposing

effects, our results show that the negative effect of out-group polarisation is much stronger,

explaining the overall negative effect of affective polarisation on political trust. We find

these effects to be consistent for all types of institutions and levels of government (with the

exception of politicians, political parties and government in the REBW models), and

regardless of the political context and parties causing polarisation. Additionally, the effect of

ideological polarisation is small or null. These results seem to be solid and robust after

controlling for variations in individual positions on important issues in the Spanish politics

during this time and even after taking into consideration party identification with the most

extremist parties.

Although our findings are limited in that the data comes from a case study

characterised by very low levels of trust and covers a very limited period of time, the findings

of this article help to shed light on the relationship between affective polarisation and

political trust in representative democracies. Our findings clearly demonstrate that in order to

understand the effect of affective polarisation on trust in multiparty systems, it is imperative

to have a more nuanced conceptualisation and corresponding operationalisation of affective

21

polarisation, as our analyses show that in-group and out-group partisan affective polarisation

have different effects. It seems that increasing levels of out-group affective polarisation could

be one of the main drivers in the deterioration of political trust, and that effect is not offset by

the positive effect of in-group polarisation. Additionally, those effects seem to be consistent

across different ideologies of the parties responsible for polarisation and political contexts.

These finding are especially concerning given the confrontational nature of this type of

polarisation, particularly in those democratic settings, like Spain, that seem to be in a scenario

of increasing affective politics as opposed to other more ‘rational’ elements on which to base

political debate, such as policy alternatives and their evaluation.

Our findings help to better understand the nuances of the micro- foundations of the

effects of populist and/or illiberal leaders on political trust (Mauk 2020; Muis, Brils &

Gaidytè 2021; Somer 2019; Svolik 2020;), at least before such parties obtain political power

(Tworzecki 2019). We have confirmed that affective polarisation has the potential to be one

of the ills of democratic functioning (MacKuen et al. 2010; McCoy & Somer 2019; McCoy,

Rahman & Somer 2018), by fostering mistrust towards the main institutions and actors of

political representation, thereby increasing the chances of democratic backsliding by populist

and more radical options of the party supply (Levitsky & Ziblatt 2018; McCoy, Rahman &

Somer 2018; Svolik 2019).

Additionally, these findings imply that political trust might become more volatile in

response to the dynamics of party competition and incumbent popularity, especially in

contexts of high affective polarisation (Theiss-Morse, Barton & Wagner 2015, p. 185). As a

result, citizens’ political trust might be more dependent upon the increasing affective

polarisation promoted by party competition and elite behaviour (McCoy, Rahman & Somer

2018) diminishing the capacity of trust to become the ‘safety net’ in times of political

instability or bad performance.

22

While our results may seem to paint a rather grim picture, there is a possible silver

lining in the opposing effects of in-group and out-group polarisation on trust. Although the

negative effects of out-group polarisation outweigh the positive effect of in-group

polarisation in the contemporary Spanish context, there may be some cases in which the

effect of in-group polarisation is stronger and thereby generates a net increase in political

trust. Further research is needed to determine if that situation is possible and, if so, under

what circumstances.

1 Although this is not a probability sample, the distribution of basic socio-demographic variables and of other partisan and ideological characteristics in our sample approximates the same parameters obtained by the National Centre for Sociological Research (CIS) during the same years. In our sample, we only find a lower propensity to declare an intention to vote for the more traditional parties before the general election in 2015. In addition, our sample is skewed towards the more educated than the general population (National Institute of Statistics – INE – Census data 2014-2015) (for more details, see Table 3A the Online Appendix).
