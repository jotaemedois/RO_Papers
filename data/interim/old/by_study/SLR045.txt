Abstract

This thesis examines a previously unstudied site of interaction: the constituency office. At the

constituency office, Members of Parliament (MPs) hold ‘MP surgeries’, during which they

help constituents to solve their personal difficulties. This thesis provides the first analysis of

interactions at the constituency office. It is the only place where ordinary citizens can meet

their MP; as such, it also provides the first analysis of face-to-face, unmediated interactions

between politicians and their constituents. For this study, 12.5 hours of interactional data

were recorded at the office of an MP in the United Kingdom, comprising over 80 encounters

between office staff, the MP, and their constituents. The MP was of the majority

(‘government’) party at the time of recording. The data were analyzed using conversation

analysis (CA), in order to investigate how the social activities of the constituency office were

accomplished through interaction.

The first analytic chapter reveals the overall structure of constituency office encounters,

as well as examining what constituents say when they call or visit the office, and how they

express that they are in need of assistance. This chapter finds that constituents avoid making

direct requests of their MP, and instead use narrative descriptions. These descriptions manage

interactional challenges including the ‘unknown’ nature of the institution (Stokoe, 2013b),

contingency and entitlement (Drew & Curl, 2008), reasonableness and legitimacy (Edwards

& Stokoe, 2007; Heritage & Robinson, 2006), and recruitment (Kendrick & Drew, 2016).

The second analytic chapter examines the action of offering, and finds it to be the central

mechanism for transacting service. The staff use different offer designs to index different

nuances in the offering action, such as asking permission or confirming an activity. Both the

first and second analytic chapters show that systematic deployment of offers help control the

direction of the encounters and tacitly instruct constituents as to what services are available.

Furthermore, both of these chapters show the flexibility participants employed in turn design

and action ascription, which extends previous descriptions of how requests and offers are

constructed (Couper-Kuhlen, 2014; Curl, 2006) and supports recent calls for a more nuanced

approach to action description from conversation analysts (Kendrick & Drew, 2014; Sidnell

& Enfield, 2014).

The third analytic chapter investigates the ostensibly ‘political’ context of the

constituency office, and how the MP and constituents raise political topics in conversation.

The chapter finds that the term ‘political’ is challenging to define in live interactions, and

3

relies on the concept of ‘politicizing’ (Hay, 2007) statements that upgrade (or downgrade) a

topic into greater (or lesser) public and governmental concern. Both the MP and constituents

were found to initiate political topics, but in different ways. The MP initiated political topics

in explicit references to government, in order to provide evidence that the government was

aligned with constituents’ interests. The constituents initiated political topics in vague and

indirect references to recent policy changes, and avoided implicating the MP in any

criticisms. The findings suggest that constituents privilege interactional norms (such as not

criticizing a co-present interlocutor) over any potential interest in making political critiques.

The chapter also discusses what impact these findings may have on concepts such as ‘power’

and ‘evasion’. The final analytic chapter assesses the concept of ‘rapport’, finding that it is

difficult for both participants and analysts to determine long-term outcomes from local,

interactional occurrences in interaction. ‘Rapport’ is important for MPs who may be

attempting to build a ‘personal vote’ relationship with constituents, but this chapter also finds

that constituents have a stake in building ‘rapport’ in order to receive the best (or any)

service. The chapter finds that while traditional practices for building ‘rapport’, such as doing

small talk or finding common ground, are problematic to employ and assess from an

interactional perspective, other local outcomes such as progressivity (Fogarty, Augoustinos &

Kettler, 2013) and affiliation (Clark, Drew & Pinch, 2003) may be more useful indicators of

positive interactions. This chapter concludes that we need a more nuanced, and

interactionally-based, framework to train practitioners (and clients) in effective

communication practices.

This thesis challenges the conversation analytic literature by finding that the

constituency office setting revolves around a more flexible ascription of requests than many

studies have previously accepted, and that we can analyze actions as if on a spectrum, rather

than in bounded categories. The thesis also contributes to the political discourse literature by

finding that constituents’ activities at the constituency office are strongly influenced by

interactional norms, rather than political attitudes. Finally, this thesis provides a basis from

which to study the constituency office, as a site of service interaction.

Introduction

“>I don’t know if it’s the best route to take.< People keep saying try:, you know, (.)

Michael Johnson because obviously he’ll help you.”

- Constituent of Michael Johnson (MP)

Increasingly, the general consensus is that citizens are disconnected from politics and

government. Yet, all across the United Kingdom and many other democracies, citizens meet

regularly with their Members of Parliament, and have face-to-face interactions together.

These interactions have never been studied before. This thesis is the first to examine the

actual interactions that occur at ‘MP surgeries’ in the United Kingdom, where citizens and

MPs have conversations and solve constituents’ problems.

In many democracies around the world, Members of Parliament (MPs) hold ‘surgeries’

on a regular basis, scheduling meetings with individual (or small groups of) constituents at

their local constituency office. Constituents – the local subset of a nation’s citizens – can

meet their elected representative face-to-face and receive personal assistance. This thesis

presents the first analysis of the interactions that occur during the course of constituency

casework between constituents, the MP, and constituency office staff. It examines these

interactions at a constituency office in the United Kingdom (the MP was of the majority

governing party at the time), a country where constituency casework has been ongoing (with

variable intensity) since medieval times.

That this is the first study of its kind is and should be surprising. The constituency

office is the only place where ordinary citizens and their MP can meet and have

conversations. Despite this, few studies have investigated the constituency office as anything

other than a means to better electoral results and none, to my knowledge, have examined how

MPs (and their staff) and citizens talk to each other, or what they talk about. It is even more

surprising given the widespread interest of news media and government itself in citizen

engagement and interaction with politics. During the writing of this thesis, the United

Kingdom (UK) held a national election (2015), a national referendum (2016), a Scottish

referendum (2014), and several local elections (2012, 2014, 2016); news media regularly

lamented citizen disengagement from politics (Booth; 2015; Coman, 2014; Chorley, 2013;

Jowit, 2012), as well as how disconnected politicians are from everyday citizens (Groves,

2012; Mason, 2013; Nelson, 2012). Citizens are perceived as having limited communication

13

with their elected representatives (Coleman, 2005; Chorley, 2013; Hay 2007; Kurtz, 1997;

Rutter, 2014), and yet many citizens are meeting said representatives regularly at MP

surgeries; MPs report meeting between 200 and 500 constituents per month at the

constituency office (Young Legal Aid Lawyers, 2012). Furthermore, citizens are contacting

constituency offices at an increasing rate (Korris, 2011; Norton & Wood, 1993) and MPs

report spending the single largest amount of their work week on contacting and assisting

individual constituents (28%, Korris, 2011; compare to 21% in the House of Commons) – yet

neither government nor researchers have investigated what actually happens during this

contact. In short, there should be great interest in the institution of the constituency office and

the interactions that occur there.

In this thesis, I will examine a corpus of recorded interactions at a constituency office

in the UK, both telephone calls to the office, and MP surgery face-to-face meetings – a total

of 12.5 hours of interactional data covering 80 encounters. I will analyze this data using

conversation analysis (Sacks, 1992; Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson, 1974; Sidnell, 2010), the

primary means of analyzing spontaneous and naturalistic talk-in-interaction. Conversation

analysis (CA) focuses on how participants use talk in live, actual interactions (rather than,

typically, interviews or constructed or experimentally produced encounters). CA will provide

detailed insight how participants organize their talk and use it to accomplish social actions. It

is crucial to examine how these interactions actually proceed in order to understand what the

social organization of the constituency office is.

Chapter summaries

First, in Chapter 1, I review what research exists investigating how politicians communicate

with constituents. The majority of research into political communication has focused on mass

media, political interviews, campaigning, and Parliamentary procedure. Some studies have

examined the constituency office, but mostly as a means to increasing the success of an

incumbent candidate at elections. I will discuss in detail the handful of studies that have

systematically examined the casework that constituency offices achieve, but show that none

of these studies have yet examined the interactions and actual conversations that occur at the

office. I will also situate my research in interactional and institutional studies that have

examined politicians interacting on news media (e.g., Ekström, Djerf-Pierre, Johansson &

Håkansson, 2015), doctors and patients (e.g., Heritage & Maynard, 2006), and street-level

bureaucracy services (e.g., Bruhn & Ekström, 2015). Prior research in institutional interaction

has likewise not yet investigated the constituency office. This review motivates my thesis to

14

address the following issues: how the interactions at the constituency office are organized,

and to take a first look at how politicians and constituents interact with each other.

Next, Chapter 2 explains the methodological approach taken in this thesis. I describe

how the constituency office in this study is organized. I present a description of the roles and

responsibilities of the major participants in the data, as well as a brief demographic overview

of the constituent participants. I give details of how I collected and analyzed data, and a brief

overview of conversation analysis. Finally, I discuss the ethical considerations raised by this

study, and how I addressed those concerns.

In the first analytic chapter, Chapter 3, I provide an overview of the interactional

structure of surgery meetings: how they open, how constituents present their concerns, where

the MP and staff make offers, and how those offers and concerns are negotiated. In particular,

I focus on how constituents describe their difficulties, and how they pursue the description of

their difficulties throughout the meeting. Constituents increase the complaint-like nature of

their difficulties over the course of the meeting. I find that constituents use descriptions of

their difficulty, rather than requests, and that this practice manages several interactional

challenges at once: contingency and entitlement, actionability, and the issue of the ‘unknown’

institution (Stokoe, 2013). The MP and constituency caseworkers first respond to these

descriptions with offers, before switching to affiliative turns that sequentially obscure the

relevance of further offers.

Following on the issue of offers, in Chapter 4 I analyze the design and sequential

position of the offers that the MP and staff make to constituents. I show how the MP and

caseworkers change the design of their offers over the course of encounters. Different designs

index different components of offers more strongly. Offers that are designed in the format

‘Can I do X for you’ tend to highlight the relevance of initial permission to continue with the

offered action, and treat the offer as a proposal. Offers that use the format ‘I will do X’ act

like announcements, treating permission as already accomplished or irrelevant. Finally, offers

that are designed with the format ‘let me do X’ act like requests, seeking compliance (rather

than permission) from constituents in order to complete the offer. Chapter 4, therefore,

demonstrates how actions such as offers cannot be strictly bounded into categories, since

these offers overlap with other actions such as announcements and requests. Turn design can

accomplish additional actions and nuances. These format changes are particularly useful for

the MP and staff, who use the different forms in a systematic way to help control the

direction of the encounter.

15

In Chapter 5, I analyze the ‘political’ topics that are raised at the constituency office.

Overtly ‘political’ talk is rare at the office; rather, it arises in the corpus as a tangent to other

concerns. I show how political topics may be made relevant by either the MP or constituents,

and how collaboration is necessary to achieve the topic as political. I will demonstrate that

the MP raises political topics to display the government as aligned with constituent interests.

Constituents, on the other hand, mostly raise political topics as part of criticisms of

government actions. Constituents must manage the interactional challenge of criticizing a

person to their face, and as a result, constituents’ comments are indirect, with markers of

delicacy. Constituents appear to privilege the interactional norms and relationship with the

MP, over any potential desire to make ‘political’ points. I conclude by discussing how only

an interactional analysis could reveal the difficulties in raising policy criticisms to an MP,

and how interactional norms have a crucial impact on how, when, and to whom we express

political talk.

The final analytic chapter, Chapter 6, investigates the question of ‘rapport’. Rapport,

generally defined as a feeling of connection and trust, is widely used in communication

literature and training. Rapport is a means to an end, a way to make service encounters more

effective. MPs have a vested interest in building and maintaining ‘rapport’ with their

constituents because they rely on that ‘rapport’ to improve their chances of being re-elected.

In seeking this ‘personal vote’, MPs must maintain good relations with constituents, and

seeking to build rapport is one way to achieve this. As such, rapport is of critical interest to

MPs doing constituency casework. In this chapter, I will evaluate previous studies on rapport,

and show that these studies have neglected an analysis of what rapport looks like in

interaction. I will argue that rapport cannot be assessed in situ, in a live interaction, but is a

post-hoc variable that is assessed either by participants (e.g., in interviews) or analysts (e.g.,

in experimental studies). I will also demonstrate that, at the constituency office, constituents

have as vested an interest in building rapport as the MP. The stake of constituents, or clients,

in rapport has never been analyzed before. I will show that while rapport is not accessible to

participants during a live interaction, the local outcomes of interactional practices are

accessible. The concept of rapport may not be necessary in order to achieve positive relations

and positive local outcomes. This finding will impact not only MPs, but other service

practitioners in other institutional settings.

In the final chapter, I discuss the findings in this thesis. Within the field of conversation

analysis, this thesis has provided further evidence to support the concept of ‘recruitment’

(Kendrick & Drew, 2016). Not only do constituents work to achieve recruitment, the use of

16

recruitment instead of direct requests solves other interactional challenges simultaneously.

This thesis has also provided evidence for a more nuanced appreciation of conversational

action (Sidnell & Enfield, 2014), primarily that actions can overlap and achieve more than

the central component of the action. The results of this thesis show the importance of

investigating the interactional structures of a setting. Constituents face interactional

challenges in raising political criticisms, which suggests we may need to reevaluate our

concept of how citizens raise political concerns with their MP. Political communication

studies have not appreciated nor analyzed how critical an analysis of interaction can be for

understanding the norms that influence what is communicated at constituency offices. The

concept of ‘rapport’ is also problematic when analyzed from an interactional perspective.

Past studies of rapport have failed to address how rapport can be determined or constructed in

live interaction, making it unhelpful for communication training purposes. However, the

findings from this thesis, which stem from a detailed analysis of interaction, can be used to

develop communication training. Using the Conversation Analytic Role-play Method,

conversation analytic findings can be translated into applied communication training. By

improving communication, this thesis can have a positive impact on how constituents and

Members of Parliament interact.

Chapter 1:

The constituency office: Research and practice

1.0 Introduction

Each year, every constituency office in the United Kingdom deals with up to several

thousand requests from constituents. Each of these requests involves a form of personal

contact between the constituency office staff and constituent: a letter or email, a phone call,

and/or a meeting with the Member of Parliament (MP). The most recent figures state that

MPs report spending 28% of their workweek on this ‘casework’ (Korris, 2011), which is the

highest category of work time they report (cf. Parliament time at 21%, and other constituency

events at 21%). Most MPs also employ staff whose main purpose is to deal with casework

and the United Kingdom (UK) spends over £106.2 million on MPs’ budgets for running

constituency offices (Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, 2015 – based on non London area office rental and staffing costs), where constituents can raise their concerns.

MPs have reported for many years that they consider constituency work and representing the

constituency to be the most important aspect of their job, often above holding the government

to account (Korris, 2011; Rosenblatt, 2006). In other words, work at the MP’s constituency

office is a major activity for politicians. Casework is also important for the constituent, as

constituency offices are the only place that ordinary citizens can see their MP in person (see

Chapter 2 for a description of the constituency office studied in this thesis). Furthermore,

constituency casework is conducted in many different countries, especially those with

parliamentary democracies (see Abdel-Samad, 2009; Arter, 2010; Benstead, 2008; Clarke,

Price & Krause, 1975; Costa, Lefébure, Rozenberg, Schnatterer & Kerrouche, 2012; Hazama,

2005; Heitshusen, Young & Wood, 2005).

Despite constituency offices being so commonplace in parliamentary democracies, and

such a central feature of British MPs’ daily life, relatively little research has been conducted

on them, compared studies of political discourse and communication more generally. Of the

research that exists, most of it examines constituency service or casework as an activity that

does, or does not, affect election results. There are almost no studies at all that systematically

investigate what actually happens at a constituency office. This means that the scientific

community has very little understanding of what MPs and caseworkers do at their offices, let

alone what activities citizens do there. Most of all, we have very little idea how anything is

done there.

18

In this chapter, I will evaluate the existing literature on how politicians communicate

with citizens one-on-one, in several broad areas. First, in Section 1.1, I will situate the thesis

within the broader literature of political communication and political discourse, showing that

this literature mostly ignores the constituency office. Then, in Section 1.2, I will discuss the

existing research concerning the constituency office, demonstrating that most research has

focused on the electoral benefits of casework, rather than on the composition of casework. I

will evaluate the exceptions to this problem in detail. In Section 1.3, I will position the thesis

in the interactional subfield of service encounters and institutions. Although there is a large

body of research on service encounters in other institutional settings, that literature has not

yet examined the constituency office, yet it is the only place a citizen can receive services

directly from their MP. We need to understand how MPs spend their time there, and how

citizens and MPs interact when they are given the chance.

1.1 Political communication literature

In this section I will discuss the overarching and broad spectrum of political discourse

literature within which this thesis sits, before focusing on research that more directly

addresses the constituency office. Most studies of communication in a political context focus

on political discourse in the public sphere (excluding ethnomethodological and conversation

analytic literature on news media and political communication, see Section 1.3). This

includes communications made during campaigns, such as media debates, advertising,

speeches, and communications in legislatures, such as House of Commons debates in

Westminster-style democracies (Bayley, 2004), Private Members’ Bills (Bowler, 2010) and

others (Blidook & Kerby, 2011; Martin, 2011). It also includes textual data such as

government reports, bills, party manifesto, and more (van Dijk, 1997). Major textbooks on

political discourse analysis focus primarily if not solely on these forms of communication

(see Chilton, 2004; van Dijk, 2008). Political discourse analysts typically study the

distribution and reproduction of power (van Dijk, 1997, p.11), and how people with power

(namely, politicians) deliberate and argue over decisions (Fairclough & Fairclough, 2012,

p.1). For instance, in van Dijk’s (1997, p.16-18) definition of the field of political discourse

analysis he neglects any mention of situations in which politicians interact directly, one-on one, with citizens:

That is, politicians talk politically also (or only) if they and their talk is contextualized

in such communicative events such as cabinet meetings, parliamentary sessions,

19

election campaigns, rallies, interviews with the media, bureaucratic practices, protest

demonstrations, and so on. (p.14)

Here (and elsewhere, 2008, p.176), van Dijk neglects the constituency office. He does not

explicitly exclude it, but his map of the terrain demonstrates the way that much of political

discourse studies ignores it. As Cain, Ferejohn and Fiorina (1987, p.51) write,

the scholarly literature has underemphasized service responsiveness [the authors’

terms for caseworker] and allocation of responsiveness. For too long political

scientists have viewed such aspects of representation as primitive or lower forms of

political behaviour – belonging to a category ranging from baby kissing to bribery –

best kept out of serious academic discussion.

Another challenge that remains unaddressed by studies in political communication is the

question of unmediated talk with a politician. Political discourse studies often focus

exclusively on the talk directed towards citizens, rather than talk that includes citizens.

Citizens are represented as a set of people barely involved with politics (Wodak, 2009, p.27),

and, at most, as recipients of communication (Hutchby, 2006; Lewis, Inthorn & Wahl Jorgensen, 2005). Thus although political discourse studies acknowledge the centrality of

language in political activities (Chilton, 2004, p.6-8), ordinary citizens and everyday political

talk are neglected in favour of public media, parliaments, and manifestos. Many studies to

date are based on text or broadcasts, through which politicians (and citizens) talk at each

other, rather than with each other. These formats are highly mediated, edited (Eriksson, 2011)

and structured (Clayman & Heritage, 2002a; Ekström & Kroon Lundell, 2011; see Section

1.3.1), begging the question of how citizens and politicians would (and do) interact in person,

and without a broadcast host or setting.

There is, however, a subsection of political communication research that examines

citizen political talk (see Schmitt-Beck & Lup, 2013 for overview). This literature focuses on

‘horizontal’ (Schmitt-Beck & Lup, 2013) political talk, which refers to the talk between

people with similar amounts of influence or control over large scale political decisions and

processes (usually, a lack of said control). While this literature does examine political talk,

there are four differences between the data examined in the literature, and the data in this

thesis. Firstly, the data in my own thesis does not look at ‘horizontal’ talk, given that it

mostly involves citizen-to-MP, rather than citizen-to-citizen talk (although the question of

20

‘horizontalness’ is interesting in and of itself, see Chapters 5 and 6). Secondly, most of the

research in citizen-to-citizen political talk uses interview and survey techniques (Conover &

Searing, 2005), rather than recordings, which differs from the data in this thesis (but see

Eliasoph, 1998; Walsh, 2004 for studies based on participant observation, although not

recordings or analysis of talk). As a result, these studies lack insight into how talk is

accomplished, and what practices and techniques people use to get social action done.

Interview and survey techniques are limited to analyzing reports, remembrances, and

accounts of people’s past actions (Potter, 2012a, 2012b; Potter & Hepburn, 2007). Some

studies have also used experiments and simulated conversations (e.g., Jackson & Sniderman,

2006; Ryan, 2013), which is not compatible with a goal to understand how conversation

works naturally (Potter & Hepburn, 2007). As Ekström (2016, p.17) points out,

“Conversation analyses of recorded talk would be preferred” in order to understand how

political topics are initiated and managed in conversation, which is, after all, one of the goals

of this thesis (see Section 1.4). As I will later report, interactional rules and norms can have a

big impact on what is discussed at the constituency office (see Chapter 5).

The third difference between studies of citizen-to-citizen political talk and this thesis is

that the talk in this thesis is questionably and inconsistently political (see Chapter 5). The

above studies concern explicitly political talk between citizens, whereas most of the talk at

the constituency office is explicitly not political. The question of what counts as political,

especially in interaction, should also be analyzed as an achievement of talk, rather than as a

category of talk assigned by the analyst (Hepburn & Potter, 2011b). Fourthly, and finally, the

interaction at the constituency office is not what conversation analysts would call ‘mundane’

talk, or what Schmitt-Beck and Lup (2013) call ‘spontaneous’ and ‘unstructured’ talk, as it is

in an institutional setting (Drew & Heritage, 1992). Despite these differences, this subfield of

political communication may still find the constituency office setting interesting, as this

thesis provides another example of analyzing face-to-face conversations in an ostensibly

political setting. Eveland, Morey and Hutchens (2011, p.1098) have especially called for

more observational studies of face-to-face and online political conversations…with an

emphasis on understanding how and why individuals engage in political conversations,

what they actually convey during these conversations, and what implications these

conversations have for their social and political lives.

21

The relatively small amount of research concerning citizen talk in political communication

literature is not without cause; some argue that voters are often uninterested in or unaware of

many of these communications (Dalton, 2000; Hay, 2007), and others have argued that

citizens are historically excluded from political communication (Kurtz, 1997; but see Section

1.3 for studies of journalists-as-public-representatives, radio call-ins, and mediated forms of

access). However, although it may seem like common sense for news media and

Parliamentary debates to be the most prominent part of an MP’s working week and

communication activities, MPs actually report spending the largest portion of their time on

constituency affairs (Korris, 2011). As a result, it is crucial to go beyond the obvious and

examine the constituency office itself.

Overall, the political communication literature is frequently unhelpful in examining the

constituency office. Few studies appear to have considered MP surgeries to be worthy of

study. Many studies also fail to investigate how conversations happen in political settings.

There is a literature that examines how citizens talk to each other, but there is no research

examining how MPs and citizens interact directly (see Section 1.3 for a discussion of the

literature surrounding mediated access to the MP, via radio phone-ins, audience participation,

etc.). We have seen that citizens are often only considered as an audience. In recent years,

however, online communication has opened opportunities for MPs and citizens to engage. I

will next discuss the literature on online MP-to-citizen communication, before turning to

examining the literature on the constituency office itself in Section 1.2.

1.1.1 Politicians communicating online

One place in which one would expect to find studies of politician-constituent interaction is

the growing body of research looking at online communication and social media. More

recently, researchers have been studying politicians’ use of internet technologies to

communicate. These studies examine politicians’ adoption of websites, Facebook, Twitter,

and other tools for advertising, announcements, and consultation (Allen et al., 2013; Stanyer,

2008; Williamson, 2009, 2010). Given that these studies focus on communication, one would

expect to see a more detailed analysis of how MPs, their staff, and citizens communicate with

each other. However, much of the ‘MPs online’ literature focuses on whether current

methods of democratic representation can be changed, or if rates of citizen participation can

be improved with the adoption of various online systems (Coleman, 2005; Lusoli, Ward &

Gibson, 2006). The studies that consider how talk-in-interaction online work tend to focus on

‘degrees of interactivity’, or opportunities for citizens and politicians to mutually interact via

22

online media. Macmillan (2002) created a popular model for categorizing how interactive an

online website or network can be, and whether it is being used in an interactive fashion.

Politicians have largely used online media, both earlier platforms such as static websites and

more recent platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, to promote political messages in the

form of monologues. As Stromer-Galley (2000, p.116) found, “it is evident that political

candidates are using their websites in ways similar to their television or radio advertisements

– as one-way messages.” More recent studies have found “minor” and “incremental” changes

(Lilleker & Malagón, 2010, p.39), in the form of increased dialogic interaction (see also

Otterbacher et al., 2012), but most politicians continue to avoid two-way communication

online (Lilleker & Jackson 2009; Lilleker & Malagón, 2010; Stromer-Galley, 2000). Jackson

and Lilleker (2011) found that of those MPs who regularly tweet, most used Twitter for

announcing news or doing self-promotion, and any ‘conversations’ were not between MPs

and constituents, but between various groups of MPs: “For these MPs, Twitter has become a

virtual ‘smoking room’ where they tease one another, gossip and occasionally score political

points.” (p.100).

The chief finding of the online communication literature is that MPs treat the internet as

another medium on which to send out information, but not as a place for communicating with

constituents. One quote reported from an interview study with MPs sums up this problem

neatly: “Email is a marvellous tool for communication, but a nightmare for MPs. Many

constituents want to have a long email conversation with you. Sadly I have too busy a

schedule.” (Williamson, 2009, p.9). It is interesting to note that despite the intense focus on

interactivity and determining how best to analyze the (potentially) interactive online world,

these studies never reference or mention conversation analysis. Yet there is a methodological

framework being developed for analyzing how online communication takes place (see Giles,

et al., 2015; Meredith & Potter, 2013; Meredith & Stokoe, 2014), which would precisely

capture the interactive (or not) features of online communication with politicians. This further

highlights the need for conversation analysts to tackle political settings.

In summary, there is a large body of literature covering political communication

generally, which largely focuses on how media and politicians speak at, rather than with,

citizen audiences. Where citizens are analyzed, most research investigates how they talk to

each other, rather than to MPs. There is little research examining how communication is done

at constituency offices. The above studies do not focus on constituency offices at all: how

they function, who is present, what they accomplish, and so forth. Moving beyond political

discourse and communication, however, there is a subsection of political science that

23

examines the activities that actually occur at constituency offices, albeit with little to no

emphasis on communicative practices. I will outline this literature in the next section.

1.2 The constituency office

Much political science literature sees constituency service as a ‘puzzle’ (Norris, 1997):

behaviour that is motivated by potential electoral gain, despite uncertain evidence for that

gain. As a result, the question of why MPs do constituency service is addressed on multiple

fronts, while the question of how they provide service and what services they provide are

rarely systematically investigated. I will first look at studies that examine why MPs do

casework. I will then examine studies concerning what activities constituency casework

comprises. These studies are mostly interview and survey studies, and show us what MPs and

citizens report about constituency office work. Finally, I will discuss in detail the few

observational studies that have investigated casework and constituency offices. These are the

studies that report how citizens, office staff, and politicians behave and communicate at

surgeries. None of these studies take an interactional approach, and most have significant out of-date components in comparison with modern casework, such as a heavy focus on letter writing (instead of email). This section especially shows the gap in our knowledge about how

activities are carried out and organized at the constituency office, a gap that my thesis will

begin to fill.

1.2.1 Why do constituency casework

There has been a long-standing debate over whether constituency service helps to improve an

MP’s chance of re-election. MPs that engage in constituency service engage in interpersonal

interaction with constituents, rather than just appearing in advertisements or as a faceless

name at the ballot box, so it is possible that constituents are influenced to vote for an MP that

they know, and to whom they feel indebted for prior assistance. Doing casework in order to

earn familiarity, trust, respect, and most of all gratitude, is called cultivating a ‘personal vote’

(Cain et al., 1987). Most studies have been of elected representatives in the United Kingdom

or United States, with a few studies of other European countries or former British colonies

(Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand) (e.g., Docherty, 1997; Heitshusen et al., 2005;

Norton & Wood, 1993). In some countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, the personal vote is

more of a contract, rather than gratitude, and MPs grant favours with the expectation (rather

than the hope) of being repaid at voting time (Abdel-Samad, 2009). Cain, Ferejohn and

Fiorina (1987) wrote a seminal book on the personal vote, interviewing politicians and their

24

staff in the United Kingdom and United States, as well as drawing on surveys for

constituents’ opinions. Theirs was an early foray into systematically examining the effect of

constituency service on the politicians and constituents, finding that

representatives and staff in both countries think that casework can be politically

beneficial whatever the outcome so long as it is handled properly. This corresponds

with the finding that most citizens who contact their representative for help or

information tend to find the incumbent’s response satisfactory and evaluate the

incumbent positively. (p.69).

Cain et al. inspired researchers to measure where constituents’ positive feelings had a

significant effect on voting results. However, while some studies find the effect of the

personal vote to be significant, or significant enough to be worth pursuing (e.g., Butler &

Collins, 2001; Dogan, 2007; Heitshusen et al., 2005; Vivyan & Wagner, 2015), others find

the effect to be too small (e.g., Gaines, 1998; Johannes & McAdams, 1981; Johnston &

Pattie, 2009; Norris, 1997). One study even suggested that politicians may prefer (whether

consciously or not) to have bureaucratic inefficiencies in the United States because it

provided opportunity to cultivate a personal vote (Moon, Serra & Best, 1993). None of these

studies analyze the constituency casework itself, though, making it more difficult to

determine a link between specific constituency office practices and any positive incumbency

effect for the MP. Furthermore, many other factors can influence the existence and size of the

personal vote, including personal history in the constituency (Tavits, 2010) and party

affiliation (Benstead, 2008; Johnston & Pattie, 2009), and these additional factors add to

speculation that casework is not a ‘profitable’ avenue for studying successful electioneering.

As Parker and Goodman (2009, p.496) point out, the relationship between constituency

casework and vote results is not direct or simple, and thus it is unsurprising that past studies

have led to conflicting results.

Political literature also has a lengthy history in discussing ‘role theory’ (Clarke, Price &

Krause, 1975; Searing, 1994). Role-related studies classify MPs into categories based on the

MPs’ propensity to focus on certain aspects of their job, such as legislation, career

advancement, or constituency work. ‘Local’, ‘constituency’, or ‘welfare officer’ MPs

(Searing, 1994) are those who prioritize constituency service above other responsibilities, not

necessarily in order to cultivate a ‘personal vote’, but for a wide variety of incentives,

including a personal desire to simply help constituents (Franks, 2007; Searing, 1985; Studlar

25

& McAllister, 1996). Some studies also subdivide MPs into different types of ‘constituency

MPs’, based on what casework activities they prioritize (Norton, 1994), or based on the

degree to which their office gets involved in cases (Siefken, 2014). Heitshusen et al. (2005)

have found that different electoral systems put different pressures on MPs to engage in

constituency casework, and limit or provide time and resources for it in different ways. These

‘roles’ may also influence how MPs act in Parliament, and may put forward more

constituency related questions in the House of Commons (Blidook & Kerby, 2011), or more

constituency related Private Members’ Bills (Bowler 2010). But these studies represent

another avenue in which researchers examine the why-it-is-done and not the how-it-is-done of

constituency office casework. In the next subsection, I will discuss the research that has

investigated what constituency casework comprises, and what MPs and citizens describe that

they do, in interviews about constituency offices.

1.2.2 Constituency casework

Beyond the papers addressing the electioneering impact of constituency casework, there is a

small, growing set of literature that analyzes constituency casework itself. Most of these

studies are achieved via interviewing politicians and caseworkers or staff (although see

Hazama, 2005; Korris, 2011; and Leduc & Pammett, 2014, for surveys). A small subset of

these studies actually observes constituency casework being accomplished. However, none of

these studies captures the constituents’ perspectives on casework, focusing instead on the

staff or politician ‘side’. Also, with one exception (Rawlings, 1990a, 1990b), none of these

studies manages to present a systematic and rigorous analysis of what casework is actually

accomplished during the study period. Finally, none of these studies analyzes the

communication and interactional achievement of constituency casework.

Casework arises in interview studies both when the interviews concern casework itself,

and when the interviews concern other aspects of parliamentary life (see Loat & MacMillan,

2014), possibly because it is such a ubiquitous part of a politician’s working week (Korris,

2011). Most interview studies have produced similar findings (see below); MPs are found to

be spending large amounts of time at the constituency office doing casework, despite public

perception that they spend more of their time in the legislature. Staff and MPs consistently

report that constituents bring the same problems, across different nations and different

constituents, which Le Lidec (2009) calls “the hit-parade of difficulties” (p.e122) (but see

Abdel-Samad, 2009, p.426, who found in his study of Lebanon and Jordan that common

26

casework involved getting Hajj visas, covering health costs, or getting a constituent a job).

Macleod (2014, p.38), summarizes the difficulties as follows:

Every imaginable grievance passed through their doors: nasty child custody fights;

accusations of workplace discrimination; decades-long battles to reunite distant

families; shocking miscarriages of justice; and stories of intractable tax collectors run

amok. Any new staffer would immediately find himself or herself swamped by the

endless stream of employment insurance claims, missing passports, and neglected

veterans.

This kind of summary is common, and many studies investigating how politicians behave at

the constituency office note something similar. For example, Loat and MacMillan (2014,

p.139) write,

This can mean assisting constituents with the bureaucratic matters – immigration,

employment insurance, passports or veterans’ support. It also includes helping people

benefit from federal programs or legislation, and fulfilling the role of a representative

by attending social occasions or other commemorative events.

Two of the most widely cited studies, Norton and Wood (1993) and Searing (1994), also

summarize casework in this way. Searing focuses on a role-theory explanation for why MPs

engage in casework and the casework itself never receives analytic attention. Norton and

Wood argue that constituency office work is worthy of investigation. They produce historical

evidence that casework is a significant obligation in the MP’s schedule, and that casework

has been increasing exponentially over time (p.43); however, the investigation of casework

itself never rises beyond description of the MP’s interest and procedure. These kind of

summaries are reductive, as they efface the interactional work required to accomplish

constituency casework. Summarizing casework in a list of typical activities glosses over

important details such as how often any given item is requested, how the constituency office

attempts to fix the problem, and most importantly, how the problems are communicated and

discussed. In these glosses we see a microcosmic example of Cain et al.’s (1987, p.51)

criticism above, which bears repeating: “political scientists have viewed such aspects of

representation as primitive or lower forms of political behaviour – belonging to a category

27

ranging from baby kissing to bribery – best kept out of serious academic discussion”

(emphasis added).

MPs and caseworkers also typically offer help even when it is outside their jurisdiction

(Le Lidec, 2009, p.e126; Siefken, 2014, p.10) or when there is little that can be done (see

Rawlings, 1990a, 1990b, below). As Ortiz et al. (2004, p.57) put it, “Most problems that

come into the district office for caseworker are of the ‘desperation’ nature, meaning this is

the constituent’s last stop after a long, fruitless, and frustrating journey.” The constituents

have serious problems that need addressing, and MPs are willing to go through the motions

of helping if it will make constituents feel better. As Docherty (1997, p.179) notes,

“Intervention by the member signifies the case is perhaps more serious, but also that the

person has a legitimate concern.” MPs and staff report that the success of casework is not

always important: even acting as a good listener or going through the motions of helping can

be enough to satisfy constituents (Gay, 2005; Le Lidec, 2009; Ortiz, Wirz, Semion &

Rodriguez, 2004). Finally, Eagles, Koop and Loat (2014, p.202) report that an MP acts as an

“‘ombudsman of last resort’ for their constituents, called upon to intervene in problems that

have defied successful resolution through more conventional channels”. In other words,

casework was a last-ditch effort to get a problem solved (see also Young Legal Aid Lawyers,

2012, 2013). Casework often offers aid to desperate citizens who fall in bureaucratic ‘grey

zones’. Most cases in this thesis’ data corpus fit this description.

A few interview-based studies of MPs and constituency work are worth mentioning in

some detail because they go beyond descriptions of casework to investigate the day-to-day

functioning of constituency offices. Le Lidec (2009) examined how MPs allocate and

organize their staff. Le Lidec used interviews, analysis of websites, and questionnaires to

determine what kinds of activities MPs and their staff undertook, how MPs’ staff were

allocated to address the constituency’s needs, and the bias in French politics for a heavy

focus on constituency service. His study is an excellent example of investigating the what

portion of constituency offices, but he did not examine actual interactions or actual cases.

Koop (2012) interviewed thirty-two Canadian MPs to discuss how the party

constituency association helped the MP and their office to communicate with constituents.

Party constituency associations try to have members in many different ‘sectors’ of the

constituency – in other words, in sub-constituency level communities that comprise different

socio-economic, cultural, and language groups. The key difference to this thesis, besides the

lack of interactional analysis, is that the communication in Koop’s study is mediated; the

party association representatives act as go-betweens for the sectors and the MP. It is as much

28

a process of mutually informing either side of each other’s activities as it is of

communicating, and overall, the MP is not the communicator in question.

Macleod (2005, 2006, 2014) visited constituency offices in Canada and examined how

the offices were organized and what kind of activities MPs undertook. However, this study,

while noteworthy for being one of the few to investigate actual casework and constituency

offices, was not systematic or scientific, and contains only anecdotal evidence. The study

involved Macleod visiting “nearly 100” (2014, p.36) constituency offices across Canada. It is

unclear in any of Macleod’s three reports (2005, 2006, 2014) exactly how these offices were

chosen, what the results were of the questionnaire distributed, what the questionnaire

examined, whether and how interview data was collected, and if any attempts were made to

collect data from constituents themselves, rather than solely constituency caseworkers and

MPs.

The studies described above manage to have wider coverage, talking to many MPs

within any given country (on the low end is Koop, 2012 with 46 MPs and local officials; on

the high end is Brouard, Costa, Kerrouche & Schnatterer, 2013, with 230 MPs). Although the

larger sample size is useful, the detail concerning what comprises constituency service is

missing. As discussed above, the casework is often glossed as a list of frequent topics, rather

than examined as a detailed set of practices. These interview-based studies rely on self-report,

mostly of MPs, also suggesting that the results may be biased towards the perceptions of

MPs. There is a small subset of studies that have investigated actual casework activities using

observation, to which I now turn.

1.2.3 Observational studies of constituency offices

Fenno’s (1978) study, Home Style, is one of the most influential papers in the constituency

office literature. Fenno accompanied 18 Congressmen [sic] in the United States to their

constituencies and undertook participant observation. Similar to Koop’s (2012) study, Fenno

examined how the Congressmen reached out to subsections of the constituency population

and how the Congressmen perceived their relationships with those communities. As both

Koop and Fenno have demonstrated, the constituency is not a homogenous entity, and is a

very complex population, making it challenging to represent the wishes of all constituents at

any given time. Fenno was one of the first to examine how Congressmen divided their time

and efforts between legislation and constituency activities (followed by Arter, 2010;

Heitshusen et al. 2005, for example), and how they allocate resources (followed by Le Lidec,

2009; Parker & Goodman, 2009), and what effect Congressmen believed their constituency

29

efforts had on re-election. This study was ground-breaking and original at the time, but is

now nearly four decades out-of-date, taking place prior to the substantial increase in

casework observed by Norton and Wood (1993), and prior to email and other forms of

contact. Furthermore, it does not provide detailed analysis of interactions between

Congressmen and constituents, focusing more on the Congressmen’s activities.

Siefken (2012) conducted an observational study of MPs at constituency events,

observing 64 different German MPs for approximately three days each, and coding the MPs’

behaviour. The study focused on coding events that the MP attended in the constituency,

rather than constituency casework. Siefken’s study is notable for being one of the few studies

to observe constituency activities, and one of the few to document constituency events

themselves. However, although Siefken’s study coded communicative activities with

constituents, the methodology was problematic for understanding how MPs communicate.

The interactions with constituents were not recorded and are unavailable for analysis. The

observations were coded into categories and scales (such as how often ‘political’ topics were

discussed), obscuring the actual manner in which the communication took place. Coding not

only prevents analysis of the original interaction, it can also demonstrate problematic

assumptions; for instance, in Siefken’s study, the coders decided whether politicians at events

were ‘listening to’ or ‘presenting’ political positions. The analysis in this thesis demonstrates

that there can be no meaningful distinction between ‘listening’ and ‘presenting’ as both are

always present (see Chapters 3-6). Thus the more important distinctions are found in how

citizens and MPs express their positions.

The only study to date, to the best of my knowledge, that directly and systematically

studies constituency casework itself is Rawlings’s (1990a, 1990b) investigation of the actual

letters received and sent by the constituency office. The study examined the letters of seven

MPs, representing all major parties at the time, and including all letters pertaining to cases

that were opened at the beginning of the three-month study period, and closed by the end of

it. Rawlings also interviewed the caseworkers and MPs about their casework. Rawlings found

that each MP’s office had a different style of management, and offered slightly different

services, but that all offices agreed to help in some way with almost every case. Rawlings

also found that, according to the MPs and caseworkers, many constituents simply needed an

explanatory response from the agency with whom they had a disagreement, and that earning

that response for the constituent was considered a success.

Rawlings’s study should surprise scientists for a few reasons. Firstly, that casework is

often not ‘successful’, in the sense of changing an agency’s decision (such as a council’s

30

housing committee’s decision on a tenant renovation), but that it can be successful simply by

fetching an explanation. Secondly, that constituents receive different access to services

depending on who happens to be their MP, despite constituency casework being a nation wide endeavour. Thirdly, and most importantly, it is surprising that Rawlings (1990a, 1990b)

is the only systematic study to have looked at actual casework and made first-hand

observations of its accomplishment. Rawlings’s study (along with Fenno, 1978; Norton &

Wood, 1993; and Searing, 1994) is now significantly out-of-date. The most popular and

observable form of contact was letter-writing, but now constituents and MPs mostly use

email (Korris, 2011). The use of email, along with the increase in budget allocations for MP

constituency expenditures (compare Ward, 2000, at £50 000, to Independent Parliamentary

Standards Authority, 2016, at £164 000), allows for more frequent contact, as well as a larger

quantity of contact (House of Modernisation Committee, 2007, ev. 74; Jackson, 2003; Korris,

2013, p.20). A final limitation of Rawlings’s study is that it does not attempt to address live

and in-person interaction, which is what this thesis will analyze (see Chapters 3-6).

In this section, I have outlined the literature that investigates the constituency office

itself. Studies that examine constituency casework via interviews tend to have larger sample

sizes, but focus solely on the opinions and experiences of MPs and their staff. The studies of

actual constituency casework, above, have documented the activities that comprise casework

in much greater detail than election-related studies, but this literature still fails to address the

constituent experience. The lack of studies examining actual casework suggests that scientists

have hitherto shown no interest in the details of casework activities, and/or that acquiring

permission to record or observe politicians at work has been challenging (see Chapter 2).

My overview of the literature has shown that there are two major gaps in our

knowledge: an understanding of the constituent experience of casework, and a detailed

understanding of how casework is achieved in interaction. Although some studies have

addressed constituent opinions, these have been from the perspective of understanding what

would motivate constituents to vote for or generally approve of a candidate (Ågren, Dahlberg

& Mörk, 2006; Vivyan & Wagner, 2015). A better understanding of the constituent

experience could be determined from a detailed analysis of actual casework. As for

understanding interaction, it is important to remember that all casework is achieved via

interaction between staff, MPs, and constituents. Without interaction, casework cannot be

accomplished. As Ekström and Patrona (2011, p.1) write, “Conversation is a vital medium of

politics. …politics is partly created and articulated, made public and disputable, in a variety

of more or less institutionalized forms of talk and interaction.” It is therefore important to

31

study the interactions there, in order to understand this institution. Given the importance of

interaction, I now turn to interaction-based studies. These studies are yet to examine the

constituency office, but they do provide a scaffold of other work that has examined

institutions from an interactional perspective.

1.3 Interacting with politicians and service workers in institutional settings

In order to appreciate how this thesis is situated in the ethnomethodological and conversation

analytic literature, I now turn to studies of institutions. The constituency office is an

institution, in that encounters there are “task-related and they involve at least one participant

who represents a formal organization” (Drew & Heritage, 1992, p.3), in this case the MP

and/or caseworker, and the layperson, or constituent. According to Drew and Heritage (1992,

p.4), the participants’ “institutional or professional identities are somehow made relevant to

the work activities in which they are engaged.” This is true of the MP and caseworker in

potentially unexpected ways: although the political identity of the MP and caseworker may

not be made relevant (see Chapter 5), their professional roles as experts in the local

bureaucracies and governmental agencies are regularly made relevant.

The institutional literature has covered many settings in the past (Drew & Heritage,

1992; Heritage & Clayman, 2010). News interviews (e.g., Clayman & Heritage, 2002a),

courtrooms (Atkinson & Drew, 1979; Drew, 1992), police investigations (Edwards, 2008;

Kidwell, 2009), telephone call centres (Butler et al., 2010; Emmison & Danby, 2007), family

mediation (Stokoe, 2013b), primary healthcare (Heritage & Maynard, 2006) and benefits

claimants interviews (Drew, Toerien, Irvine & Sainsbury, 2014) have all been studied, and do

not form an exhaustive list. These settings share their institutional nature with the

constituency office. In this section, I will discuss three institutions that share some

similarities with the constituency office: the news interview and many news media broadcasts

in general share the presence of a political actor and the potential for representative work; the

doctor’s office and general practitioner interactions have a similar structure for

accomplishing service work; and the interactions with other social security agencies like

work assessment interviews share similar topics and resources. Although the similarity

between these institutions and the constituency office requires analytic comparison of data

and cannot be fully addressed in a discussion of literature, it is useful to mention the

institutions that share contextual details and interactional norms.

32

1.3.1 News interviews: Politicians in public

News media is one way that citizens observe and interact with politicians. News media can

include broadcast news shows on television and radio, interviews both live and pre-recorded,

‘phone-in’s or talk shows where citizens can direct comments and questions to hosts or show

guests, and panels or debates. Citizens can also form part of a ‘live studio audience’, who are

present for the recording (and sometimes broadcasting) of the show and may be able to

interact with the politician interviewees or panelists via questions, comments, and applause.

News media, however, has a specific set of features that are different from those at the

constituency office. While studies of news media provide some insight into how politicians

interact with and communicate to lay people, these studies cannot be a substitute for an actual

study of one-on-one constituency office interactions.

To begin with, the context for news media is different than at the constituency office.

By virtue of being broadcast, the media must be recorded in a certain way, which often

involves substantial editing (Eriksson, 2011). There are editorial decisions that impact what

version the public finally consumes, not to mention the editorial decisions involved in

determining an interview schedule, choosing angles and images, and even constructing or

choosing the setting (outdoors in the street, a studio with a news desk, a studio with leather

chairs, etc.) in which the broadcast is recorded (Ekström & Kroon Lundell, 2011; Eriksson,

2011), and these latter concerns affect even live broadcasts. At MP surgeries, citizens have

unedited and immediate access to their representatives, although during the rest of the time

access to the MP is mediated by the caseworkers.

But editing is just one example of how the ultimate recipients of the broadcast – the

public at large – influence the interaction. News media interactions are created to be

‘overheard’ or consumed by a large audience, often one that is not (entirely) physically

present for the interaction itself (Clayman & Heritage, 2002a). As Hutchby (2006, p.164)

writes, “…even when a show is produced in the presence of a studio audience, the audience

of viewers and listeners [‘at home’] remains a principal recipient toward whom the talk is

oriented.” Interviewers and interviewees use several interactional practices that are not

generally found in mundane talk: interviewers refrain from assessing and affiliating

utterances; interviewers refrain from giving news receipts such as ‘oh’; and interviewees

address each other in the third person (see Clayman & Heritage, 2002a, pp. 120-126;

Heritage, 1985). Furthermore, interviewers can use the audience’s presumed interest as an

account for asking aggressive or probing questions (Heritage, 1985). At the constituency

office, however, the MP and staff use practices that resemble the mundane version: they do

33

give news receipts and regularly assess utterances and affiliate with constituents (as in the

‘chat-like’ talk in Ekström, 2011), and constituents speak directly to the MP or caseworker,

rather than to the camera. The presence of the camera in this study does raise the question of

whether any participants presumed that they had an audience – namely me, the researcher.

However, there is little evidence of participants orienting to the camera and, moreover, the

participants would only be assuming a very small, restricted audience, instead of the large,

public audience that ‘overhears’ news interviews.

In terms of other interactional norms, news media have different ‘rules’ than what we

will see at the constituency office. Although journalists may purport to engage interviewees

in conversation, even a cursory analysis demonstrates that there are substantial differences in

how the interview interaction unfolds, as compared to mundane talk (Clayman & Heritage,

2002a, p.97). News interviews involve pre-allocated turns (Atkinson & Drew, 1979), in

which the interviewer is largely constrained to asking questions, and the interviewee to

answering questions, although there are some interviews that work to achieve a more relaxed

interactional structure (see Ekström, 2011). Departures from this norm are accountable (see

Clayman & Heritage, 2002a, 2002b), such as when politicians evade answering questions

(Bull, 2008; Ekström & Fitzgerald, 2014). It is also important to note that the average

citizens’ consumption of interactions with politicians is not via directly interacting with

politicians, but via mediated reception of other people’s interactions with politicians, such as

journalists and other politicians in debates. Although journalists may legitimize their work by

representing the public (see Clayman, 2002a), we cannot reasonably substitute the empirical

study of journalist-politician interactions for the study of citizen-politician interactions. The

constituency office is one of the only places where the average citizen can directly converse

with a politician, without the intervening mediation of news organizations, parliamentary

reports, or other specialists.

There are also the participants’ roles to consider: do they resemble the roles of the MP

and constituent? The journalist is at an interview on behalf of the public, purportedly to

represent the public’s interest in information. This can be seen in their efforts to maintain a

‘neutralistic’ or impartial footing (Clayman, 1992). The journalist must remain neutral in

order to best represent as much of ‘the public’, their audience, as possible. Major news

organizations have explicit guidelines about how to remain impartial (e.g., BBC, 2016;

Downey, Deacon, Golding, Oldfield & Wring, 2006 – although see Hutchby, 2011, on non neutral interviews), which manifest in several practices that interviewers use. For example,

interviewers change footing when introducing opinions or facts into an interview (Clayman,

34

1992). The impartiality of journalism is a major concern for research and for news

organizations, and is regularly studied (for studies with an interactional perspective, see

Ekström, Djerf-Pierre, Johansson & Håkansson, 2015; Heritage & Clayman, 2013, p. 498;

Huls & Varwijk, 2011; for studies with a media and communication studies perspective, see

Deacon, Downey, Stanyer & Wring, 2015; Downey et al., 2006; Stanyer, Deacon, Downey &

Wring, 2014). The politicians, on the other hand, have no such need to be impartial; indeed,

they often need to represent a particular perspective or bias. In news interviews, politicians

have a stake in getting their message across to a large audience. As Clayman and Heritage

(2002a, p.29) put it, “…journalists exchange [with politicians] access to publicity for the kind

of news content that will keep readers reading and viewers watching.” The exchange between

journalists and politicians is often portrayed as a struggle (Ekström, 2009; Ekström &

Fitzgerald, 2014, Ekström et al. 2015), during which journalists aim to get highly committed

statements from politicians, and politicians resist committing to specific promises while

getting their message out (Clayman & Romaniuk, 2011). This adversarial relationship is not

present during constituency office meetings in this thesis’ corpus. The MP and caseworkers

are not constrained to be as impartial as journalists, and while they occasionally ask

constituents to consider the other side (such as in neighbour disputes), they typically affiliate

with constituents’ concerns, and assess them as troubles to be solved. Nor do constituents

regularly attempt to discuss policy or get commitments from the MP on parliamentary voting

behaviour, and when constituents do discuss national politics it is a mitigated and delicate

affair (see Chapter 5). Overall, the constituency office shares few institutional rules or norms

with news interviews. MP surgeries provide an interesting contrast to the previous research

done in news settings, especially as the participants are not constrained by the same concerns,

such as the interview turn-taking format, or the need for impartiality. Furthermore, citizens

themselves are frequently absent from news interviews, unlike at the constituency office.

However, citizens are present in other public forums, such as town halls or mediated

interactions on radio and television. I briefly discuss this literature in the next subsection.

1.3.2 Citizens’ opportunities for talking to politicians

Citizens have little direct access to politicians outside of the constituency office; however,

they do have mediated access in several settings. First, I will discuss research that has

examined audience participation and radio- (or television-) phone ins, where hosts mediate

citizen questions to politicians. Second, I will turn to work on public meetings such as town

halls, where citizens publically deliberate policy and question local politicians.

35

A commonly used format in debate or interview media with politicians is a citizen

participation format. Citizens phone in, or form part of the live audience, and ask questions to

politicians. Hutchby (2006, p.64) writes that, “Audience participation debate shows provide a

public arena in which private citizens can express their opinions on issues in the public

domain.” One difference with the constituency office is that, like other news media, these are

public scenarios, often with large, national-scale audiences, whereas the constituency office

interactions are relatively private, involving only the constituents, the MP and their staff.

Citizens can, and do, participate indirectly via social media such as Twitter, both when

responses are solicited by the media broadcaster (Thornborrow & Fitzgerald, 2013) or when

not (Anstead & O’Loughlin, 2011), although this does not guarantee any response or

interaction with the politicians on the show. Another difference is that citizen participation

shows are mediated by a host or journalist. This has significant interactional implications

since, as Ekström and Eriksson (2013, p.197-198) point out, “It is the host and not the

questioner who decides whether the question has been answered or not.” Citizen access to the

politician is mediated by the host, and this mediation has increased over time in some areas

(Ekström & Moberg, 2015). Although citizens are encouraged to interact, their ability to

pursue concerns is limited (Lorenzo-Dus, 2011; Thornborrow & Fitzgerald, 2013, p.19-20).

As we will see, this is not the case at the constituency office, where citizens can pursue their

concerns at length (see Chapter 3), with much longer time limits, and without mediation.

Although Thornborrow and Fitzgerald (2013, p.25) hail citizen participation shows as “a

significant part of the political process where politicians can…be called to account”, they are

limited in their access to politicians. The constituency offers an interesting counterpoint as a

setting in which access is less constrained and mediated (although where the large public

audience is removed).

Access is also mediated, and strictly structured, at public meetings. At town halls

(Llewellyn, 2005), planning meetings (Mondada, 2015), school board meetings (Potter &

Hepburn, 2010a; Tracy & Durfy, 2007), and so on, citizens interact with each other,

deliberate on issues and decisions, and address concerns to politicians. Conversation analytic

work on public meetings has been concerned with how turns are allocated and contributions

managed (e.g., Mondada, 2015), but these are also settings in which it is possible to see

citizens interact with politicians. As with citizen participation shows, talk is often mediated

by a host or chair. Citizens also demonstrate much more hostility or adversarial qualities than

in the constituency office data (see Chapters 3, 5). Turns are is also more structured, with

citizens taking turns at microphones or by raising hands, which contrasts with the

36

spontaneous talk in the constituency office data. There is also more citizen-to-citizen

interaction in these public meetings than at the constituency office (Llewellyn, 2005), likely

due to the larger numbers of citizens present at any given time, or the citizen-discussion

nature of the topic at hand.

Again, as with news interviews, we see that these settings share the presence of a

politician with the constituency office, but otherwise differ significantly in the interactional

norms of the setting. This suggests that the constituency office is a relatively unusual political

setting, and further supports the need to investigate its interactional structures. Despite the

lack of the presence of a politician, the constituency office shares more interactional features

with doctors’ surgeries than with the above settings. This brings us to considering the most

studied service relationship in conversation analytic studies: medical interactions.

1.3.3 Medical interactions: The other ‘surgery’

Medical interactions and primary care interactions (see Heritage & Maynard, 2006) have the

most structural similarities to constituency office meetings. Even the term in British English

is the same: both doctors and MPs hold ‘surgeries’. Other institutional settings are not as

similar; for instance, interviews and courtrooms have much stricter templates for interaction

(e.g., question-answer rights, Clayman, 2006, p.136-137), and participants in police

investigations have a very different stake (Stokoe, 2013a) than constituents seeking aid.

However, the empirical similarities and differences are an analytic point to be proven and

discussed, which I will address in Chapter 3. The key point to establish at the moment is that

there are contextual differences that suggest the constituency office deserves separate

consideration, rather than being analyzed as a type of primary care interaction.

The first ‘stage’ in both primary care medical encounters and MP surgeries is typically

an information gathering stage, in which patients/constituents present concerns, and/or

doctors/MPs solicit those concerns (e.g., Robinson, 2006). Past studies have examined the

structural contingencies for requesting medical care (Heritage & Robinson, 2006), how

patients suggest candidate diagnoses (Stivers, 2002) or how patients demand certain

treatments (Gill, 2005; Stivers, 2005). Similarly, constituents give accounts for requesting aid

and for visiting the MP specifically among other potential services (see Chapter 3). However,

constituents in data collected for this thesis do not suggest ‘candidate diagnoses’ or potential

solutions (see Chapter 3), and regularly display uncertainty about whether their visit is

appropriate. Constituents question whether the MP can help them at all, and treat the

available services as unfamiliar. These practices resemble first calls to mediation, as reported

37

by Stokoe (2013b), in which callers regularly demonstrate their lack of knowledge about

mediation services at the opening of calls. Additionally, while patients go to the doctor as a

first-port-of-call, constituents (and mediation callers) frequently mention that they have tried

other services first, but have not yet found satisfaction. This corroborates findings by the

Young Legal Aid Lawyers (2012, 2013) that MPs are the last resort for constituents in need.

There are two further similarities between primary care visits and constituency offices.

First, doctors must often express empathy for patients’ troubles (Silverman & Peräkylä, 1990;

Maynard & Freese, 2012; Heritage & Lindström, 2012), as must caseworkers and MPs.

Second, doctors are considered knowledgeable experts in medicine (Pilnick & Dingwall,

2011). This is similar to MPs and caseworkers, although the staff at constituency offices must

deal with a much wider variety of issues. Doctors focus on medical issues, whereas

constituents visit their MP for a wide variety of topics, including benefits, housing,

immigration, medical problems, neighbours, local events, business concerns, and more (see

Chapters 3-6 for examples; Le Lidec, 2009; Norton, 1994).

Finally, there is a difference concerning the ‘purpose’ of the MP as compared to the

doctor. A doctor’s primary role is to see patients and give medical advice. An MP’s set of

“core tasks” (House of Commons Modernisation Committee [HCMC], 2007, p.56) is to

sustain and hold government to account, and to debate and agree on legislation in the House

of Commons (Barnes, 2011; House of Commons, 2010, 2013). It is uncertain how much this

‘role’ difference may affect constituency office interactions. All British MPs undertake

casework. It takes up the largest proportion of their time, which is something some MPs

resent (Gay, 2005; Korris, 2011; Loat & MacMillan, 2014; Wright, 2010). The debate over

MP priorities has been documented in a House of Commons investigation (HCMC, 2007)

regarding the role of the MP. It reports, “There must now be a real concern that MPs are so

focussed on the parochial that they have no time for the national, let alone the international,

picture” (HCMC, 2007). One testimonial to the investigation added, “What would do more

than anything else to strengthen MPs at Westminster would be to relieve them of some of

their (ever-growing) constituency duties…Even those MPs who agree that Westminster is

their primary role often find themselves forced to spend an unreasonable amount of time on

constituency casework…” (HCMC, 2007, Ev.18). This suggests that constituency casework

is an undesirable and time-consuming component of an MP’s job, which may or may not be

considered central to the MP’s activities. Constituents and MPs therefore may have a very

different relationship, and consequently a different expectation of the kind of aid that will be

requested or offered, when compared to patients and doctors, for whom aid is a primary and

38

expected part of the relationship (see Stivers, 2005, for an example of patient resistance when

doctors prescribe ‘watch and wait’ instead of drugs or treatments). This will be further

explored in relation to constituent requests in Chapter 3, but it is worth highlighting that there

are many reasons to expect differences between data emerging from a doctor’s surgery, and

data emerging from the surgery of an MP. I will now explore one final ‘type’ of institutional

encounter that we can expect to have similarities with the constituency office: ‘street-level

bureaucracy’.

1.3.4 Street-level bureaucracy: Social support delivered to citizens

Social services, such as tax assistance, loan agencies, and housing organizations, share

topical content with the constituency office. Both the MP surgery and these bureaucratic

agencies deal with citizens who are suffering from financial or social support difficulties. The

same litany of problems comes through their doors: housing, debt, claiming and being

assessed for benefits, housing, and so forth. People who work at social service delivery

agencies, also sometimes called ‘street-level bureaucracy’ (Lipsky, 1980), interface between

the agency and everyday citizens. Many of these agencies are run (sometimes indirectly) by

the government (such as the Work Capability Assessment centres in the UK, which assess

whether a citizen with a disability can receive public assistance funds, or must work),

whereas others (such as the Citizens’ Advice Bureau in the UK) are charities. Given the

topical similarities, it is worth discussing the literature that has examined these institutions.

Past studies have shown that the client, in social services settings, is in a difficult moral

situation (Cedersund, 2013; Hydén, 1999). Generally speaking, the client is in (financial)

difficulty, and in order to receive help he or she must argue that it is through circumstances

beyond their control. As Hydén (1996, p.858-859) writes, “the right to be a recipient of help

and support rests on the principle that such a right applies only to those individuals who have

not consciously or intentionally put themselves into a situation in which they become

dependent on the benevolence of others.” This results in clients either volunteering or being

required to give accounts for their present difficulties, and accounts for seeking aid. For

example, Ekström et al. (2013) report that student loan officials attempt to discover why

debtors are having difficulty repaying their loan, and Rostila (1997) reports social workers

using fishing devices to extract client narratives. Drew et al. (2010) also demonstrate that

clients provide accounts for resisting advice in work-focused interviews. Constituents at the

MP surgery likewise regularly give extended accounts of their difficulties, including accounts

for seeking aid, and accounts of self-help prior to seeking the MP’s aid (see Edwards &

39

Stokoe, 2007), although it is rare for the MP or caseworker to elicit accounts, suggesting a

different agenda than in medical care.

One substantial difference between many social services and the constituency office is

that the MP office stands to benefit from assisting constituents in a different way. Social

services are engaged in allocating scarce resources, and must do so fairly (Bruhn & Ekström,

2015), and be conscious of budget restrictions. Clients are thus placing a burden on the

service, even while using it for its institutional purpose. As Lee (2011) points out, most

services do not simply grant every request, but must screen requests for legitimacy. But for

commercial businesses, requests are beneficial, in that they provide business. It is a similar

situation for the MP. The MP is not bound to treating every case that arrives, but every time

the MP provides aid to a constituent, there is an increased likelihood that the constituent will

vote for the MP. This is the creation of the ‘personal vote’, discussed earlier in Section 1.2.1,

and it allegedly is the primary reason most MPs engage in casework (Butler & Collins, 2001;

Cain et al., 1987; Parker & Goodman, 2009). Despite the benefit that casework provides,

constituents still supply accounts for their presence, creating a rather paradoxical set of data,

in which constituents act as though they are burdening the MP, but the MP treats the

constituents as providing benefit. This will be explored in Chapters 3 and 4. For now, the

important point is that the constituency office has this potentially unique quality, compared to

other social services.

In summary, I have shown that the constituency office is an institution with unique

possibilities. It straddles the line between business and social service, depending on how

participants orient to the potential benefits and burdens. It runs itself as a ‘surgery’, much like

a doctor’s office, but deals with a much wider variety of issues. It is not the first place a

constituent goes when in need, but the last. It is not a public place in which to interrogate

politicians, but a place in which to use their connections and expertise. Most interestingly of

all, the constituency office is not the primary purpose of the MP’s job. While the MP’s role as

a politician may take centre stage in an interview, the MP takes on a new ‘role’ as a social

service official when meeting with constituents. There is much to investigate about the

constituency office that we have not yet seen in other institutions.

1.4 Summary and research questions

In this chapter, I have reviewed the literature that pertains to the current investigation of

communication between citizens and their elected representatives at the constituency office. I

have evaluated existing political communication studies and political discourse analysis, and

40

found their goals and results to date to be uninformative about the site in question. Prior

research on constituency casework has neglected the interpersonal conversations that take

place at the office, focusing mostly on election benefits and the ‘personal vote’. This all

suggests that there is much to examine in the conversational practices at the constituency

office.

Next, I reviewed the conversation analytic literature of institutions related to the

constituency office. I found that politicians’ talk has been examined while in public spaces

and news media, but not in one-to-one conversations with constituents. I have discussed other

institutions like doctors’ offices and social services and noted that there are both similarities

and differences, including the way the office is treated as a last-resort, and the way that it is

treated as a secondary part of the MP’s job. These are empirical points to be discussed further

in the analytic chapters, but it is worth noting, while discussing the relevant literature, that the

current institutional literature can be used as a scaffold, but not a replica, when analyzing

constituency office interactions.

To conclude this review, I will outline the research questions that have guided the

current thesis overall. I address these questions in the chapters that follow.

1)   How do constituents present their trouble to the MP and caseworkers? (See

Chapter 3).

2)   How do the MP and caseworkers respond to constituent troubles? (See Chapter

4).

3)   What is the overall structure of these encounters, from opening to closing?

(See Chapters 3 and 4).

4)   How does the MP’s political affiliation or status as a politician come to be

invoked in these interactions? (See Chapter 5).

5)   How does the MP build a personal vote, if at all? (See Chapter 6).

6)   How do constituents manage their relationship to the MP, as residents, voters,

and aid-seekers? (See Chapters 3 and 6).

With these research questions in mind, I now turn to discussing the methods with which I

approached these questions and this project.

41

Chapter 2:

Methodology

2.0 Introduction

In the previous chapter, I discussed the major gaps in the literature, particularly the lack of

research into conversations and interaction at the constituency office. We know very little

about how constituents interact with their Member of Parliament (MP), or how they seek help

at the constituency office. I outlined the goals of this thesis, which centre on not only

updating our knowledge of what constituency casework comprises, but moreover doing the

first analysis of the social organization of the constituency office, and how social actions like

requesting help are accomplished through interaction. In this thesis, I aim to develop a

detailed picture of communication between MPs and constituents, which requires analyzing

recordings of actual interactions between these parties. In this chapter, I will describe how I

collected the data corpus of audio and video recordings presented in this thesis. I will also

describe the participants, as well as how the constituency office is organized.

In Section 2.1, I will start by explaining what constituency offices are, and I will

distinguish between the three types of actors that are found there: MPs, caseworkers, and

constituents. Next, in Section 2.2, I will give a brief outline of the practicalities of data

collection (such as recruitment and equipment) and the composition of the corpus. I also will

describe the difficulty in acquiring participating offices. In Section 2.3, I will discuss the

ethical considerations raised by this research and how they were managed. Finally, in Section

2.4, I will explain the conversation analytic approach to analyzing the recordings, including

the transcription and analytic procedures of this method. Conversation analysis has guided

this project in many ways, from the collection of live conversations, to the analysis of the

data; an understanding of conversation analysis is essential to understanding the results of

this research.

2.1 Constituency offices

MPs in the United Kingdom (UK) are responsible for creating and modifying policies and

laws to govern the country. MPs debate which policies to adopt in the House of Commons.

MPs also scrutinize the governments’ decisions, and represent the citizens of their local

districts in the House of Commons. MPs differ widely in how they accomplish this

representation. Despite the differences (House of Commons, 2013; see Chapter 1, Section

42

1.2.1), all MPs in the UK claim to meet with the constituents they represent, and undertake

constituency casework.

At constituency meetings, constituents may offer criticisms of government policy or

opinions about law currently under debate (House of Commons, 2013), but most commonly

they ask for assistance with problems they are having. In order to maintain a local place of

work and a local point of contact in the constituency, MPs run constituency offices, and hire

staff to assist them there. These offices, and the interactions between constituents, MPs, and

staff that take place there, are the subjects of my research. In this section, I will outline the

different participants who appear at the constituency office, and how the office and surgeries

are structured.

2.1.1 Members of Parliament and constituency office surgeries

There are three types of participants at constituency offices: Members of Parliament,

caseworkers and constituency staff, and constituents. In this section I will describe each of

these participants, and their presence at the office., starting with the MP.

MPs are the elected representatives of the geographical area that is the constituency.

The boundaries are regularly redrawn to achieve a fair distribution of population, so that each

MP represents approximately the same number of a country’s citizens. In the UK, this is

approximately 90 000 constituents per MP (House of Commons, 2013). This equalizes both

the responsibilities of representation for the MP, as well as equalizing the ‘value’ of every

citizen’s represented vote in Parliament (although in practice the representation varies by

several thousand citizens: Gussow, 2012; Office for National Statistics, 2013). As part of

their role as representatives, MPs maintain contact with the citizens who elected them, and

since medieval times have offered help to individual constituents in need (House of

Commons Modernization Committee, 2007). The constituents are residents within the

constituency borders. The MP in this study represented a constituency of England in the

United Kingdom, and was a member of the political party that held the majority of

Parliamentary seats (and thus was the ‘government’ party) at the time of study. The MP will

otherwise remain anonymous.

MPs designate specific times to visit the constituency, since they spend most work

weeks at Parliament, in London (even if they are working on constituency casework via email

while in London: Korris, 2011). MPs are usually only available in the constituency on

Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. In the United Kingdom, it is expected that MPs run

‘surgeries’, weekly or biweekly meetings at their constituency offices, during which a

43

constituent can make an appointment to speak with their MP directly (constituents can also

speak to the MP’s staff during business hours all week, see ‘Caseworkers’ below). The MP in

this study ran surgeries approximately biweekly, although occasionally during the study

period there were additional surgery days offered on off weeks. Appointments for surgery

meetings are taken over the telephone on a first come, first served basis. These surgery

meetings run between ten to twenty minutes long, although they can be longer or shorter. At

the constituency office in this study, constituents were instructed that the meeting would last

approximately fifteen minutes, although this timeframe was treated as flexible during the

surgeries themselves. Some MPs will take surgery appointments all day, and some for a few

hours. The MP in this study allotted two to four hours per surgery day. The MP in this study

typically took eight meetings per surgery day, although sometimes constituents did not show

up for their appointments. Some MPs run surgeries during usual business hours, others on

weekends, and some (as with the MP in this study) in the evenings. Although these surgeries

are run so that constituents can see the MP in person, the caseworkers typically write the

necessary letters, or phone the appropriate agencies, to achieve the constituent’s desired

outcome.

2.1.2 Caseworkers

Caseworkers and constituency staff are non-elected people who work at constituency offices,

typically as employees of the MP. Occasionally caseworkers are volunteers, but the two

caseworkers in this study were full-time employees. Caseworkers provide support to

constituents, and typically spend the most time directly interacting them. At the constituency

office studied, the caseworkers were present during regular business hours (9-5, Monday to

Friday), as well as staying late on surgery days and attending certain special events on

evenings or weekends.

Experienced caseworkers are very knowledgeable about the services available to

citizens, and regularly interact with, and send constituents to, these other services, including

other government agencies, charities, and so forth. This included the UK’s Citizen’s Advice

Bureau, solicitors, and local councils. Caseworkers are able to access an MP hotline (in fact it

is predominantly the caseworkers who do this, not the MPs themselves, despite the title of the

service), which provides them with information about policy, regulations, options, and

specific case information. Caseworkers can also contact other governmental agencies

internally such as benefits divisions or pension services that constituents cannot access. For

example, caseworkers and MPs can call the UK Border Agency for information about

44

immigration cases, but there is no way for a member of the public to do the same. Some

offices divide casework according to topic (with one caseworker taking all of the ‘housing

issues’, another taking all of the ‘benefits issues’, etc.), and others, as with the surgery in this

study, take cases in a more ad-hoc fashion. Once a constituent’s case has been initially seen

by a caseworker, that caseworker typically manages all details of the case and is the main

point of contact for that constituent until the case is closed.

2.1.3 Constituents

‘Constituents’ are the residents of a ‘constituency’. A person may also be considered a

constituent if their business is located in the constituency, although such a person can only

contact the MP for business-related issues, and must contact their home residency MP for any

personal issues. Non-voting citizens are still considered constituents (in the UK, the voting

age is 18 years old), in that they are represented by and can appeal to the local MP. Non citizens (resident immigrants, for example) are not officially represented by the MP, but they

do still appeal to the constituency office for aid. The UK uses the electoral method of ‘first past-the-post’, in which constituents vote for representatives, and whoever earns the largest

total votes among the candidates is the winner. This means that a candidate does not need

more than 50% of the vote to win, only the greatest total, which could be – and regularly is –

only 30% or so of the votes. No matter how the constituent may have voted in an election,

they are represented by the winner, and may expect to be fairly represented in Parliament by

this winner. Constituents may also expect to be given aid by their MP, regardless of whether

they originally voted for that candidate. Although some constituents mention their support for

the MP’s party in my data corpus, the MP and caseworkers expressed that such statements of

support do not influence the aid offered. The constituency office will even help citizens who

have failed to vote at all; one caseworker mentioned that a constituent claimed to have voted

for the MP in the last election, but his voting record showed he had not voted. Caseworkers

can access the record of whether a citizen voted or not, but the vote choice remains a secret

ballot.

The constituents in the current study formed a diverse group, although they were all

from one constituency. My study did not record demographic information as such details

were taken to be irrelevant until explicitly discussed by constituents themselves in the surgery

meetings (see Section 2.4, Conversation analysis). Conversation analytic studies often take

this stance towards demographic information, so this is in keeping with the conversation

analytic tradition. However, a guide to the apparent demographics is in Table 2.1.

Constituents also brought a diverse number of issues to the constituency office, which

matches data collected in other studies of constituency offices (Cain, Ferejohn & Fiorina,

1987; Gay, 2005; Le Lidec, 2009; Norton & Wood, 1994; Rawlings, 1990a, 1990b). A

summary of the issues and topics that constituents brought to the surgery in the data corpus is

in Table 2.2.

Note: This table outlines the topics of concern for constituents calling or visiting the constituency

office. Only one category was assigned per call or appointment. Where interactions covered multiple

topics, the leading topic discussed was used. The ‘Other’ category includes: Repatriating a sick

relative, getting publicity for a petition, information on a school trip, taxes, and those unclear due to

brevity of call.

In this section, I have provided an overview of what a constituency office is and who its

regular participants are. Next, I will discuss what data was collected, and the logistics of data

collection and recruitment.

2.2 Data collection

In this section, I will discuss how participants were recruited (Section 2.2.1) and the

practicalities of collecting data (Section 2.2.2). I will describe how offices were recruited to

take part in the study, and the difficulty in finding interested and consenting offices. I will

also describe how individual constituents were recruited at the participating offices.

Subsequently, I will describe the practicalities of setting up the audio and video recorders. In

total, 12.5 hours of conversation were recorded. Five hours (58 interactions) were telephone

conversations, and seven hours (25 interactions) were video recordings of surgery meetings.

2.2.1 Recruiting the participants

Recruitment was divided into two stages: first, recruiting the MPs and office staff, and

second, recruiting the individual constituents.

The first stage of recruitment was to recruit a constituency office. For the first few

months of research, constituency offices were contacted by a mixture of letter, email, and

telephone calls, detailing the research and requesting to meet someone at the office to discuss

the possibility of making recordings there. Offices in the U.K. (national legislature of

Westminster, 203), Scotland (devolved legislature of Holyrood, 54), and Canada1 (national

legislature and provincial legislatures, with politicians from both Ontario, 50 and Québec, 59)

were contacted. 24 offices responded to initial contact, and two out of 366 offices agreed to

participate. Non-responding offices were re-contacted by email up to two more times, unless

a refusal occurred. Each office varied in its reasons for declining to participate, but the main

concerns were time commitment, legality, and privacy issues. One of the two participating

1 Given that I (the author) am Canadian, I was interested in how the countries compared. Both Canada and the U.K. use a similar system of government, but engage in different styles of constituency service. It also seemed wise to cast a wide net during recruitment, to maximize the chances of recruiting other offices.

47

offices (in Québec, Canada) dropped out of the study, leaving only one office in the UK

participating and contributing data to the final corpus.

Attempts to contact offices continued for eighteen months (2013-2014). At this point,

recordings were already underway at one office, so preliminary analysis and results were

available. In later attempts to recruit offices, these preliminary results were used as a ‘hook’

(see brochure in Appendix C): instead of asking to carry out research from the beginning,

meetings were scheduled with MPs in order to present preliminary findings that the offices

may have found useful. At these presentations, the possibility of participating in the research

project was broached. Although this method was much slower, more offices were willing to

have an initial meeting, making it possible to actually discuss participation with them. It was

clear from many rejections that the project was not well understood, as many offices cited the

inability to participate in ‘interviews’, which was not an accurate understanding of the

project. Using the preliminary results ‘hook’ was useful in passing these initial rejections, but

did not ultimately result in other recruitment.

Further attempts to recruit offices were made via constituents who volunteered to

contact their local MP and vouch for the project, and by writing to the Speakers of the

various legislatures (at the advice of the British Parliamentary officer Black Rod) to request a

discussion and potential publicity or official endorsement. As some rejections from offices

cited the ‘unacceptable’ practice of recording constituents, letters were also written to the

Canadian Privacy Commissioner and the UK Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. None

of these attempts at contact were successful, and none received a reply.

The second stage of recruitment involved requesting participation of constituents (see

Appendix B, for information and consent forms). This was done on a call-by-call, meeting by-meeting basis. When the constituents called the office or came to a surgery, they were

presented with the possibility of participating (see Section 2.3.1, Informed consent). Four

constituents declined to participate in video recordings (out of a possible 29), and three

declined to participate over the telephone (out of a possible 61 calls where informed consent

was requested). In other words, the vast majority of participants agreed to participate, and

most did so without asking any questions about the research (see Speer & Stokoe, 2014, for a

discussion of participants hurrying through the consent procedure). 11 calls were deleted due

to a failure to achieve informed consent.

48

2.2.2 Practicalities of data collection

Data for this research consisted of audio and audio-video recordings of Members of

Parliament, constituency office staff, and constituents. Audio recordings were made of

telephone calls. Audio-video recordings were made of surgery (i.e., face-to-face) meetings.

Once the office agreed to participate (see 2.2.1 Recruitment), the staff were briefed on the use

of the recorder (for a list of equipment, see Table 2.2). It was important that they could turn it

on and off, so that they did not record conversations without consent. Office staff were given

information sheets that they could keep by their desk to answer any questions that might arise

when asking permission to record.

For telephone calls, a digital recorder was connected through the telephone jack in the

constituency office. The audio recorder was connected to the telephone using a feed from the

telephone jack. A jack extension with a microphone feed was plugged into the audio

recorder. Audio recordings were made with a digital Olympus VN-8100PC recorder (see

Appendix D). The recorder was left at the desk of the caseworker, by the telephone, so that it

was easily accessible to turn on and off as required. The call taker, the caseworker, was

instructed to turn it on in the morning, and off at the end of the day. This was deemed easier

for the office staff than having to remember to turn on the call before answering the phone. It

was important that the openings of phone calls be recorded, as these can be very informative

(for example, see Schegloff, 1979), so it was necessary to have the recorder on all day to

avoid problems due to forgetfulness. The caseworkers were instructed to turn off the recorder

if a constituent declined to participate. The caseworkers were also able to exercise personal

judgment and not ask certain constituents to participate. The caseworkers were concerned

that some constituents were too distressed to participate, and so they sometimes chose not to

ask constituents to participate at all. Some calls were recorded without achieving informed

consent and these calls were deleted from the corpus before analysis.

When asking for constituents to participate over the telephone, operators were asked to

say, “Before we start, we are recording our phone calls for research and training purposes,

would you mind if this call is recorded, or would you like me to stop?” (For more on the

procedures designed to handle ethics and consent, see the Section 2.4, Ethics, below). For in person surgery meetings, I was present to ask constituents to participate, and offered

participants information sheets and had them fill out consent forms (see Appendix B for

copies of these documents).

During surgeries, constituents sat face-to-face with the MP and caseworker (see Figure

2.1). This made it difficult to capture faces from both sides of the conversation, and where a

49

choice had to be made between which side to record visually, constituents’ faces were

chosen. Not all surgeries occurred in the same geographic location. An MP regularly takes

surgeries around the constituency, especially if it is large, or comprises a set of smaller towns

instead of one city neighbourhood, and uses a local community venue. The researcher

attended each geographic location to set up the camera. Video recordings were made using a

Canon Legria FS306 recorder. The camera needed to be set up at least five feet away from

the speakers, so as to include as much context in the visual recording as possible (see Figure

2.1). Typically, it was placed on a nearby table, or on top of other office items, such as

photocopiers, stacks of books, or boxes. The video camera had a small, three-inch tripod that

allowed it to be installed on any fairly flat surface, and allowed it to be adjusted for angle and

orientation. Constituents’ faces were prioritized over the face of the MP (as seen in Figure

2.1), as there were a much larger number of constituents that participated and this contributed

to the variety in the corpus.

right) is of a surgery meeting. Each still is in a different location in the constituency. Left, the location

is at a community venue at a small town within the constituency. Right, the location is at the

constituency office itself. The constituents sit opposite the MP and caseworker at a table.

In the course of recording data, it was necessary to manage the concerns of confidentiality

and anonymity, which were assured during the recruitment process. As offices regularly dealt

with confidential information, such as National Insurance numbers, addresses, and sensitive

stories, confidentiality was a primary concern for offices considering participation. In the

next subsection, I will discuss my approach to the ethical issues raised by my project.

50

2.3 Ethics, Consent, and Confidentiality

The information discussed at constituency offices was frequently of a personal and sensitive

nature. People often discussed debt, ongoing arguments with spouses, family deaths,

neighbour disputes, and health problems. In this section, I will discuss how, following

standard procedures for the collection of data in the conversation analytic field, I strove for

an ethical collection of data. I will first discuss the informed consent procedures, and explain

my inclusion of certain recordings in my corpus that did not have ‘textbook’ consent. I will

then discuss the way that the data was anonymized and stored in order to maintain the

confidentiality of those that did participate. Finally, I will briefly note the withdrawal

procedure.

2.3.1 Informed consent

As recommended by the British Psychological Society (2010), I obtained informed consent

from every participant whose recording is included in my corpus. Each participant was

informed that they were being recorded for research, and training, and had the opportunity to

withdraw from the research immediately, during recording, or at any future point. For video

recordings of surgeries, the constituents were given an information sheet with more detailed

material about the research and their possible role, and a consent form, which gave them

options as to how their recording could be used (for these forms, see Appendix B). For

constituents that were not consenting, the video recorder was turned off. On the telephone,

the caseworker at the constituency office asked for consent at the beginning of the calls

(usually – see below), and turned off the recording device if the caller declined to participate.

The constituency office staff did not receive consent forms, as they had already been

intensively informed about the project and given the opportunity to withdraw. The

caseworkers and MP were told they could request any recording be deleted, or stopped at any

point. All the participants were over 18 years of age. This procedure conforms to the standard

ethical guidelines published by the British Psychological Society (2010), the American

Anthropological Association (1998), and the Canadian Psychological Association (2000), as

well as the Loughborough University Ethics Committee (2012).

2.3.2 Asking for consent midway through a call

Call takers occasionally forgot to ask for consent at the beginning of calls. This resulted in

calls where consent was requested towards the middle or end of the conversation. As pointed

out in Speer and Stokoe (2014) however, this does not necessarily make the recording

51

unethical; in fact, they showed that participants are better able to know to what information

they are granting access, since the conversation has already taken place and all possible

material for which consent might be necessary is already on the table. As long as the

constituent gave informed consent at some point during the phone call, the recording was

included in the corpus. When call takers forgot to ask for consent entirely (11 calls), the

recording was deleted.

2.3.3 Storing and anonymizing collected data

All collected recordings were kept on a password locked computer and/or encrypted hard

drive. Data logs that tracked participants’ information alongside recording code numbers held

unanonymized information, and were locked with another password.

For each recording, a transcript was made. All recordings and transcripts that were

made public, for example, in data sessions, conference presentations, or for publications,

were anonymized. This entailed the following:

1)   For transcripts,

a.   Personal names were deleted, along with addresses, phone numbers, personal

identity numbers such as National Insurance Numbers (UK), place names, and

any other potentially identifying information.

b.   These items were all replaced with pseudonyms.

2)   For audio material,

a.   Names, and all other information as above, were digitally silenced in the

recording.

b.   Voices had their pitch modified using Adobe Audition, to 3 semitones either

above or below the unaltered voice, whichever was more difficult to

recognize.

3)   For video material,

a.   Audio was modified as above.

b.   The entire visual recording was given a permanent filter using Adobe Premier.

This filter was an edge detector, which made all detail disappear from the

video, leaving only outlines. For an example, see Figure 2.2.

52

recording.

2.3.4 Withdrawal from the project

Participants were given the option to withdraw at any point. Constituents who had video

recordings done were given information sheets to keep so that they could contact the

researcher, me, at any point to withdraw and have all their material deleted. Constituency

offices likewise had this information and option, and could supply it to any constituent who

did not know how to get in contact with me. To date, no participants have withdrawn after

recordings were made.

I will now turn to the question of analyzing my data, by giving an overview of my

analytic framework: conversation analysis.

2.4 Conversation Analysis

In this section I will describe conversation analysis and the orders of interaction that it attends

to when analyzing recorded interactional data, as well as the conversation analytic approach

to its transcription. I will conclude the section with a step-by-step description of how I

conducted the data analysis.

2.4.1 Conversation analysis: Method and analytic framework

Conversation analysis (CA) arose as a way to understand human interaction and

conversation; to demonstrate “that and how” (Garfinkel, 1967, p.29) human interaction and

conversation were accountable and orderly to the participants of said conversations, and to

show that social science could thus be conducted in an empirical and scientifically rigorous

53

way (Sacks, 1992, p.11; Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson, 1974). Harvey Sacks, one of the

creators of this method, dismissed the then-popular belief that studying language had to entail

studying formulated phrases. Instead, Sacks took inspiration from ethnomethodologists, such

as Garfinkel (1967) and Goffman (1963), and focused on what Goffman called “the greasy

parts of speech” (1964, p.133), or everyday, ordinary conversational talk. Sacks argued

against social scientists of the day who “tended to view a society as a piece of machinery

with relatively few orderly products, where, then, much of what else takes place is more or

less random,” (Sacks, 1984a, p.21), demonstrating that there was ‘order at all points’ in social

life. The resulting discipline, conversation analysis, has as its goal:

to see how finely the details of actual, naturally occurring conversation can be

subjected to analysis that will yield the technology of conversation. The idea is

to take singular sequences of conversation and tear them apart in such a way as

to find rules, techniques, procedures, methods, maxims…that can be used to

generate the orderly features we find in the conversations we examine. (Sacks,

1984b, p.413)

In other words, CA is a means by which to analyze talk for its orderly components, and

through which to see how participants in conversations ‘do’ social things, and successfully

interact on a regular basis. CA has allowed scientists across many disciplines to understand

the orderly social life that pervades their study settings. For example, studies of telephone

calls have shown how participants display and know whether or not they are recognized by

their interlocutors (Schegloff, 1979); studies of courtrooms have shown how lawyers can

make implications about witnesses, and how witnesses resist these implications (Drew,

1992); studies of doctor-patient interactions have found a way to encourage patients to relate

all of their health concerns during a visit, instead of just one (Heritage & Robinson, 2011);

and there are many others. For my work, CA will help me to uncover, for example, how

constituents present themselves as ‘needing assistance’, how MPs offer help, how

caseworkers demonstrate that they are busy working on a case and that progress is being

made (or not), and how all parties orient (or not) to the fact that MPs are not simply

ombudsmen – they are politicians, with a perceived role in government.

The fundamental observation of CA is that talk is organized into turns (Sacks et al.,

1974), which are monitored by all participants to a conversation, so that the participants can

54

contribute at the appropriate time with the appropriate response for what they want to achieve

in talking. Besides organizing opportunities to participate in conversation (Lerner, 2004, p.4),

turns provide each speaker with an opportunity to accomplish actions, such as requesting,

giving news, greeting, complaining, suggesting, and many, many more. As Sidnell (2005,

p.207) writes, “Any phenomenon in ‘talk-in-interaction’ can be examined to see what job it is

doing.” The various findings since the inception of conversation analytic studies have

revealed how participants orient to these turns, such as where turns start and end, how

participants design turns, what components can be relevant for the interpretation of turns, and

how participants manage any difficulties that arise from using the turn-taking system. These

findings, what Sidnell (2010) calls “keys”, or what Heritage (2005) calls “resources”, can be

used as focal points for analyzing the data.

Turns provide a way to monitor the intersubjective understanding required for

coherency and mutual sense-making (Pomerantz & Mandelbaum, 2005, p.151). People who

engage in conversation continually coordinate their turns (Sacks, 1992, p.50), in order to

maximize this mutual sense-making. This coordination is achieved by designing turns, not

randomly or lackadaisically, to include specific features as required by the situation. Every

turn is designed to deal with whatever was made relevant by previous turns, and also makes

certain things relevant for the upcoming turn(s) by virtue of its design (Stivers, 2013, p.208).

Speakers monitor each other’s turn design for features that let them know at what point

they can begin their own turn (Sacks et al., 1974), for example, but they also monitor for

what a feature could be ‘doing’; speakers act as if they ask themselves “Why that now?”

(Schegloff & Sacks, 1973, p.299), ‘that’ being some feature of the prior turn. Knowing or

suspecting why a certain feature has been put into a turn gives people clues as to what action

the other speaker is doing, and the overall intersubjective understanding or sense-making in

the conversation is thereby continued.

In response to the prior turn, speakers produce what are often called ‘next actions’, or

an utterance that has been made relevant by the prior turn. In other words, interlocutors use

their turns to respond to prior turns, and address features or ideas that were brought up in the

previous speaker’s turn. As Heritage (2005, p.105) writes,

By producing next actions, participants show an understanding of a prior action

and do so at a multiplicity of levels – for example, by an acceptance, someone

can show an understanding that the prior turn was complete, that it was

addressed to them, that it was an action of a particular type (e.g., an invitation),

55

and so on. These understandings are (tacitly) confirmed or can become the

objects of repair [see below] at any third turn in an ongoing sequence …through

this process they become mutual understandings created through a sequential

architecture of intersubjectivity.

These actions and next actions, prior turns and next turns, come together to form sequences

of action (Schegloff, 2007), such as an invitation sequence, in which there is an invitation and

then an acceptance. The acceptance serves to confirm that many of the features of the prior

turn were understood and, further, the acceptance demonstrates to the conversation analyst

that specific features were understood and are being acted upon. These sequences can be

analyzed for how the speakers progress through the sequence, how they deal with any trouble

that arises in understanding or hearing, how they make the next item in the sequence relevant

and how they design turns to respond to relevant features. By inspecting turns, speakers can

understand themselves to be in the course of some sequence of action, such as ‘requesting the

salt’. Speakers can start sequences, and alter and end them. Sequences are “the vehicle for

getting some activity accomplished” (Schegloff, 2007, p.2).

I have mentioned several times now the possibility for ‘trouble’ to arise in conversing.

Trouble can be difficulties in hearing, or understanding a part of talk, or even a disagreement

or challenge to what was just said (see Jefferson, 2015). Built into the system that CA is

uncovering is a method for dealing with these problems and difficulties in maintaining

intersubjectivity: it is called repair (Schegloff, Jefferson & Sacks, 1977; Schegloff, 2007,

p.xiv). Repair is the practice of intervening in the current course of action to attend to a

possible trouble in speaking, hearing, or understanding (Kitzinger, 2013, p.229). Speakers

may repair any aspect of conversation that they believe has gone awry or created difficulty that has become a ‘trouble source’. Note that repair is different than correction; it is not

limited to difficulties that arise due to errors, nor is it based simply on replacing or altering

the trouble source to a ‘correct’ version (Schegloff et al., 1977, p.363). Repair provides

speakers with the ability to ‘fix’ misunderstandings and breakdowns in intersubjectivity that

would otherwise completely derail any mutual project of sense-making (which is what

conversation, after all, is). Repair provides analysts with insight into what speakers orient to

as trouble sources and what speakers consider to be crucial understandings for proceeding

with courses of action.

Finally, a recent focus of conversation analysis is the study of how participants claim

access to knowledge while interacting, and how these claims to access are supported or

56

disputed in talk, called epistemics (Heritage, 2013, p.370). One of the key components of

designing turns for one’s recipient is an orientation to what the recipient is supposed to know

about the world, and CA has shown a pervasive concern among conversationalists for

treating recipients of talk as sufficiently (or insufficiently) knowledgeable (see Enfield &

Stivers, 2007; Heritage & Raymond, 2005). This has significant consequences for how turns

can be designed, such as incorporating the appropriate degree of an ‘epistemic claim’, or a

claim inherent in the talk to knowing some detail, and for the responses to talk that follow,

such as making a stronger claim to knowing that detail, and implying that the previous

speaker should be careful not to claim too much knowledge.

These are the core resources that have been discovered to date in CA, and each is

important for analyzing a segment of talk. Next, I will discuss how I analyzed the data, using

these core findings as tools to uncover the order present in the recordings.

2.4.2 Transcription and analysis

Once the data were recorded, they were transcribed using the Jefferson system of transcript

(see Appendix A). This system uses normative spelling of a language with significant

alterations to demonstrate lengthening, pauses, breathing, laughter, and much more. It is the

standard method of transcription for CA, and focuses on precise details available in the

recordings. Transcripts were updated as the researched continued, as there is never the

possibility of including everything that potentially could be relevant for each stage of analysis

(Hammersley, 2010, p.566).

In analyzing recordings, I used the conversation analytic concepts outlined above as

perspectives from which to consider the talk in its context. Conversation analysis is generally

regarded as an inductive method, which rejects applying theories or categories to data that

were determined a priori, especially sociological attributes such as gender, ‘power’, or

psychological concepts such as goals (Potter & Hepburn, 2007; Schegloff, 1996, p.172).

From the early days of research, conversation analysts have promoted an ‘unmotivated

looking’ at the data, at least initially, to see what patterns and features are apparent (Jefferson

& Lee, 1992, p.521; Sacks, 1984a, p.27). Subsequently, all instances of the potential feature

are ‘collected’ together for scrutiny. For example, to analyze offers, I collected every instance

in which one participant offered something to another, and compared the instances for

intrinsic similarities. I examined where offers appeared in sequences, and how the turn that

built the action was designed. What was the turn in question making relevant for the next

turn? What epistemic stance or status was the participant doing the offering claiming or

57

displaying? How did the recipient of the offer interpret it? Did they accept it, repair it, and

what preferences and epistemic claims did they incorporate into their response?

Using the ‘next-turn proof procedure’ (see Heritage, 1984, p.245; Sidnell, 2013, p.79 80), in which analysts understand what a turn has accomplished via the displayed

interpretation (by the interlocutor) embedded in the subsequent turn, I worked through each

instance of a given feature. With each case that deviated from the pattern under scrutiny, I

examined how it deviated, and possible explanations for the difference. Deviant cases, in CA,

are not treated as necessarily disproving the existence or persistence of a practice. Instead,

deviant cases are treated as potentially providing additional evidence for the circumstances

under which a practice is used; these cases can actually be more revealing of the participants’

orientations to the practice (Sidnell, 2009, p.16).

As mentioned previously, my data are ‘naturally occurring’, which is precisely the kind

of data for which CA was designed. CA was developed on conversations that happened

naturally in the real world, ideally without researcher interference. CA is meant to uncover

the natural, everyday way that people talk, in contexts they would inhabit whether or not the

researcher even existed. Experiments and interviews interfere with the scientific discovery of

how actual social life unfolds by putting participants into a research context, and pre specifying what is important to ask and test. Natural data (or ‘naturalistic’, a term meant to

indicate that participants are aware of being recorded, and thus may alter their behaviour in

unspoken orientation to the fact of being recorded, see Potter, 2012b, p.438, p.445) has the

benefit of permitting access to what people do in the setting of interest, rather than what they

say they do or did (Potter & Hepburn, 2007; Potter, 2002; Sidnell, 2013), and rather than

focusing on what the researcher thinks must have been important. It also permits the analyst

to view interactions and aspects of life that would have occurred with or without the presence

of the researcher; that is, it passes the “dead social scientist test” (Potter, 2002, p.541). This

aids in understanding what happens for participants in that context, because we see it happen,

and because it would have happened anyway. Thus the CA approach was preferable to

interviews, as my researched aimed to explore the world of the constituency office as it

occurred for participants, and as it occurred everyday well before and after my study.

Interviews would have reduced my data to a set of responses to questions that I created, with

my own biases and concepts of social life, and this would not have captured the way that

people interacted in situ, nor would it have captured anything beyond the recollections and

opinions of participants. Following the CA approach, I wanted to research the social world as

it happens, not as it was remembered, and not through a filter of my own creation.

2.5 Summary

In this chapter I have described and explained how I collected the data to examine my

research questions, their context and background. I have discussed the procedures I used for

recruiting participants, the difficulties in getting constituency offices to participate and the

relative ease of getting constituents to participate. I have shown that my ethical procedures

for recruitment, anonymization, and storage, following standard and established norms. Most

importantly, I have given an overview of the analytical process of conversation analysis.

I will now turn, across the next four chapters, to addressing my research questions and

presenting the results of my analysis. I will present each finding in the order in which it

typically appears in a surgery meeting or phone call. Therefore, I will begin, in Chapter 3, by

examining the stories, troubles-tellings, and ‘requests’ that constituents present at the early

stages of interaction. Following this, Chapter 4 will examine the offers that caseworkers and

the MP made. Chapter 5 will examine the way that political topics were made relevant to the

interaction. Chapter 6, finally, will address how the MP, caseworkers, and constituents build

‘rapport’, and how ‘rapport’ may be an unhelpful concept for approaching communication

training. Using the conversation analytic methods described above, I will bring new insight

into communication practices at the constituency office.

Chapter 3:

Building a case for aid

3.0 Introduction

In the previous chapters, I established the need to examine the interactions that happen at the

constituency office of a Member of Parliament, and I described how I collected this data. I

will now begin analysis of the data corpus. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate how

constituents present their needs during constituency office encounters. Although the

prototypical way for clients to communicate needs in a service encounter is through a request

(Drew & Couper-Kuhlen, 2014), at the constituency office, I found that there are no direct

requests for service. Instead, constituents present their problem with narrative descriptions of

their problems, and these descriptions achieve recruitment (Kendrick & Drew, 2016).

Constituents’ narrative descriptions simultaneously manage several interactional challenges

as well as incrementally provide evidence for needing assistance; as such, the descriptions

build the case that constituents need aid. The process of doing the narrative descriptions, and

negotiating services, takes up the majority of each interaction at the constituency office. As a

result, in addition to analyzing the process of ‘building a case’, this chapter will also give an

overview of the overall structure of constituency office encounters. To achieve this, I will

regularly return to a single case (first seen in Extract 3.2), so that the reader can see how

these issues develop over a single encounter. I will also use extracts from across the corpus,

to show that the analytic points are consistently patterned in the data.

First, in Section 3.1, I will outline how participants begin the business of institutional

talk. The constituency office staff begin encounters with the phrase “How can I help”, and

constituents respond with a projection of an upcoming long turn. Next, in Section 3.2, I will

show that constituents present their problem through a narrative description, rather than a

request or a short ‘gloss’ of their difficulties. These are descriptions of the difficulties that the

constituents have faced, leading up to their decision to contact the MP. Zimmerman (1992)

has called these ‘narrative descriptions’, and finds that they are implicative of a request (see

also Drew & Walker, 2010; Gill, 2005). The narratives are more extended than those reported

in previous studies on emergency calls (e.g., Zimmerman, 1992) or doctors’ offices (Stivers,

2002), typically lasting up to ten minutes. I will demonstrate how constituents design their

narratives to display previously well-documented institutional features such as relevancy,

legitimacy, and reasonableness. Both the constituents and the constituency office staff

60

manage the overarching relevance of what is actionable about the constituents’ narrative (via

possible means of assistance, such as offers or advice). Following this, in Section 3.3, I will

examine what happens after a first offer of assistance has been made – namely, that

constituents continue to build the case for receiving assistance, but make the complaint aspect of their difficulty more and more overt. The constituency office staff also shift their

talk after the first offer, focusing more on affiliating with constituents’ complaints. Choosing

affiliation as the relevant next turn removes the relevance of an offer, which is one way that

constituency office staff can manage (and implicitly instruct) what is actionable. Finally, in

Section 3.4, I will consider the omni-relevance of offers, and how all participants orient to the

offers when they are absent.

3.1 Opening official business: How can I help?

In this section, I will analyze how the constituency office encounters open. First, I will focus

on the opening turns of the MP or caseworker (CW), which usually consist of the phrase

‘How can I help’. I will show the way that the constituents respond to this standard opening –

usually, with a turn that attempts to secure an opportunity to tell a narrative. I will contrast

this with other styles of client openings at institutions, particularly the ‘gloss’ or ‘request’

format that directly conveys what the client wants or needs, as well as showing other

examples of non-‘direct’-style openings in institutions such as emergency calls or helplines.

The purpose of this section is to show how participants ‘end up’ in the initial narratives that

constituents tell: what work brings them there. I will also discuss the ‘unknown’ nature of the

institution, in which constituents display evidence they are unfamiliar with the institution and

its services. Stokoe (2013b) has found that there are certain institutions, such as family

mediation, that are less well known by the general public. As a result, clients may face

additional challenges when seeking services, given that the details of those services (what

they are, who provides them, how they are accomplished, etc.) are uncertain or unknown. The

consequences of the ‘unknown’ nature will be more crucial in the next section (Section 3.2),

but some of the evidence for the unknown nature is present in the initial turns in office

encounters.

Most, although not all (see Extract 3.7), encounters at the constituency office begin

with the phrase ‘How can I help’ (or a variant), as can be seen in the following standard

phone call opening (for transcription symbols, please see Appendix A):

61

Extract 3.1: MP01.Phone-1KK_01

1 CW: Michael hJohnson’s office hAnn: speaki:ng how can I help you. This phrase is also used in surgery openings, as in the following: Extract 3.2: MP01.Surgery-1KO_01 1 MP: So. (0.2) How can we:: °how can we help.°

Note that ‘How can we help’ is used as well as ‘How can I help’. The ‘we’ is more

frequently used in surgery meetings, because there is more than one person present (the MP

and the caseworker are with the constituents), whereas on the phone there is only one person

speaking for the institution. However, both the MP and caseworkers occasionally use the

institutional ‘we’, wherein ‘we’ refers to a singular person as part of a larger institution.

‘How can I/we help’ is also used to convey the ‘official’ start to the encounter, by

(re)starting the institutional business after a period of non-institutional talk, or after asking

for consent to record the call. Such a ‘restart’ is seen in Extract 3.3, where the caseworker

(CW) does a standard telephone opening, but then is interrupted by needing to ask for

consent to record.

Extract 3.3: MP01.Phone-1KS_02 1 CW: Jacob hMoore’s office, hAnn: speaking,=how can I help you. 2 (0.8) 3 C: Hello, Uhm Ann, this is- it’s uh- Good morning.=Yes.=I 4 am calling from::: Benin Socio-association?= 5 CW: .hhh hOh: hello there, .hh Uhm can I just let you know ((3 lines omitted, asking consent to record)) 9 CW: [Oh, super. Okay, so you’re from the Bee Ess Ay, Hello, 10 (0.4) 11 C: eYeah. (1.3) Hello- Yeah, (0.4) So you know the Bee- 12 #uh- hh# Hello, 13 CW: Hi. How can I help,

The constituent displays some confusion in how to restart the call, and possibly a concern

that the phone call has been dropped (by reissuing the greeting, Line 12). The caseworker

(CW) orients to this difficulty by first confirming her presence (reissuing the return greeting)

and by re-starting the call, by repeating ‘How can I help’ (Line 13). This repetition shows

how participants orient to ‘How can I help’ as a way to (re)start official matters.

62

It is common for ‘How can I help’ (as well as other, hearably ‘standard institutional’

openings, such as ‘Dr. Jones’ office’ or ‘Midcity emergency’, see Sikveland et al., 2016;

Zimmerman, 1992) to elicit glosses or requests. For example, in emergency calls, one might

respond “I need the paramedics please”, (Zimmerman, 1992, p.436) or in calls to a flight

sales centre, “Yes I’d like to make a reservation for a flight ticket please?” (Lee, 2009,

p.252). When making these initial responses, participants can design their turns to convey

the degree of entitlement they have to make the request, and the degree of contingency

required to fulfill it (Curl & Drew, 2008). Participants also display their familiarity with the

services available (requestable) at the institution. However, there are many examples of

institutional encounters where the client begins differently, with a bid for, or preface to, a

narrative, and subsequently the narrative itself. For example:

Extract 3.4: MCE 20 15:207 (from Zimmerman 1992, p.438) 1 CT: Midcity police an’ fire 2 C: Hi um (.) I’m uh (.) I work at thuh University 3 Hospital and I was riding my bike home 4 tanight from (.) work- 5 CT: Mm 6 C: bout (.) ten minutes ago, .hh as I was riding 7 past Mercy Hospital (.) which is uh few blocks 8 from there .hh ( ) um ( ) I thinkuh couple vans 9 full uh kids pulled up (.) an started um (.) 10 they went down thuh trail an(h)d are beating up 11 people down there I’m not sure In emergency calls, it is common for callers to open by requesting a service or help. In

Extract 3.4, the caller directly begins a narrative, “I work at thuh University Hospital” (Lines

2-3). This is achieved by referencing their own positioning to the event, and leading those

details into a description of a possible trouble and emergency-worthy event (Zimmerman,

1992, p.438-439). This style of opening has also been seen in helplines (“I’m concerned

about…”, Potter & Hepburn, 2003, p.204), service centres (“I’ve installed office ninety

seven and…” Baker, Emmison & Firth, 2001, p.51), and in calls to mediation centres (“I’ve

been talking to somebody else, I don’t think there’s anything that you might be able t-”

Stokoe, 2013b, p.292). It is difficult to assess how, or if, clients are designing entitlement

and/or contingency into their turns when an overt request does not occur. Whereas earlier

examples displayed a minimum entitlement to make the request at all (‘I need the

paramedics please’), these examples circumvent putting a request on record, while still

achieving recruitment and making a transaction of assistance relevant (Kendrick & Drew,

63

2016). The same lack of requests is seen in the data in this thesis. There are three potential

reasons for constituents to avoid overt requests. First, Stokoe (2013b, p.293) has

demonstrated that clients may choose this style of opening as part of conveying that an

institution (and its remit) is unknown. Second, Heritage and Clayman (2010, p.76) have

noted that the narrative design is “particularly useful for ambiguous troubles whose

actionability may be subject to doubt.” Finally, many constituents in this data in this thesis

have tried to get help from several different institutions and received different advice. At this

point, it may be unclear what possible courses of action there are, let alone whether those

courses of action are actionable, or whether the constituency office as an institution will

attempt them. I will demonstrate these aspects (the unknown nature, the uncertainty of

actionability, and the uncertainty that the constituency office itself will help) in the

remainder of this section.

Let us return to Extract 3.2, which is a recording from a surgery meeting, and a face to-face encounter with the MP and caseworker (CW). The constituent (C1) has come to the

constituency office because he has been assessed as ‘fit for work’, meaning he is no longer

eligible for disability state benefits. Although he is appealing this decision, the appeal has

been repeatedly delayed, and as a result his benefits were cancelled anyway.

Extract 3.5: MP01.Surgery-1KO_01 (continued from Extract 3.2) 1 MP: So. (0.2) How can we:: °how can we help.° 2 (0.9) 3 C1: Well, (0.9) I had ay: (0.4) assessment’hh. (0.9) 4 Eighteen months ago, 5 MP: Right, 6 (0.9) 7 C1: Which stated that I was (0.3) fit an’ capable, (0.6) For 8 work.= 9 MP: =Right, In Line 3, C1 begins his turn with ‘Well’, displaying that he is orienting to the non-action

confirming nature of his turn (Heritage, 2015): he is not giving a direct answer to the ‘How

can we help’ opening. C1 then projects his narrative by mentioning that an event occurred

eighteen months ago. This opening, by referencing a past event, necessarily raises the

question of why such an event is relevant to the interaction now (Grice, 1975). It projects

that C1 will explain or demonstrate the relevance of the past event, but requires the talking

space to do so. The MP aligns with this projection; in saying ‘Right,’ (Line 5), he indicates

his understanding that C1 has begun to do a telling, and that there is more to come. The

64

MP’s turn also passes on taking a substantial turn himself, effectively granting talking space

to C1. These opening sequences are common in the corpus, as in the following encounters.

Extract 3.6 involves a constituent (C) contacting the office to get help with a medical

malpractice issue.

Extract 3.6: MP01.Phone-1KK_03 1 CW: Michael Johnson’s office hA:nn speaking how can I help you. 2 C: °Hello there.° uh: I’ve been tryin’ to send an email (.) 3 uh:m but it keeps coming back as postmaster at mac dot com: 4 uh delivery failed,= 5 CW: =.hhH Ri:ght okay .hh uhm >just before we go on any<mo:re ((4 lines, asking consent to record)) 10 CW: Oh great. Thank you. .hhH Right. So are you trying to email 11 Michael or: me or 12 C: Uh well y- uh-uh I don’t really know >to be honest< I’m- I’m 13 it’s >a bit of< uh: (0.5) bit of a brick wall. 14 CW: Okay? .hh How can I help then. 15 C: °Well° basically what it is uhm: a-bou:t I-I suffer from uh- 16 a disease called ankylosing spondylitis. 17 CW: Yeah? C’s initial concern is that his email keeps bouncing, as he was attempting to email (rather

than call) the office. After dealing with the consent question, and determining that C is

uncertain who to contact, CW reinitiates the ‘How can I help’ statement (Line 14). C now

follows the usual pattern: the well-prefaced turn (Line 15) indicates both a bid for a longer

turn, and non-conformity to the ‘How can I help’ adjacency pair. C uses another set of

practices common in the data corpus, prefacing his turn with ‘basically’ and ‘what it is’

(Line 15). These statements continue to show C’s orientation to presenting a difficulty, but

needing more turn space to explain it. Inevitably, these phrases will not preface a gloss in

this data corpus (such as ‘basically, I’m dealing with medical malpractice and I need help

with X’), but instead serve to tie contextual details to the difficulty. Prefacing the contextual

details with ‘basically’ conveys the sense that these details are necessary preliminaries for

stating the difficulty itself. CW aligns with C’s bid for a turn, saying ‘Yeah?’ (Line 17). This

serves to show that CW is passing on taking a turn, and that she is expecting more to come.

Similarly, in Extract 3.7, CW treats C’s explanation as in-progress. Extract 3.7 is another

telephone call to the office.

Extract 3.7: MP01.Phone-2AH_02 1 CW: Good morning Jacob Moore’s office, 2 C: Oh good morning,=Yes. Uhm, I wrote to Jacob Moore recently 3 about a problem that (.) my daughter was having. .hh Uhm,

65

4 (0.8) 5 C: We- we- (0.3) <We’re not sure how things work> with, >e- 6 but- m-< .hh She At the moment she’s Uhm, out of work. 7 She’s= 8 CW: =[Okay, ] 9 C: =[out of] work at the mom[ent.] 10 CW: [Yea.] (.) Yea. CW gives continuers (Lines 8 and 10) that align with C’s turn as a narrative, and as part of

talk that has not yet arrived at an actionable difficulty. C begins her turn with contextual

details (‘At the moment she’s uhm, out of work.’, Line 6). These details are necessary

preliminaries for building a case for the constituent needing aid, and incrementally work

towards achieving recruitment of assistance (see Section 3.2 on how these details achieve

recruitment of assistance). In fact, although they could be called ‘preliminaries’, this implies

that something different or some ‘main’ component is upcoming (like a request). As I will

continue to show (see Section 3.2), these initial narratives are not preliminary at all (nor are

they ‘pre’s – see Section 3.2.2). Launching into description both bids for space to tell a

narrative, and begins the narrative itself. As long as the caseworkers show alignment with

this action, the constituents continue their description of difficulties. There is no later request

or ‘main’ component to which these descriptions are preliminary.

Extracts 3.6 and 3.7 also show evidence of what Stokoe (2013b, p.293) calls ‘unknown

institutions’. There are, at a minimum, uncertainties expressed, and at maximum, ignorance

about what the constituency office does and or is willing to do. Both cases show the

constituents saying they are uncertain: ‘I don’t really know >to be honest<’ (Ext. 3.6, Line

11) and ‘<We’re not sure how things work>’ (Ext. 3.7, Line 5). These expressed

uncertainties do more than portray the ‘inner thoughts’ of the constituent (if they do that at

all: Potter, 2012b); they account for the constituents’ calls, and help in the process of

recruiting assistance (Kendrick & Drew, 2016, see Section 3.2) by making it relevant for the

MP or caseworker to offer assistance. However, the constituents’ turns also suggest a lack of

familiarity with the office and its procedures, such as not knowing who to email (or possibly

not knowing that there was more than one person to email) in Extract 3.6 (Lines 9-12), or, in

Extract 3.7, expecting to be recognized merely by stating that one has written recently about

a problem (Lines 2-3). There is further evidence, such as constituents frequently mentioning

being referred from a third party agency or friend, seen in Extract 3.8 below.

Extract 3.8: MP01.Phone-2AH_04 1 CW: .hhh Jacob Moore’s office, hGail: speaking, How can I help

66

2 you. 3 C: Aoh hello Gail:,=I was htold to ring you by a friend a’ mine 4 <Robert Clements.> On Line 4, C mentions that he was referred to the office by someone who is already a

‘client’ of the office. As Stokoe (2013b) discusses, such comments indicate that constituents

do not go to the constituency office as a first port-of-call, as the go-to agency for their

difficulty (corroborated by Young Legal Aid Lawyers, 2012). Constituents are referred to

the office by other agencies or by acquaintances. These utterances also account for calling,

especially in a sequentially early position (Schegloff, 2007), as in Extract 3.8. In calls to

mediation services, such mentions make it relevant for the call taker to explain the services

offered (Stokoe, 2013b). At the constituency office, the staff never offer an explanation of

services unless explicitly requested. As a result, constituents do not end up being officially

informed of what services are actionable or requestable (this may be due to the very wide

diversity of problems that the constituency office addresses). The consequences of

constituents remaining relatively uncertain or uninformed about the services offered at the

constituency office will be seen in how they design their ensuing turns.

In this section, I have shown that the constituency office staff begin the encounters

with a standard institutional greeting, usually ‘How can I help’. Constituents respond by

opening a narrative sequence, through referring to contextual details and using other turn

design elements such as ‘Well…’ or ‘what it is…’ that project longer turns. Constituents do

not typically begin with requests or direct statements of needs. This mirrors certain openings

of other institutions where the reason-for-calling has some element of dubious actionability

(Heritage & Clayman, 2010). I have also shown that, in the initial turns, constituents betray

evidence that they are uncertain of or uninformed about the services offered by the

constituency office. This ‘unknown’ nature of the institution (Stokoe, 2013b) has

consequences for how constituents design their ensuing narratives. In the next section, I will

analyze how constituents design their ensuing narratives about their difficulties, which were

projected by their initial turns.

3.2 Constituent narrative descriptions and building a case for assistance

In this section, I will analyze what happens once constituents have secured the floor to talk

(as described above in Section 3.1). Constituents launch a detailed description of the

circumstances that have preceded their visit to the constituency office. These descriptions

are quite extended, lasting up to ten minutes, and typically involve an explanation of the

67

history of the problem – as such, they are ‘narratives descriptions’ (Halkowski, 2006;

Zimmerman, 1992). In this section I will show that narrative descriptions achieve

recruitment (Kendrick & Drew, 2016) of an offer of assistance, but they are not direct

requests. I will also show that, as found in previous studies, constituents do work in these

narrative descriptions to show that their problem is legitimate, and that they are reasonable

citizens in unreasonable circumstances. Constituents occasionally do work to show the

relevance of their case for the constituency office, but more often they do work to show how

all other possible institutions are irrelevant. While highlighting these aspects of their

difficulty, constituents avoid the action of complaining, by avoiding putting their stance

towards an issue on record (Drew, 1998). Finally, I will discuss the challenges that

constituents manage by doing these practices, namely the issues surrounding the ‘unknown’

nature of the institution, and potential contingencies (Curl & Drew, 2008) involved in

procuring assistance. Although this section draws on past conversation analytic studies of

institutional environments, and shows many features that confirm previous findings, it is

necessary to analyze this material in order to understand how these details are used at the

constituency office specifically, as well as to explain the unique interactional challenges at

MP surgeries that are managed by these practices.

The constituent narratives focus on portraying the constituent’s problem as legitimate

and relevant. Previous studies have shown that these two issues are regularly the most salient

for seeking help from an institution. To portray the problem as legitimate, clients at an

institution need to show that they are reasonable people (Curl & Drew, 2008; Stokoe &

Hepburn, 2005), often facing unreasonable and severe difficulties (Stokoe, 2003; Heritage &

Robinson, 2006), and that they have already taken appropriate measures to help themselves

(Edwards & Stokoe, 2007). To portray the problem as relevant, clients do work to

demonstrate how their difficulty is relevant to the institution in question, such as showing

that the problem is ‘doctorable’ (Heritage & Robinson, 2006), ‘mediate-able’ (Edwards &

Stokoe, 2007; Stokoe, 2013b), or ‘policeable’ (Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990). These

interactional achievements (legitimacy, relevance) are cross-cutting and overlapping, as a

turn or utterance can do work to demonstrate both relevance and legitimacy; for instance, a

turn demonstrating the severity (and thus legitimacy) of an issue can also demonstrate the

relevance of seeking expert help, or the reasonableness of the client who has put up with the

problem until now. Overall, as previous studies have described (Schegloff, 1991, p.59;

Heritage & Clayman, 2010, p.76), this work builds a sense of actionability: of the potential

to do something about the issue.

68

Simultaneously, the initial narratives work to make an offer of assistance relevant. In

other words, the narratives do work that regularly achieves ‘recruitment’ (Kendrick & Drew,

2016) that makes an offer of assistance a relevant response. The demonstration of need has

been shown in several studies to be sufficient to make giving assistance relevant (e.g., Gill,

Halkowski & Roberts, 2001; Kendrick & Drew, 2016; Sidnell & Enfield, 2014; Sterie,

2015), and it is the same with constituency office encounters. Drew (1984, p.131) has also

found that “by just reporting some activities/circumstances, speakers can get recipients to

make proposals for arrangements arising from what is reported”; giving details (or narrative

descriptions, here) promotes the relevance of handling the upshot of those details. The

constituents rely almost exclusively on recruitment as a means to getting assistance; there

are almost no overt requests in the corpus. The few direct requests that exist are for low

contingency, local issues, such as ‘I want you to please just listen’ or ‘I’d like to use you as a

sounding board [for an idea]’, which can be satisfied immediately and often involve no

change in course of action (i.e., the MP was already listening, see Steensig & Heinemann,

2014 for an opposite situation). I will show how lengthy narrative descriptions build a case

for aid, and achieve recruitment.

In Extract 3.9, I return to the case previously mentioned in Extracts 3.2 and 3.5. The

constituent (C1) is visiting to get help with fixing a date for his appeal, which has been

delayed, and to get his benefits reinstated.

Extract 3.9: MP01.Surgery-1KO_01 (continuing Extracts 3.2 & 3.5) 1 MP: So. (0.2) How can we:: °how can we help.° 2 (0.9) 3 C1: Well, (0.9) I had ay: (0.4) assessment’hh.

I’m now on progressive.= 50 MP: =Right.= 51 C1: =Cause I am just [(#slowly getting worse# ) 52 [((truck goes by outside, 2.6)) 53 MP: Well I am- I’m so- (0.3) Well- an’ I think- (0.3) uhm, if 54 we: were to take, >your what, your reference numbers and 55 everything [else,< ((addressing CW2)) ((29 lines omitted, continuing to describe who they will call, what they are offering)) The core of C1’s difficulty appears in Lines 15-19. Here, C1 contrasts the ‘dear lady’ with

his doctor. The turn categorizes this person as probably not expert or professional (as

opposed to his doctor, who is both). She made her assessment of C1 in only ‘twenty

minutes’ (Line 15), whereas C1’s doctor has ‘been looking after [C1] for twenty years’ (Line

17). Note the symmetry between twenty minutes and twenty years, which highlights the

contrast. This classifies C1’s assessment (as being ineligible for benefits) as unreasonable.

C1 further shows the unreasonableness of his difficulty through the long waiting time to get

an appeal. The wait time is characterized with a three-part, repeating list (‘<wait. (0.3)

°°wait. wait.°>’, Line 22, see Jefferson, 1991), and an extreme case formulation (‘every

time’, Line 23, see Pomerantz, 1986) wherein the appeals tribunal consistently fails to

provide him with a date (Lines 23-24). C1 also shows how he has helped himself, in that he

has seen his doctor, put an appeal in, and is calling the appeals tribunal repeatedly. This

demonstrates that returning to the appeal’s tribunal by himself is not a relevant course of

action (it makes further self-help action irrelevant). C1 does further work to explain the

legitimacy of his problem, as he lists how his disease has been reclassified several times (in

the omitted lines and ending on Lines 49-51), which shows that he is ‘just #slowly getting

worse#’ (Lines 51).

Finally, note that C1 does not put his own reaction to the assessment on record.

Instead, the reactions are given as reported speech and actions from the doctor: on Line 12,

the doctor ‘laughed his head off’, and on Lines 17-19, the doctor said he knew “ffull well”

C1 was not fit for work. These reactions both portray the assessment as ridiculous – as

literally laughable. However, any personal attitude towards the issue remains off record.

Using a third party expert underscores the reasonableness of C1’s difficulty. C1 focuses on

70

the offer-relevant components of his difficulty, namely the difficulty as a troubles-telling

(Drew, 1998; Jefferson, 1988). Complaint-like aspects (such as putting his own emotions or

stance on-record) would make affiliation a more relevant next turn, and could also

undermine C1’s position of being reasonable. Avoiding stance markers promotes the sense

of C1’s turns being ‘reports’, rather than complaints (Drew, 1998). Being ‘a complainer’ is

also socially problematic (Edwards, 2005), but moreover C1 does not yet have evidence as

to how the MP would respond to such a position. As we will see in Section 3.3, below, after

the MP (or caseworker) starts an offer of assistance, constituents begin to go on record with

their personal stances, and make increasingly complaint-like turns.

The MP responds with continuers and begins a sympathetic remark, ‘I’m so-’ (Line

53, which would have been ‘I’m sorry’). As such, the MP positions himself as a troubles

recipient. This corroborates findings by Stivers (2008): the MP reserves any indication of his

own stance, mirroring the lack of personal stance displayed by C1. The MP immediately

self-repairs to an offer of assistance, treating the offer as more relevant than an expression of

sympathy.

In summary, both C1 and the MP treat the narrative description as a troubles-telling,

not a complaint – but one that is offer-relevant. The MP, by making an offer, does not treat

C1’s action as a request. The alternative would be for the MP to ‘grant’ the request, indicate

compliance, or do acceptance (Craven & Potter, 2010). C1’s action achieves recruitment, as

the MP offers assistance. C1’s turns do work to show legitimacy and reasonableness, at the

same time as building the relevance for an offer. While C1 does not do work specifically to

show that his case is relevant to the constituency office, he does show that further self-help

would be irrelevant and ineffectual.

Constituents in this data corpus all draw on the same set of practices as C1; they do not

use every practice in every meeting, but they use many of these practices together. In Extract

3.10, the constituent (C) is calling the constituency office about getting a council support

house. Note that C appears to have slightly laboured breathing, which may partially explain

the lengthy silences.

Extract 3.10: MP01.Phone-1KZ_01 1 CW: How can I help you. 2 (0.4) 3 C: Well, (.) I live on a boa:t, 4 CW: Yea. 5 (0.6) 6 C: And I’ve just been diagnosed with kidney failyure,=

((33 lines omitted CW clarifies what priority C has, and where she is eligible to get a house)) 78 CW: Okay, so can I take your name please, C tells a list of troubles (Lines 6, 9, 14, 17-18), the upshot of which is she wants to move out

of her boat and into a house (Lines 21-22). CW positions herself as a troubles recipient,

showing empathy (Lines 7, 15) and treats the actionable issue as forthcoming until the

appropriate moment (Lines 4, 10, 19, 23). C shows her trouble is legitimate with a list of

significant health problems. C also mentions that her health problems are receiving treatment

(‘diagnosed’, Line 6, ‘having (0.3) dialysis regular three times a wee:k’ Line 9, ‘go in

hospital’, Line 18), and are therefore officially recognized. She has waited for two years

before seeking further help (Line 35), which CW later confirms is a surprisingly long time –

this suggests her reasonableness. Saying ‘I just can’t seem to hget ianywhere with them’

also suggests that she has attempted to rectify the problem herself. There is further evidence

of her self-help on Lines 42-44, when she says she has tried to bid for houses, but was

unsuccessful. Overall, C makes efforts to build her case as legitimate and reasonable. As

with Extract 3.9, C does not specifically show how her case is relevant to the constituency

office, but does work to show that further attempts at self-help are irrelevant. At Line 78,

CW makes a pre-offer move, by beginning to take the details of the constituent and opening

72

the process of giving assistance. Taking a client’s name suggests that the institution is now

‘admitting’ the client, or committing to initial stages of assistance. This shows that the

narrative description successfully built a case for aid and achieved recruitment of an offer.

Extract 3.11 shows a further example of the presentation of troubles. In this extract,

the constituent was supposed to sponsor an immigration application, but when the United

Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) called him, there was some confusion. C thought the call

was some other agency calling about his business, rather than the UKBA, and gave the

wrong information. As a result, the application was denied. He has been unable to contact

the UKBA to correct the information.

Extract 3.11: MP01.Surgery-1KO_05 1 MP: Right. How can I help.= 2 C: =Yes. Uhm, (2.0) I:’d sent a- #uh:# a sponsorship letter, 3 MP: Right, 4 C: To:: °uhm:::° (1.4) °a cousin.

[I understand.

73

153 C: [Again. 154 MP: Have you got the name:s of: the vari[ous people, 155 C: [Yes. C highlights the unreasonableness of his situation, as well as his efforts to remedy the

situation, by reporting how the UKBA would not reveal who they were or why they were

calling. He tried to uncover what was going on while on the phone (Lines 70-73).

He portrays them as unhelpfully adhering to procedure, through reported speech where the

UKBA claimed ‘we don’t hdo that’ (Line 72) and ‘they don’t’ (Line 77). The present

continuous tense of ‘to do’ implies that it is a habitual refusal, or an institutional

requirement, and thus that the UKBA officer was sticking strictly to policy, and making no

allowances for C’s particular case. C also refrains from indicating a complaint. For instance,

on Line 70, he begins to say ‘they were just so::’, but self-repairs and restarts with a report

of what he said, rather than indicating how he felt about the UKBA’s actions. C summarizes

his trouble in Lines 147-153, minimizing the potential contingency of his need by adding ‘if

at’all possible’. He also formulates the activity as something he needs to do (‘all I needed to

do’, Line 147), rather than the MP or CW, implying there is no effort required from them.

As with Extract 3.10, The MP responds with a pre-offer (Line 154), asking for the names of

the sponsored people, showing that C has successfully achieved recruitment.

The extracts in this section show common practices: the initial stories of constituents

highlight the reasonableness and legitimacy of their difficulty, through providing evidence

of the length of time waited, the severity of their condition, the unreasonableness of other

agencies, and the ways they have tried to help themselves, all while minimizing their

personal stance on the issue. The practices used to accomplish these portrayals are

overlapping; for example, while showing one has undertaken self-help, constituents also

demonstrate the irrelevance of further self-help (which implicitly makes the help of the

constituency office relevant). Previous studies have reported practices accomplishing similar

concerns (e.g., Curl & Drew, 2008; Edwards & Stokoe, 2007; Gill et al., 2001; Stokoe &

Hepburn, 2005). Constituents’ narrative descriptions do not function as requests, but achieve

recruitment by expressions of need. Constituents allow constituency office staff to find the

upshot (Drew, 1984) of their narrative descriptions, and the MP and caseworkers treat

constituents’ narrative descriptions as offer-relevant (also see Chapter 4).

By engaging in the practice of narrative descriptions, constituents build a case for aid,

and achieve recruitment (Kendrick & Drew, 2016). This practice neatly manages several

challenges that constituents face when detailing their difficulties. Firstly, constituents must

74

manage the questions of legitimacy, reasonableness, and relevance. The narrative

descriptions give details as to why constituents’ cases are legitimate, and why constituents

are reasonable and/or in an unreasonable situation. The descriptions also show the

irrelevance of further self-help or further contact (without the help of the MP) to the agency

in question. This implicitly makes help from the constituency office relevant. Secondly,

constituents manage the difficulties of the ‘unknown’ institution (Stokoe, 2013b). It is

difficult, for example, for constituents to know how to show that their case is relevant for an

institution if they are uncertain of the institution’s remit. Building a case for assistance ‘side steps’ that difficulty, by managing the issue without directly tackling the problem (i.e.,

without asking what the remit of the office is). As mentioned above, it is also difficult to

analyze the way a request is designed to manage contingency and entitlement if it is not, in

fact, a request (Curl & Drew, 2008). Does one suggest that the contingency is so high, and

the entitlement so low, that a request is not possible? Further, if there are elements of

uncertainty about the constituency office, how can the constituents know what potential

contingencies are at play in any given request? Even if they are, in fact, aware of the

potential contingencies, they display being uncertain. Building a case for aid manages the

uncertainty issue by showing entitlement, without having to determine what the

contingencies are. Thirdly, constituents must manage the difficulty in requesting aid when

they do not know a) what aid is possible (by any institution, or even by themselves), b) what

aid is actionable (what will be effective), and c) what aid the constituency office will

actually commit to. Finally, the constituents avoid precluding courses of action that the

office could take to assist them. If the constituents make a request, they limit the next turns

for the MP or caseworker to variations of granting or refusing. By allowing the MP or

caseworker to initiate an offer, the constituent has not imposed a limit on what the office can

suggest. Overall, the narrative descriptions conveniently skirt the issue of knowing what the

constituency office is able or willing to do, meanwhile achieving recruitment of assistance

and demonstrating entitlement.

Regardless of why constituents choose to continually build the case for aid, they do

engage in this ‘case building’ throughout the encounters. Moreover, the process of building a

case in this way (via a narrative that incrementally indexes proof of legitimacy, relevance,

and reasonableness) allows for the constituency office staff to supply whatever aid they

choose. In other words, the narratives create a space in which recruitment is achieved while

navigating the possibilities of what is actionable.

75

At this point, conversation analysts may be wondering if ‘building a case for aid’

could be considered a ‘pre’ – a turn that allows for, and checks the contingencies for, a

subsequent action such as a request (see Levinson, 1983, 2013; Schegloff, 2007). I rule out

this possibility based on Fox’s (2015) analysis of pre-requests, in which she suggests that a

phrase that analysts may label as ‘pre’ may accomplish the work of a request in

conversation, and should be considered as such. Fox argues that pre-requests that check

availability or permission also accomplish a demonstration of common ground, as well as

economy of language (p.59), and that being in a service environment encourages the

interpretation of an utterance as a request (see also Lindström, 2005), making a ‘full’ or

‘overt’ request unnecessary (Fox, 2015, p.52). In other words, if a pre is treated as sufficient

for the action in question, the label of ‘pre’ hinders rather than helps our analysis. Although

the narrative descriptions discussed above are ‘preliminary’ in the sense of determining what

is actionable about the problem, they are interpreted as sufficient for offers. There is no

direct request required, and direct requests for services are consistently missing in this data

corpus. If it is challenging for constituents to determine what is actionable, as I have

suggested, it would also be inappropriate for constituents to make a request in the absence of

further information. As such, direct requests are absent, but the recruiting properties of

building a case for aid are sufficient to progress the conversation forward. It is not valid to

interpret the narrative descriptions as pre-requests because the participants do not orient to

them as preliminary.

In this section, I have also noted that constituents avoid going on record with

complaint-like statements. Constituents do not indicate their personal stance towards an

issue during the initial narratives, and sometimes self-repair away from potential

opportunities to display a complaining stance. If a stance is required, it is reported from a

third party. I suggest that this is not only to avoid the social implications of being ‘a

complainer’ (Edwards, 2005), but because constituents have not yet received evidence as to

whether the constituency office staff are aligned with the constituent’s narrative. After

receiving an offer, this changes. In Section 3.3, I will examine how constituents come to

give complaints and clear indications of their stance towards their difficulty.

3.3 The post-offer environment: Complaints and resistance

In this section, I will discuss what occurs after the MP or caseworker makes an offer of

assistance (for an analysis of the design of offers, see Chapter 4). Specifically, I will show

that constituents continue to build their case for aid, despite having received an offer, and

76

that they start to make more overtly complaint-like utterances. The constituency office staff

alter their turns as well; instead of treating constituent turns as offer-relevant, they begin to

treat the utterances more and more as affiliation-relevant. The constituency office staff end

up managing what is treated as actionable by virtue of orienting to most post-offer utterances

as affiliation-relevant, rather than offer-relevant.

I return again to the case from Extracts 3.2, 3.5, and 3.9, and the constituent who has

been assessed as ineligible for benefits.

C1 gives a minimal indication of acceptance, a nod (Line 86); however, at his first

opportunity to speak he begins to reassert the details of his difficulty, namely the timeline

(Line 89-113). C1 adds further details that show his situation to be legitimate and

unreasonable, saying he is no longer receiving benefits (Line 114). These turns disattend the

MP’s offer of assistance, which displays resistance to the offer. However, this example

shows one way in which resistance can potentially be collaborative (see Potter & Hepburn,

2003, p.218fn). In giving additional details, C1 shows he requires more help than the

original offer contained, and the MP gives a new, additional offer on Lines 230-235 to

address this. The MP characterizes the additional offer as arising from C1’s talk (‘it sounds

like’, Line 230), suggesting he is also is treating the additional details as collaboratively

contributing to the project at hand – finding what help is actionable and appropriate.

C1 has also begun to include more strongly stated stances. C1 begins a complaint on

Line 125, explaining he has tried to help himself and get the assessment centre team to

change their minds. C1 invokes an advertisement he saw from the government on Lines 131 78

138. This is a particularly useful third party expert to mention, as the government is the

expert concerning the rules about the benefits it offers. Furthermore, the government is an

organization to which the MP belongs, so the invocation of the government simultaneously

invokes the MP’s expertise and authority in the issue. That the assessment team responded

that they ‘don’t know anything ahbout that’ (Lines 142-143) shows them to be incompetent

or unreasonable – incompetent if they do not know about a policy created by their own

overseeing organization, and/or unreasonable if they are unwilling to enact said policy. C1

frames the report with ‘ithey just turned aroun’ an’ sai’’ (Lines 141-142). This portrays the

speech as surprising or arriving without warning, and as a reversal from the expected

scenario. C1 repeats this framing for the next transgression he reports, when the assessment

team inappropriately suggests C1 could get a different benefit. C1 also gives his own

reaction to this suggestion, with highly marked prosody (loud volume, very high pitched,

Lines 167-172). At this point, C1 has begun to give his own stance on the issue, portraying

himself as responding indignantly. For instance, in saying ‘’scuse me:’ (Line 168), C reports

his own speech as surprised, and as giving a highly entitled refusal. The MP demonstrates

his affiliation with this stance by collaboratively completing C1’s turn on Lines 172-173.

When C1 repeats his complaint about the assessment team (the Job Centre), the MP shows

further affiliation (Lines 255-256). The MP suggests a course of action that the Centre could

have taken, and contrasts it with a formulation that portrays the Centre as dismissive ‘just

washing their hands of it’ (Line 256). This positions him as on-side with the constituent, and

as likewise criticizing the assessment team.

It is unusual, however, for the continued detailing to result in the recruitment of

additional offers. Most of the time, the additional details are treated as affiliation-relevant,

rather than action- or offer-relevant. The continued tellings no longer achieve recruitment –

they achieve affiliation. Although I will show other examples where the continued ‘case

building’ moves into a complaint/affiliation sequence, it is important to note that the case in

Extract 3.12 does eventually arrive there too. C1’s wife (C2) arrives midway through the

meeting, and after being informed about the MP’s offers, begins her own assessment of the

situation.

stance towards the issue. C2 again makes her stance clear a few minutes later, raising a

complaint about how the benefits assessment took place and calling it ‘absolutely wha:cked’

(Line 488). The MP at first appears to make a disaligned response, saying that the work

assessment questions (to which the answers are ‘strictly speaking:’, ‘yes’, Lines 487-496) do

capture the fact that C1 is an ‘intelligent man’ (Line 491) who ‘can learn how to do new

tasks’ (Line 491). Although the MP prefaces this with ‘The trouble i:s’ (Line 487), which

shows him to be on-side with the constituents, he still portrays the questions as reasonable.

However, the MP transforms this into a more affiliative statement, acknowledging that the

questions fail to look at ‘the WIDer issues’ (Lines 499-502). In this way, the MP treats C2’s

complaint about the assessment as affiliation-relevant. An alternative way to deal with this

80

complaint would be to suggest changing the assessment procedure or the benefits policy,

which is within the MP’s power to suggest. By choosing to respond with affiliations, and not

a policy suggestion or some other offer, the MP determines what response is relevant, and

what courses of action are actionable by the constituency office. This is related to, but not

the same as, the ‘transformative answers’ in Stivers and Hayashi (2010) that retroactively

specify aspects of a question and resist inferences. Instead, here, the MP chooses among

possible subsequent relevant turns (Sidnell & Enfield, 2014), and chooses one that

retroactively characterizes the prior action as being affiliation-relevant, rather than offer relevant. It is more similar to the misalignment described in Drew (2006), as the MP treats

further narrative descriptions as confirming the relevance of the offer that has already been

made, rather than making a new offer relevant.

Ultimately, the MP reissues the offer. The discussion of C1’s difficulties continues for

several more minutes. The MP then formulates what the constituents are experiencing on

Line 736, and reissues the offer – this time as an announcement (see Chapter 4). At this

point, the constituents accept (Lines 750-751) and the meeting comes to a close.

To complement Extracts 3.12-3.13, consider what happens after the offers from

Extracts 3.10 and 3.11. Extract 3.14 continues from where Extract 3.10 left off, and concerns

the constituent who needed to move off of a boat, and on land, for health reasons.

Extract 3.14: MP01.Surgery-1KZ_01 (continuing Extract 3.10)

((40 lines omitted since Extract 3.10 of taking address, CW has asked for a reference number that C does not know, so C is searching through her bag – as she searches, line starts)) 109 C: They’ve had all:: letters, doctors letters, an’ (0.2) <all: 110 [°sorts of,>° 111 CW: [Oh:, that was gonna be my next question. 112 C: eYeah.

The clear indication of C’s stance is on Line 116, ‘An’ what annoys me is’. While Lines

109-113 also show a complainable, and are indicative of a complaint, it is less clear what

C’s stance is. Interestingly, C chooses this moment in the interaction to make her stance

clear, and to complain that the other applicants have gotten the service that she herself has

not yet received. Previously, in Extract 3.10, C had started to mention that she had bid on

houses without success (Ext. 3.10, Lines 42-44). At that moment, however, the complaint

about others having ‘bugger all hwrong with ’em’ (Line 117) does not arise. Instead, C

mentions that other people may be in the same situation as herself, in other words, not

receiving service. This portrays her issue as part of a broader trouble in need of remedy.

Lines 116-117 in this extract, however, portray her situation as unfair, and in need of

personal attention to remedy the unfairness. It is only once C is in the environment of an

offer-in-progress that she raises the socially riskier action of overtly complaining about

others.

However, CW only gives minimal responses (Lines 114, 118, 122, 126) that do not

affiliate with C’s complaint. This may be for two reasons: first, the overall activity is the

offer-in-progress and the search for a reference number required to complete the offer,

which is different than being in a fully post-offer environment (as in Extracts 3.12-3.13).

Second, this CW is often more cautious in siding with constituents in ways that could align

her against other constituents in the district. C orients to this lack of affiliation in Lines 119 125. First, she reissues the annoyance, but now phrases it at a generalized feeling that most

people feel, using the general ‘you’ (‘yah’, Line 120). Second, she returns to reporting

personal suffering, such as her stress (Line 120) and health issues (Line 124), rather than

reporting transgressions.

After the offer in Extract 3.11 (which concerned the constituent’s inability to contact

the UKBA), in Extract 3.15 the constituent also continues to build his case for assistance,

following the same pattern as Extracts 3.12-3.14.

Extract 3.15: MP01.Surgery-1KO_05 (continuing Extract 3.11)

trying to call a UKBA office. This turns out to preface a complaint, that there was no way to

contact the UKBA office. CW initially receives Line 264 as a trouble, reassuring C that she

will call that location anyway and C should not worry (Lines 266-268). However, C pursues

the complaint aspect of his difficulty. Line 269 begins with ‘But-’, suggesting he is taking a

divergent sequence. He indicates his stance towards the issue, ‘it’s (a) frustrating’ (Lines

269-270), and goes on to suggest that the lack of contact information is a problem in and of

itself. Line 272 begins ‘There’s <got to be:,>’, suggesting C is about to insist (rather than

propose) a change is required. C downgrades this with ‘at least’, before abandoning the

insistence for an account that minimizes the contingencies inherent in his suggestion. ‘All I

woulda done’ (Lines 272-273) portrays the cost of hosting an answering machine or call

back line as nominal.

The MP and CW do not specifically take up C’s proposal. To alter the ability of the

general public to contact the UKBA would be a substantial change in policy, which may be

why they do not offer any action or treat such a complaint as actionable. C pursues the issue

on Lines 280-288, saying ‘It’s something that’s wor:th, (0.2) perhaps making a point’. C

leaves it ambiguous whether it is he that is making the point known now, as a criticism, or

83

whether he is suggesting that the constituency office take up the complaint and make a point

about it in the future. This may make a new, politically-oriented offer relevant (see Chapter

6). The MP now does an affiliative turn, collaboratively completing C’s turn on Lines 283 286, ‘For you to get in touch with them’. This shows the MP fully understands C’s

perspective, and is affiliative, without committing the MP to any specific action. The MP

goes on to repeat the offer made earlier (Lines 289-290). The offer ‘>We can< explain it’

treats C’s difficulty as continuing to be related to the miscommunication between C and the

UKBA, rather than a complaint about the way the service is structured. This sequentially

deletes the relevance of an offer concerning the UKBA’s policies.

Extracts 3.12-3.15 shows how constituency office staff can use affiliation (or a lack of

it) to manage what is made relevantly actionable by the constituents’ turns. The staff’s turns

guide constituents through what issues are requestable, offer-relevant, and actionable. This

section has also shown that constituents take offers of assistance as indications of being

sympathetic to the constituent’s concerns (Pomerantz, 1986), allowing for constituents to

upgrade their concerns to complaints after the offer. As the final component in the analysis

of the ‘building a case for aid’ sequences at the constituency office, I will examine how both

constituents and constituency office staff pursue offers.

3.4 The omni-relevance of actionability: Participant pursuit of offers

In this section I will consider how both constituents and constituency office staff pursue the

relevance of offers across the encounters. At the end of initial narratives, offers are relevant,

and when they are absent, participants pursue them. Constituents continue to build a case for

aid even when an offer is presented, but this appears to be part of determining what is

actionable at the office and, as see in Section 3.3, continued or upgraded narrative

descriptions tend to get affiliation, rather than further offers. In this section, I consider the

moments when continued case building occurs in the absence of an offer. As I will show,

participants (both citizens and staff) orient to the relevance of an offer, suggesting it is

‘omni-relevant’. When the offer is absent, it is accountable. This may further explain the

way constituents continue to build a case for aid throughout the encounter, in that service

provision is the way that participants can make sense of “who-we-are-and-what-we-are doing” (Fitzgerald, Housley & Butler, 2009, p.50), and the absence of service (through

offers) requires continued pursuit of potential actionable items.

In the first extract, Extract 3.16, the constituents run a local business. Their

competitors, across the United Kingdom (UK), have started to copy them, even their

84

business name. The constituents are seeking a way to make themselves more unique, as well

as more attractive to their growing market of overseas customers. They propose to add the

words ‘UK’ to the end of their business name, but only for the purposes of promotion and

their website – not officially (such as on tax records). They have contacted the MP to see if

this is possible. The constituents (C1 and C2) have already explained their situation. The MP

begins the extract by giving advice, rather than an offer, but the constituents pursue and

eventually get an offer.

Extract 3.16: MP01.Surgery-2BZ2_02 1 MP: [I don’t think you need anything for- for websites. >This 2 is about company na:me[s, 3 CW: [Mm 4 MP: So if you aren’t changing your company na:me I think you 5 just go ahead and use it. 6 (1.1) 7 C2: [Right, 8 CW: [Mm 9 (0.3) 10 MP: >I mean [>>We could- ( )-] We could go-= 11 C1: [(cause they-) ] 12 MP: =>I mean the people you could che-< I- um >>you know you 13 could<< check with just the tra- e- tra- trading standards, 14 CW: [Yeah, 15 C2: [Ye:s, 16 MP: [Chris Mic[haels um 17 C1: [Yes, 18 (.) 19 C2: >Because [I think- [if it said that you was making, 20 MP: [Or- (.)

85

163 C1: [We can use it. 164 MP: =>If you wanted to use it in a company name, >that’d be 165 different, but if you can use it-< >>If you want to use it 166 in a website that’s absolutely fine but why don’t-< just 167 for completeness,= 168 CW: =[Yeah 169 MP: =[Do you mind giving Arthur (.) Taylor a [call:, 170 CW: [No. That’s fi:ne, In Lines 1-5, the MP gives his advice, to simply use the word ‘UK’. He suggests that the

constituents contact the relevant agency to double check that this is acceptable (‘you

could<< check with’, Line 13). C2’s response to this does not address the advice directly,

but diverges onto the topic of indicating whether products are ‘made in the UK’ (Lines 21 22). C2’s turn disattends the MP’s advice, which also serves to resist it, and even

sequentially delete it. Although C2 prefaces her turn with ‘Because’ (Line 19), which

conveys a sense of continuing from prior talk, the rest of her turn does not deal with the

advice. Instead the preface ties the turn to talk before the extract, when C2 was introducing

the problem.

The constituents go on to build their case again, making an offer relevant. They tell a

story of how they have been copied, which suggests they are dealing with an unreasonable

situation. C1 says that ‘They copy everything don’t they in the world now but .hhh It’s- it’s

maddening’ (Lines72-74). This portrays the constituents as reasonable, in that they accept

that copycats are a modern evil that cannot be avoided. It also leads directly into both an

indication of their stance towards the issue (‘it’s maddening’) and an indication of the

legitimacy of their problem, in that they are facing unfair competition. The copycats do not

pay business rates (this is due to them operating solely online, whereas the constituents have

a shop, and need a shop, Line 153), but the constituents do. The constituents thus present a

case of facing high competition, while being reasonable people, making their case more

legitimate. Note that this expression of stance comes after the advice from the MP. This

deviant case suggests that expressions of stance appear after the MP or caseworker provides

any assistance (such as advice) that also indicates alignment, not only offers.

The case building is successful, as the MP, on Lines 158-169, makes an offer to assist

them. Although the MP stands by his advice (Lines 160-166), he asks CW to phone the

relevant agencies on the constituents’ behalf. The pursuit, via continuing to build a case and

continuing to make an offer relevant, results in a transaction of assistance. Extract 3.16 also

demonstrates that offers do not necessarily follow any given instance of narrative

description. In Sacks’s (1992, p.313-314) words, “there are some activities that are known to

get done in [a] setting, that have no special slot in it, i.e., do not follow any given last

86

occurrence, but when they are appropriate, they have priority.” Offers are treated as omni relevant by being pursued, and by their ability to arise at any given point while still being

appropriate.

It is not only constituents who constantly orient to offers, however. The MP also

orients to the relevance of an offer. When an offer is not possible, the MP apologizes for it,

and even offers to still do something on the constituent’s behalf, such as checking in with

them in the future. This is seen in Extract 3.17, below. The constituent (C) is in dispute over

a local planning decision that is impacting his business. Members of Parliament, however,

cannot interfere with local planning decisions at all. This is the only case in the corpus where

there is no ‘substantial’ offer – an offer that directly attempts to deal with the issue.

Extract 3.17: MP01.Surgery-2BZ2_03 1 C: He’s got (.) the z- exact same size building, (.) °>ifunnily 2 enough it’s just< exactly the same size,° .hhh uh:m: (.) an’ 3 he hasn’t got a limit on his, 4 (0.8) 5 MP: .hh >No but they< are allowed to put in different conditions, 6 I- >I mean I guess it was a-< it was a matte- wh- when the- 7 (0.3) Um look, #I: mean# >the first thing I should say is 8 Members of Parliament< have no °influence on the planning 9 pro[cess.° 10 C: [Mm:, 11 (0.4) 12 C: M[m, 13 MP: [So:: ahm (.) you know I can: >>obviously<< (.) you know, 14 (0.3) relay: concerns to the council, whether it’s expressed 15 by you as a (0.2) a[pplicant,= 16 C: [Mm:,

C has been telling his story for several minutes. At Line 1, C is explaining that another

business owner in the area has the same size building, but without the planning restrictions

that have been placed on C’s building. This demonstrates the unreasonableness of C’s

situation, as well as providing evidence that there is precedent for his problem to be solved.

The MP begins to explain how different restrictions can be applied to different buildings

(Lines 5-6), but stops. He then gives an account for why he cannot offer assistance (which

simultaneously tells that he cannot offer assistance, Lines 7-8) – that MPs are not allowed to

interfere or ‘influence’ the process that is affecting C’s business. The account pre-empts the

possibility that C will expect an offer and shows that the MP is oriented to the relevance of

an offer. Special work is required to prevent or remove the relevance of an offer, suggesting

that an offer was potentially relevant all along until negated.

87

C acknowledges the MP’s account, but passes the opportunity to comment more

substantially (Lines 10-12). The MP then offers to ‘relay: concerns to the council’ (Line 14),

but formulates this offer as something he could ‘>>obviously<<’ do (Line 13) and not

substantial. This ‘conciliatory’ offer shows that even when the MP accounts for his inability

to offer help, he still finds it necessary to do some offering. Even with the account and the

conciliatory offer, C still continues to build a case for aid, as with the interactions previously

show in this chapter. After ten minutes of further negotiation of C building a case for aid,

and the MP denying the ability to help, the MP says:

Extract 3.18: MP01.Surgery-2BZ2_03 (continued from Extract 3.17) 1 MP: >But look< I’m afraid there’s- there’s- Yeah. (0.8) 2 Apart from understanding where you’re coming from, (‘I need 3 more) people,’ u:m don’t- >Yeah let’s just-< >l- we’ll have 4 to see< where the process ends. 5 (0.3) 6 C: °Mkay.° I appreciate even:, I kno- I o- I uh- I understan:d 7 you can’t just turn around an’ go:, on the phone: 8 [an’ it’s not as ea]sy as that. 9 MP: [Unfortunately not.]

The MP here reissues the offer, highlighting how insufficient it is. The MP formulates his

inability as unfortunate (‘I’m afraid’, Line 1; ‘Unfortunately’, Line 9) and as something that

he is required to do (‘we’ll have to’, Lines 3-4). The offer is presented as conciliatory and

insufficient. It is the MP himself who formulates the offer in this way, demonstrating his

own orientation to the relevance of an offer when a constituent presents a trouble. The

meeting ends shortly after Extract 3.18.

In this section, I have shown how both the staff and the constituents orient to an offer

when it is absent, which demonstrates how offers are treated as continually (‘omni’) relevant

in each encounter. When an offer is absent, it can be pursued. Although constituents

regularly continue to build their case for assistance even after an offer, this additional work

will be treated as affiliation-relevant, rather than offer-relevant, if the constituents have

already received an offer (see Section 3.3). When an offer is yet to be made, the additional

building of a case is treated as offer-relevant. The MP also orients to a lack of offers as

accountable; in the only encounter where no offer of assistance is given, the MP accounts for

his inability to help, and also offers a ‘conciliatory’ offer that is formulated as insubstantial.

Offers are the backbone of the constituency office encounters, and their relevance is crucial

to the sequential organization of the interactions.

88

3.5 Discussion

This chapter has shown that constituents do not use direct requests to achieve recruitment.

Their use of narrative descriptions solves several interactional challenges, including

incrementally building a case for aid, managing the ‘unknown’ nature of the institution,

concerns about contingency and entitlement, and other previously documented concerns

such as reasonableness and legitimacy (see, e.g., Drew & Heritage, 1992; Edwards &

Stokoe, 2007; Heritage & Clayman, 2010; Stokoe & Hepburn, 2005). In this chapter, I have

shown how encounters at the constituency office are structured. Interactions typically begin

with the phrase ‘How can I help?’, which starts the official business of the service encounter.

Constituents use their initial turns to bid for and project longer upcoming turns, which office

staff permit. Constituents then describe the difficulties that brought them to the constituency

office. The action of offering, by the MP and/or caseworker, is the central way of achieving

a transaction of assistance, as well as the main way that the office staff tacitly instruct

constituents as to what is offer-able.

The first difference between other institutional studies and the encounters in this

corpus is that constituents do not typically try to demonstrate the relevance of their case for

the constituency office. Instead, they focus on demonstrating the irrelevance of pursuing

further self-help. This may relate to the issue of the ‘unknown’ nature of the institution

(Stokoe, 2013b). Demonstrating the irrelevance of other actions helps to promote the

relevance of assistance from the constituency office, without specifically making any single

course of action relevant. This is useful if constituents do not know what courses of action

are possible, and helps to avoid rejection, as well as prematurely eliminating possible offers.

The ‘unknown’ nature also relates to the second difference seen at the constituency office,

which is the way that actionability is negotiated. Clients do work to demonstrate the

actionability of their concern (Schegloff, 1991; doctorability, Robinson & Heritage, 2006;

mediate-ability, Edwards & Stokoe, 2007; police-ability, Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990), as

do constituents at the constituency office. However, while constituents’ narrative

descriptions build actionability, they also allow ample interactional space for the MP and

caseworker to co-construct what is actionable.

As with extended request sequences in service environments (see Fox, 2015; Lee,

2009), the narrative descriptions involve work from both the institutional practitioner and the

client. They collaborate to build what ultimately becomes the service transaction, or as Lee

(2009, p.1255) puts it, “What the request ends up to be is thus a joint construction between

the parties.” Such collaboration is particularly useful in an environment where the

89

actionability of an issue is uncertain or unknown to the constituents. The narrative

descriptions allow for the MP and caseworker to make offers, and these offers tacitly inform

constituents as to what is actionable. The uncertainty about what is actionable also accounts

for the third difference at the constituency office: a lack of overt requests for service. As the

constituents may not be clear on what is requestable (what courses of action may be

possible, what may solve their problem, and what the MP is willing to do), it is difficult to

make a request. Building a case for aid allows for collaborative construction of the ‘request’

and as a result, requests themselves are unnecessary.

The fourth difference between the constituency office and other institutions is that the

MP gives strong indications of affiliation and empathy in response to constituent concerns.

Past studies have observed that it is unusual for institutional practitioners to affiliate with

complaints (Ekström & Lundström, 2014; Orthaber & Marquez-Reiter, 2011; Stokoe &

Edwards, 2007; Stokoe & Hepburn, 2005; Stokoe, 2013b; Zimmerman, 1992). Although

there is not space to fully address this difference in the analysis, it is worth noting that the

MP and caseworkers do a lot of work to align with the constituents. I am not suggesting that

the MP is engaging in less institutional talk by affiliating – as Traverso (2009) has pointed

out, affiliation can be difficult to achieve even in mundane conversations. The MP may be

motivated by the ‘personal vote’ (see Chapters 1, 5, 6). Appearing as on-side with

constituents may promote good relations with the constituents, who may then be more likely

to vote for him in the future. As I have also shown in this chapter, the alignment can work to

retroactively characterize constituent turns as complaints rather than requests, and reduce the

relevance of offers.

After receiving an offer, constituents continue to build a case for aid. The descriptions

are often upgraded, and constituents begin to put their personal stance about an issue on

record – suggesting they take the offer to be an indication that the MP or caseworker is on

side and affiliating with them. This supports findings in mundane interaction (Traverso,

2009, p.2393) that participants do work to enhance the complainability of their concern after

receiving affiliation. However, especially in other institutional environments, continuing to

make an offer relevant when an offer has already been given would be interpreted to

challenge the appropriateness of the offer, or as pursuit of some further or different offer

(Gill, 2005; Stivers, 2002, 2005; Stivers & Rossano, 2010). At the constituency office, this is

not the case. The MP and caseworkers do not directly refute the relevance of potential

further offers (e.g., by stating they are unable, or they can only do certain things, etc., but see

Chapter 5 on policy-related implications). Instead, the staff treat further details as making

90

affiliation relevant, as if the descriptions were complaints-implicative, rather than request implicative. We should not treat these activities as pursuit if they are not so treated by the

participants (unlike pursuit that did achieve a subsequent offer, as in Extract 3.16).

It is possible that constituents continue building their case because they do not know

whether to be satisfied with the offer they have received, or if further offers are forthcoming.

They may also be resisting the relevance of closing the encounter; to accept the offer would

be to complete the service transaction, and the interaction would soon end. Constituents may

also be resisting the implication that their difficulty is easy to solve. After all, constituents

face a dilemma when presenting their difficulty, in that they must present it as so-far unsolveable by other organizations, but potentially solveable by the constituency office. A

similar contradiction is seen in Ekström, Lindström and Karlsson (2013), wherein debtors

must present themselves as currently unable to pay, but able to pay in the future.

Constituents may resist ending the encounter after the first offer in order to pre-empt the

implication that their problem is easily solveable, which is inconsistent with their narrative.

Overall, the context of ‘service encounter’ is extremely important for the constituency

office. Participants orient to the continual relevance of offers and the service transaction,

which promotes the interpretation of narrative descriptions as making offers relevant, rather

than as pre-requests (Fox, 2015). There is also no need to see these turns as requests or

‘pseudo’ requests. Constituents’ build a case for assistance, and that achieves recruitment

(Kendrick & Drew, 2016). By focusing on turns that work towards recruitment, constituents

can neatly manage the challenges they face surrounding the ‘unknown’ institution, while

simultaneously fulfilling the issues inherent in making requests (such as showing legitimacy,

etc.).

The MP and caseworkers must manage the omni-relevance of offers as well. In this

chapter, I have described how they use affiliation in the post-offer environment, and how

that functions to reduce the relevance of further offers. But the offers themselves are also

designed in a way that manages what actions are relevant. In the next chapter, I will analyze

the way the constituency office staff design offers, and how those designs manage and

control the relevant next options.

91

Chapter 4:

Offers and the nuances of action: Offering turns and their design at the

constituency office

4.0 Introduction

As I have shown in the last chapter, offers are the central practice for getting constituency

office work done. The Member of Parliament (MP) and caseworkers responded to the

constituents’ descriptions of difficulties with offers of assistance. Offering assistance is the

primary business of constituency office encounters (rather than politics or holding the MP to

account, see Chapter 5). I also showed that the constituency office staff used affiliation to

manage the relevance of offers, which helped to control the direction of the encounter and to

tacitly instruct constituents as to what assistance was actionable. The other way to manage

what assistance is being made relevant is through the design of turns that accomplish

offering. In this chapter, I will analyze how staff design the turns that accomplish offers, and

how the design changes based on where the offer occurs in the encounter. In Section 4.1, I

will evaluate the current conversation analytic research on offers and their design (see

Hofstetter & Stokoe, 2015), pointing out that previous research has been too limited in terms

of the range of formats examined and analyzed as accomplishing an offer. In Section 4.2, I

will begin the analysis of the offers, starting with ‘proposal-offers’. Proposal-offers are the

first offers made to constituents concerning a problem, and seek permission and acceptance

in order to act. Subsequently, as analyzed in Section 4.3, staff used ‘announcement-offers’,

which confirm the plan to carry out an offer after the encounter. Finally, in Section 4.4, I

analyze ‘request-offers’, which include an aspect of ‘requesting’ in the turn design. These

offers make it relevant for the constituent to accept the offer, and tend to occur near the end

of the encounter. I will discuss the findings in Section 4.5, noting the need to have more

flexible action ‘categories’ in conversation analysis in general. I will also discuss the question

of whether the offers in this corpus should be considered initiating or responsive actions, and

whether that distinction aids analysis. Overall, this chapter will be of particular interest to

conversation analysts interested in the achievement of action, and supports recent literature

that has called for more nuanced approaches to action ‘ascription’ (Kendrick & Drew, 2014;

Levinson, 2013; Sidnell & Enfield, 2014).

92

4.1 The action of offering

Offers are, intuitively at least, the bedrock activity of service provision and other institutional

settings, such as call centres or doctors’ offices, as well as a regular activity in everyday

social life. They can include concrete transactions, such as asking, ‘Milk? Sugar?’ when

offering tea (Kärkkäinen & Keisanen, 2012), as well as more intangible commitments to

future action such as asking, ‘Do you want help with your homework?’ (Curl, 2006;

Davidson, 1984). They may be made to fulfil another’s need or desire, but they also may

occur in the absence of any expressed need (Curl, 2006). But while they are a ubiquitous

conversational action, offers can be difficult to define empirically. Conversation analysis,

being an inductive process, has an ambiguous relationship with definitions. The Oxford

English Dictionary (‘Offer’, n.d.) provides the following definition of an offer: “An

expression of readiness to do or give something if desired.” The verb, ‘to offer’, is defined as

“providing” or “presenting” something, “expressing readiness” to do something, and “to

present or proffer something for someone to accept or reject as desired”.

Unsurprisingly, however, the OED definition is not entirely aligned with what

participants in conversation actually treat as an offer. Offers take a variety of formats in a

variety of contexts, making them difficult to disaggregate from ‘invitations’, ‘proposals’, or

‘suggestions’. Even ‘requests’, which Kendrick and Drew (2014) point out have been

regarded as the ‘opposite’ of offers, can potentially be interpreted as doing precisely such an

action (see Extracts 4.15 and 4.16 below). In her own work on offers, Curl (2006: 1258) does

not define what an offer is, but provides a statement to specify the general action under

investigation as one which satisfies “some want or need of the recipient’s, or propos[es] to

assist in the resolution of a difficulty or misfortune experienced by the recipient”. Somewhat

earlier, Maynard (1986: 268) argued that “parallel and consistent displays of alignment”

constitute offers, in that they are done for the benefit of another person and made complete by

recipient acceptance or rejection. Others have challenged the notion that offers are contingent

on the recipient’s acceptance or rejection, however; Toerien, Shaw, Duncan and Reuber

(2011) show how doctors use offers to circumvent patients’ ability to reject or resist treatment

options, which is similar to what we will see in the analysis of the constituency office data

(see Section 4.4). This suggests that offers remain more contingent on the beneficial nature of

the transaction, rather than the recipient’s response.

In a recent paper, Couper-Kuhlen (2014) examined initiating actions that bring about,

or aim to bring about, potential future courses of action, including offers. As a typology, such

initiating actions prefer an accepting or aligning response; index regularly and negotiate

93

issues of deontic and epistemic stance, and are geared towards making a future state exist

(Couper-Kuhlen, 2014: 624). Offers are specifically defined as having the ‘Self’ as an agent

(i.e., the offerer does the action required to bring about the future state), and the ‘Other’ as

beneficiary (i.e., the recipient gets the object or assistance committed by the offerer), whereas

requests work in the opposite direction (Couper-Kuhlen, 2014, p.628). However, the question

of who benefits from an offer, and who suffers the costs, depends significantly on what the

participants consider to be a benefit or a cost. Costs and benefits are not necessarily split such

that one party benefits entirely and one party entirely is at cost. From a psychological

perspective, when speakers make offers they place recipients in their debt (or at least earn

their gratitude), which is a benefit to the speaker that could entirely outweigh any potential

‘cost’. Further, an anthropologist might note that offering (and gift-giving, see Mauss, 1990

[1950]) is fundamental to cementing relationships and even inter-group treaties, and thus any

‘cost’ of offering is obscured by the potential benefits.

This difficulty in attributing costs and benefits can be seen in the extract below from

the Holt collection. Lesley is having a package delivered to Philip, but the delivery company

failed to charge Lesley for carriage costs. As it is a gift, she requests that he tell the company

to charge her.

Extract 4.1: Holt: X(Christmas)1:1:3 (from Curl, 2006) 1 Les: =The hother thin:g (.) was (.) uhm .t.h we’ve had ’n 2 invoice: fr'm Scott’s .hh (.) Now if they deliver it 3 (0.5) to iyou: UH (0.7) we- (.) we wanted t’pay the 4 Les: hcarriage w’l they havhen’t invoiced us f’r any 5 carriage. 6 Phi: .hwhh (.) We:l[l 7 Les: [So- 8 (0.2) 9 Phi: [they 10 Les: [if they come t’you an’ invoice you f’carriage say 11 th[at it’s we that’re paying oka:y? ((smile voice)) 12 Phi: [eYeah

While Lesley’s ‘request’ benefits Philip – he will not have to pay for delivery of the package,

it also benefits Lesley – she can maintain her status as gift-giver and fulfil her goal (‘we

wanted t’pay the hcarriage’). The same dilemma is found in the politician-constituent data. In

Extract 4.2, the MP’s caseworker (CW) is speaking to a constituent (C), and requests to use

information that the constituent explained earlier in the call.

94

Extract 4.2: MP01.Phone-1KK_03 1 CW: .hh right Okay well I’ll look forward to your email then 2 and then can I use that information .hh and send it on to 3 the clinical commissioning group is that all ri:ght,= 4 C: =°Okay° that no problem at’all. 5 CW: Super. All [righ]t then,= 6 C: [’Kay] 7 CW: =Thanks ever so mu:ch.= CW’s request (Lines 2-3) benefits CW, in that she can now fulfil her offer of assistance, but

ultimately benefits C, who will receive the assistance he requires. In addition, the MP (and

CW, by virtue of being the MP’s employee) benefits from helping the constituent, through

possibly building ‘rapport’ and the ‘personal vote’ (see Section 1.2.1, Chapter 6). Who is the

beneficiary in these instances? Are these requests or offers or something else? Couper Kuhlen (2014) uses the term ‘Proposals’ to refer to these shared cost-benefit situations, but

whether or not ‘proposal’ correctly characterizes the activities of Extracts 4.1 and 4.2 is moot.

Furthermore, in neither extract are there clearly definable costs, only possible shared benefits.

The cost/benefit possibilities are too variable for these categories.

Clayman and Heritage’s (2014) concept of a ‘benefactive’ stance (and status) helps

analysts navigate the question of what is beneficial. They introduce this idea with the same

conundrum: “it may not always be the case that the offer recipient will treat the thing offered

as a benefit” (p.4). In the same way that ‘epistemic stance’ describes how a turn configures

distributions of knowledge, ‘benefactive stance’ refers to how talk distributes costs and

benefits, as interlocutors see them. Benefactive status is “a complex of underlying conditions

for the action, including such matters as whether a service will be rendered that is of actual

benefit to its recipient, whether the performer of the service is able and willing to perform

it…” (p.5). However, the concept relies on the possibility of objectively identifying “actual”

costs and benefits, whereas in many cases, including the ones above, it is not explicit, and the

benefits are overlapping. That said, benefactive stance provides a way of looking at the range

of offers, requests, invitations, and other future projecting initiating actions. These actions

have long been considered as part of a similar group (cf. Couper-Kuhlen, 2014), but also as

discrete ‘objects’ (see Davidson, 1984). But it may be more helpful to conceptualize these

actions as a spectrum of options for initiating actions and transactions. Sacks (1992, p.331)

wrote:

95

We think of an ‘offer’ as something different than a ‘request’ or a

‘warning’ or a ‘threat’. But in some situations the offer is simply the first

version of getting the person to do something. … One wants then to

reconsider these objects – offer, request, warning, threat – not as though

they’re a series of different things, but to see them as sequential versions

of a something…

As Couper-Kuhlen (2014) suggests, requests, offers, invitations, proposals, suggestions,

warnings, etc., all share the goal of negotiating the creation of a future action, with two axes

of variation (the degree of interlocutor agency, and the eventual distribution of benefits

between them). While Couper-Kuhlen and Clayman and Heritage suggest an interpretation

based on ‘actual’ costs and benefits, Sacks’s suggestion leads to a more flexible

interpretation, based on what the participants wish to achieve by doing the action (e.g., appear

agentive, intimidate, cajole, hint, welcome). These additional goals will continue to confound

our interpretation of action ascription unless we allow for actions such as requests and offers

to be conceptualized as zones on a spectrum of possible actions, with grey areas between

possibilities. This is because, as Stokoe (2012) points out, it is not the job of analysts to be

more specific about designedly ambiguous descriptions and actions, than members

themselves are. The fact that we cannot be definitive about what an action ‘is’ is what gives

language practices their defeasibility (see Edwards, 2005; Sidnell, 2012).

Based on the offers in my dataset, I have defined offers as actions that indicate a future

action for the benefit of the recipient, even if other benefits arise, and which are at least

mostly enacted by the speaker. Most offers in this data fall into Curl’s (2006) category of

“offers that are responsive to overt problems” (p.1270-1275). Unsurprisingly, we found no

examples of offers as a reason-for-calling; in almost all calls, constituents are calling to

receive, not make, offers of assistance. There are also no examples of what Curl calls

‘educed-problem’ offers, in which an offer is made distally to the original discussion of the

problem (typically in a closing section), and the offer is made based on some item the speaker

has educed to be a problem. This is also unsurprising, as constituents contact constituency

offices because they have a problem, and their problem is therefore discussed explicitly. As

previous studies have found, institutional interactions often encourage the interpretation of

utterances as service-relevant (Fox, 2015; Lindström, 2005), which differs from context in

the mundane interactions that were studied by Curl. All of the MP or caseworker offers are

made in response to overt problems, but do not all match the offer format or style as

96

described in Curl, even allowing for the variety of formats she identified. For example, her

participants never used a ‘do you want’ format in these types of offers. This suggests that the

institutional context of the constituency office has a significant impact on how offers are

designed and what the designs may be used to do, but it also suggests that our overall

understanding of offer formats cannot be limited to these designs. I will argue that offers

should be considered along a spectrum of actions that include proposals, announcements,

invitations, and suggestions. The grey areas between prototypical examples should be seen as

zones in which some additional work is being done by the turn in question, rather than as an

invalidation of the offering aspects of the turn.

The analysis below is divided into three sections. The first, Section 4.2, focuses on

‘proposal offers’ (“Can I do X?”; “do you want me to do X?”), which I found to be the

format for first offers of a certain course of action following a problem presentation from a

constituent. I will also differentiate between offering a potential course of action, and

explaining a potential course of action. The second section, 4.3, focuses on ‘announcement

offers’ (“I will do X”), and the final section, 4.4, on ‘request offers’ (“Let me do X”). In each

section, I will consider the interactional and institutional affordances of these different offer

designs.

4.2 First offers: Proposals

Many offers made at the constituency office are made in a similar form to a proposal. These

offers are characterized by a low degree of ‘deontic force’, in that they are formulated to

require the permission or acceptance of the constituent before being enacted. They regularly

use phrases such as “can I do X” or “do you want me to X”. In using the word ‘proposal’, I

am attempting to capture aspects of the utterances, such as their deontic and epistemic stance

and am not using it in the specific way that Couper-Kuhlen (2014) has used it to refer to a

potential future action from which both parties benefit and for which both parties contribute

to actuation. My usage is closer to that of Stevanovic and Peräkylä (2012), to refer to a

commitment to a potential future joint action that was contingent on the approval of the

interlocutor. In this analysis, the term ‘proposal’ indicates an utterance that offers a potential

future action of assistance, seeks the approval of the constituent before commencing action

on the offer.

Proposal-offers are exclusively used as the first offer of a certain course of action to a

constituent. ‘First’ does not necessarily refer to the temporally ‘first offer in an interaction’

but to the first offer of any assisting action that occurs following a first presentation of a

97

problem. For instance, in the following extract, the MP gives a first offer, following the

constituent’s (C) narrative description of his concern. This constituent is visiting because his

benefits have been cancelled and he needs help getting them reinstated.

Extract 4.3: MP01.Surgery-1KO_01 1 MP: Well then, I’m su- (0.3) Well- an’ I think- (0.3) uhm, if 2 we: were to take, >your what, your reference numbers and 3 everything [else,< 4 CW: [Yeah. They need national insurance number ((10 lines omitted, joking about constantly needing a national insurance number)) 15 MP: =So >>we take your national insurance [number<< then] 16 C: [Y e s ] 17 MP: =what we- JAson can <do is give the> uhm:: >>Tribunal 18 people a<< Ca:ll:: on Monday, ((220 lines omitted, wife enters surgery meeting)) 239 MP: Uh:m (.) No, >>We were just saying that<< we’ll- we’ll uhm 240 >contact the tribunal service The MP begins by checking with the caseworker (CW) what the procedure would be for this

case, phrasing his turn as a hypothetical ‘if we: were…’ (Lines 1-2). CW confirms that a

national insurance number is indeed necessary in order to take on the constituent’s case,

which raises a joke from the constituent about how often he has to give that number to

officials. The MP restarts the offer on Line 15, first by referencing the procedure of taking

the number (Line 15), and then describing what Jason (CW) ‘can <do’ (Line 17). This turn

design both proposes a course of action to C and describes what the office is willing to

undertake for him. Subsequently, many minutes later in the meeting, the MP confirms this

course of action, with the announcement ‘we’ll uhm >contact the tribunal service’ (Lines

239-240). This later offer is a restatement of the action from Lines 15-18, and thus receives a

different turn design (for more on announcement offers, see Section 4.3).

The proposal-first turn design shows up even when the MP or caseworker has mistaken

the offer’s temporal position. For example, in the following call, the caseworker has called

the constituent’s house to give an update on a roof leak that the housing association is

supposed to fix, but has not. Thus the call does not start with a first presentation of a problem,

because the caseworker and constituent have previous discussed the roof problem. The first

offer in the phone call is an ‘announcement offer’ regarding the update (‘I’ll go back to (.)

John [to] … explain to him that the scaffolding’s been up three weeks’ – see Section 4.3,

below). Immediately following the temporally first offer, however, the constituent (C)

introduces a new problem and a new sequence about which he has not spoken before. As part

98

of this new sequence dealing with the new problem, the caseworker (CW) gives a ‘proposal’

offer, which is first with respect to the problem in question.

Extract 4.4: MP01.Phone-1KK_08 1 C: Now there w- whil- whilst you’re on there, There wa- there 2 was something that my wife has- has actually mentioned the 3 other day, (0.6) She spoke to you before about (0.8) 4 getting Roger another place perhaps, 5 CW: .hhh Uh- well yes. But the- u:m, I mean:, (.) D- oo- I can 6 approach the: council about that most definitely if 7 you’d like me to, .hh[h the- the-] 8 C: [Well be]fore you have 9 actua(h)lly(h)eeh, 10 (0.4) 11 CW: I- I may have done in the passt,=f[orgi]ve me,

I found that the first offers for a course of action were routinely formatted as proposals,

throughout the data. On Lines 5-6 CW makes a new first ‘proposal offer’ to “approach the

council” using the “I can” format. Note that is CW’s belief that the offer has not already been

made – which is corrected by C at Lines 8-9 – that accounts for this possibly second offer

being produced as a first.

Let us look at other instances of proposal-style offers. In Extract 4.5, C has been

describing a threatening letter from her ex-partner in the context of child custody issues. At

Line 14, the caseworker (CW) makes an offer based on a complaint that happened earlier in

the call – that the Child Support Agency has not been in contact.

Extract 4.5: MP01.Phone-1KK_05 1 CW: So it was hand written, 2 C: Oh yes. This one was typed, 3 CW: hYeah. 4 C: From him. 5 (0.6) 6 CW: Right. 7 C: But um (0.8) Now it’s (0.4) e(h)hhih! 8 (1.7) 9 CW: Oh: dear, 10 (0.3) 11 C: °Anyway,° 12 (0.6) 13 CW: .hhH so Cee Ess Ay though, haven’t contacted ya since last 14 Thursday, Can I chase them for you? S’that all right?= 15 C: =<I’d love you to cos with my phone not bei:ng> (0.4) you know, 16 reLIable, 17 CW: Yeah, 18 (0.4) 19 C: U:m (0.5) <That would be fabulous.>

99

CW’s offer is formatted using what we observed to be the routine ‘can I’ format for first

offers, with a tag question (‘S’that all right?). These design choices index a low deontic

stance; that is, CW displays that she is not yet certain that this will be an acceptable course of

action for C, and gives them the opportunity to raise concerns with this particular offer of

assistance. However, C gives the preferred response, an acceptance, at Lines 15-19.

Note, however, that the offer takes place several minutes after the original problem was

formulated. Curl (2006) referred to such offers as ‘educed’, appearing “… at some point

which is temporally and sequentially distanced from the problem” (p.1265). I stated

previously that there are no educed problems in my data; this is because the second half of

Curl’s definition: “Before the offer is made, the problem it educes is not treated by either

participant as something in need of remedy” (p.1265). In Extract 4.4, the CSA issue was

treated as a problem, but CW’s offer was displaced by an inserted sequence about the

threatening letter, which then took up the majority of the call. Once dealt with, CW returned

to the original topic of the call, and made the offer accordingly. As a first offer, it was

formatted as a proposal, in which CW seeks confirmation of the appropriateness of her

proposed course of action (‘Can I chase them for you? S’that all right?=’).

Extract 4.6 provides another example of proposal-offers. In this extract, the MP and a

caseworker are talking to two constituents about the repatriation of an ill family member to a

nursing home in the United Kingdom (UK). Some contact has already occurred between the

office staff (CW and MP) and the constituents (C and C2), especially over email. At this

moment, C is inquiring about where her family member could stay while being assessed for

long-term care.

Extract 4.6: MP01.Surgery-1KO_06 1 C: So you know #you- >you say about those couple a days an’< 2 if we could sort something out to go into a private 3 residential home, .hh How would we go about that, Because 4 is that different to what we’ve found out from ringing, 5 (1.6) Ho:mes y- 6 CW: I ca[n- 7 C: [you k[now:, 8 CW: [I can get a list from,= 9 MP: =>°dYeah°<= 10 CW: =from u:m, Countyshire county council an’ people who 11 would do it, 12 (0.3) 13 C: Ri:ght,= 14 CW: =If you’d like me [to, 15 MP: [Ih- It may be, >I [s’pose that<= 16 CW: [Yea, 17 MP: =the BAsis on which they’re admitting her °is different,°

100

18 so it MAy not be in the SAme PLAce. 19 C2: Sure. 20 MP: But I suspect they’ll probably, (.) charge hmore, CW issues the offer on Lines 5-10, the first to propose finding a list of short-term nursing

home placements. The offer is phrased as a proposed, not definite, course of action, indicated

by the verb ‘can’ (instead of ‘I will’). This is further indicated by the increment added on

Line 14, ‘If you’d like me to’, which emphasizes that this course of action would only be

pursued ‘if’ the constituent approved. Such ‘I can do X’ utterances could be treated as

grammatical statements of information, informing recipients that speakers are able to do that

action. In the context of a service setting, though, where offers of assistance are a core

activity, ‘I can…’ utterances convey courses of action that are possible. In particular, at

constituency offices, where constituents need careful direction as to what aid is available, this

design helps indicate what the constituency office staff are able and willing to do. The design

presents the course of action as a potential future, to be assessed for viability and

acceptability on the part of the constituent.

There is more evidence in Extract 4.6 that shows that and how ‘I can do X’ utterances

are offers (as opposed to ‘merely’ proposals, or commitments, etc.), making assessments or

acceptances/rejections relevant. After making the offer in Lines 8-11 (‘I can get a list

from…’), C’s response is slightly delayed (Line 12) and neither accepts nor rejects the offer,

but treats it as information (‘Ri:ght, Line 13). At this point, then, C is not yet unambiguously

oriented to CW’s turn as an offer (although it is possibly on the way to being an offer). As a

result, CW adds the increment ‘If you’d like me to,’ (Line 14). This increment emphasizes

that this action is an offer, and is for the benefit of the constituents, and that it will only be

enacted if they desire. As Stevanovic and Peräkylä (2012) point out, this indexes greater

rights on the part of the constituent to have a say in how their case is managed and what

courses of action are pursued.

By indicating that the offer is contingent on the constituent’s approval, the staff a)

make clear what courses of action the constituency office staff can pursue on behalf of the

constituent, and b) treat constituents as having greater epistemic and deontic rights over their

own cases: they know all the details whereas staff only know what has been divulged so far.

If constituents have already tried certain solutions, it is not useful to try them again. In

Extract 4.6, the constituent (C) has been trying to get into state supported housing, and one

way this process works in the United Kingdom is by bidding on houses, but she was unable

to bid within the correct time period. Prior to the extract, C asked if there was new

101

information on the house – information that the caseworker (CW) was supposed to track

down. However, CW had not found any new information, and so has to report her

problematic failure to do so. Given that CW needs to help maintain good relationships with

constituents, any perceived failure is a problem to be remedied, and as in the case below, CW

usually follows any lack of success in accomplishing aid with a new offer of assistance.

Extract 4.7: MP01.Phone-2AH_03 1 CW: No::. Did you Bid on anything else, 2 C: No there wasn’t a legit flat an’ stuff, There wasn’t anything 3 else I could BId on, 4 (0.8) 5 CW: Ri::ght. .hH d’ya’wa- °n°- do you want me to ask if anybody did 6 ge:t sixty fi:ve, 7 (1.4) 8 C: Um::¿ (0.5) Wull:, you see I don’t see the point.=Because like I 9 (sent/said) to Laura Bo:nd, 10 CW: Yeah, 11 (0.4) 12 C: An’ she says well you’re just <swappin’,> (0.3) basically if >I 13 move (out a’) the village,< j’st my house is a little ways out, 14 CW: .hH Oh is it the [same] side Bathroom, 15 C: [( )] 16 (0.3) 17 C: You’re still gonna have the <steep stair> situation.= 18 CW: =Oh::, I see:. Ri:ght. Okay. Fair enough. At Lines 5-6, CW offers to find out what happened to the house (number ‘sixty fi:ve’) that C

wanted to bid on. The offer is based on whether the constituent ‘wants’ the caseworker to

look into the house, and it is also formulated as a question, requiring the constituent to

answer, and thereby accept or reject the offer. C has, therefore, a maximum amount of control

over what course of action CW will pursue. The ‘do you want’ formulation indexes an even

stronger deontic position for the constituents than the ‘can’ formulation, although both make

acceptance (or rejection) relevant. It would be inappropriate here to use an ‘announcement’

offer (see below), because the desires of C are as yet undetermined. Given that bidding was

over, an inquiry into who got the house will not help C get the house, or get some other house

in the future. Examples in my data, such as Extract 4.7, are different from those discussed in

Curl (2006), whereby ‘do you want…’ formats were used exclusively with educed problems

(“offers responsive to overt problems are never produced in this way”, p.1274). Not only is

C’s problem in Extract 4.7 not educed – as C’s housing problem was already known by both

parties, as was the issue of C’s interest in that specific house – the offer is produced

immediately after the original mention of the problem. The different sequential contexts of

the offers (in a series, see Schegloff, 2007, and Section 4.4 below) result in a different offer

102

format. Curl concludes that the reason why the ‘do you want’ format is avoided with overt

problems may be to avoid implicitly accusing the problem-holder as hinting or ‘fishing’ for

aid. She gives an example of ‘do you want’-avoidance after an overt problem, out of the

Newport Beach data, seen below.

Extract 4.8: NBII.4.R: 181-195 (from Curl, 2006) 1 Emm: [I : ’d ] LIKE TIH GET S ’ M 2 LID’L[E slipper]s but uh: 3 Nan: [Y e : ah.] 4 (0.7) 5 Emm: .t.hhh I jis do:n’t think I better walk it’s jis bleeding 6 a tiny bid’n a:nd u-I think I'm gon'stay o:ff of it it 7 thro:bs: a liddle bit.

Curl argues that Nancy’s repair from ‘dih you wanna me tuh’ to ‘c’n I getchu somethin:g’

(Lines 12-15), displays a return to the norm; the norm being to use ‘do you want’ only with

educed problems. However, this could be explained more simply: Nancy makes the repair

because she already knows that Emma does want something (Emma has just said ‘I’d like to

get some little slippers’) but is unable to acquire it. Asking “do you want” would amount to

asking Emma what Nancy has just been told in Lines 1-2. Nancy should know that Emma

cannot make use of a mere ride – Emma needs someone to physically get the slippers,

because she cannot walk (‘I just don’t think I better walk it’s just bleeding’). Whether the

‘dih you wanna’ (Line 12) was prefacing an offer of a ride or slippers, or any other type of

assistance is uncertain, given that Nancy repairs away from that format (the subsequent ‘me

tuh’ cannot grammatically follow ‘wanna’, implying that self-repair is underway). But any

offer here that does not address what Nancy ought to know will be insufficient. In contrast, in

Extract 4.7, CW does not know what C wants, vis-à-vis the house bidding. This suggests that

educed problem offers may be more about being uncertain of what is offered than about a

linguistic norm. For both parties, for CW and for Nancy, there is a social obligation to help

the party in need (C and Emma). Nancy is Emma’s sister, and thus may be expected to help

her when she is ill, and CW works for an institution where it is in their best interests to help

clients in every way possible. Neither is required (by law, ethics, or otherwise) to offer help,

103

and neither turn format could be interpreted as aught but an offer, even outside of the

institutional context in Extract 4.7. This comparison has been drawn to show that knowledge

may play a greater role in determining these turn designs, something that is clearer to see in

the institutional context, where the knowledge of CW is more available to the analyst.

With first time offers, the constituency office as an institution has a more pressing need

than a friend or family member might – to be certain that they are acting on the constituents’

wishes. Not only do they have a vested interest in acting on the constituents’ behalf, in order

to best build the ‘personal vote’ (see Section 1.2.1, Chapters 5 and 6), it is necessary for the

staff to get permission from the constituents to act on their behalf when dealing with other

organizations. First time offers are the first place this permission is sought. This institutional

formality hangs in the balance when first time offers are accepted or rejected. As a result, I

see this downgraded deontic stance in proposal-offers as the staff attempt to ensure they are

acting on the constituents’ wishes.

Note that in both Extracts 4.7 and 4.8 above, speakers ask ‘do you want me to X’, not

just ‘do you want X’. This is a crucial difference. ‘Do you want me to X’ gives greater

deontic powers to the recipient; the offer is contingent on their acceptance or desire.

Additionally, ‘do you want me to X’ includes a very clear indicator of who must carry out the

action on behalf of the recipient. This puts the recipient in a difficult position in terms of a

preferred next turn. While offers prefer acceptances (Davidson, 1984), it has been suggested

that one should also not burden others with having to do an action (Couper-Kuhlen, 2014;

Clayman & Heritage, 2014; Kendrick & Drew, 2014), which creates a cross-cutting

preference between accepting the offer and not burdening the offerer. In other words, by

indicating who must perform the action within the offer turn, the speakers are actually

creating a situation in which the preferred next turn may not be acceptance, but rejection.

This could be another reason why Nancy repaired away from ‘do you want me to’, as she

may have realized that suggested too high a burden for Emma to accept the offer. These

extracts demonstrate one way that constituency offices are more similar to mundane talk than

other institutions like doctors’ offices; constituency offices are offering services to help

constituents, not because it is their job, but because they are doing being ‘good’ community

members and representatives, just as friends and family enact being ‘good’ friends and family

when they undertake offers and actions on behalf of others. One could argue that

constituency offices are doing this in order to enact the ‘good’ representative, whereas family

members do it for other reasons (such as, they actually like the person they are helping and

want to help them). But this would go beyond conversation analysis’ capabilities. One cannot

104

say whether the constituency office staff like or do not like constituents, nor whether MPs

want or do not want to help citizens. By offering constituency services, and with each offer of

service, MPs and constituency office staff enact and re-establish their position as ‘good’

representatives, partly because of the fact that they offer these services outside of their

mandated job roles.

We have seen that at, in the constituency office, first offers of assistance are done using

a particular proposal-style design, and made with downgraded deontic stance, indexing that

the offer may not be appropriate or acceptable to the constituent. The constituent is expected

to respond to these proposal-offers, and response is usually pursued when absent. Proposal offers can be made with more than one format, including ‘Do you want (me to) X’, ‘Can I X’,

and ‘I can X’ (see Extract 4.6). The latter format can be confused with explanations of what

the constituency office is able to accomplish. I will now differentiate between offers and

explanations of what is offer-able.

4.2.1 ‘Can’ as an offer vs. ‘Can’ as an explanation

Proposal-offers can appear, grammatically, like explanations of what the office is capable of

doing, rather than what it is offering. Both explanations and proposal-offers regularly use the

modal verb ‘can’ (and its conditional form, ‘could’), and both reference potential future states

or courses of action. In real time interaction, however, staff are rarely asked to explain what

the office is able to do. Extract 4.9 below, however, demonstrates the use of ‘can’, both as an

offer, and subsequently as an explanation of the options for courses of action. In the first part

of the extract, the constituent has been explaining that he is a small business owner in a

residential area, and one resident has been complaining about parking at the business to the

local council. The MP for the area is Michael Johnson. A series of offers is made by the

caseworker (CW) in Lines 14-17.

Extract 4.9: MP01.Phone-2AH_01 1 C: <Which they have now put all enforcement #ionto us#> han:d 2 I’ll be honest with you, (0.7) <I feel> very weak at this 3 stage because I feel like they-=they’ve overpowered me an’ 4 there’s nothing I can do about it. 5 CW: Ri:ght, Okay. 6 C: I mean >#to be ho- I-# I don’t know if it’s the best route 7 to take.< People keep saying try:, you know, (.)

105

13 (0.2) 14 CW: .hhhhhHH hWELL we ca- We can certainly look into it for 15 you.=That’s not a problem an:’ if we need to: u:m: uh: get 16 in touch with the council, we’ll Happily do #so,#=tha- 17 that’s not a pro#blem:#, Yeah. Absolutely .hhh[hH 18 C: [Will y- e- e- 19 (0.2) 20 C: #I- I-# e- >you know I don’t know what’s best to do< 21 #>would’you-e-<# Do you- Do you: do like appointments 22 w[here you ca-] 23 CW: [Yeah::, ]I- I think um proba’ly the best <thing to 24 do: i:s if <<you are able to come in>>to the office, #I 25 mean: uhm# presum’bly you canh you get here if you’re based 26 in Bramley, .hhhH uh We can go through it.

The conclusion of C’s problem formulation is that ‘people keep saying’ (Line 7) he should

try contacting the constituency office for help, because he knows that the MP is someone

who ‘really suppor:ts ev’rythin’ like this.’ (Line 11), which acts as a fishing device

(Pomerantz, 1980). The utterance ‘people keep saying’ constructs a state of knowledge that is

widespread, to the general, unnamed people, making it relevant for CW to now explain

whether this general knowledge is accurate, what help is available, and whether the

constituency office will help C too. C also says that he does not know if this is ‘the best route

to take’, something that CW confirms as he begins to describe what the office can do. Note

that CW expresses it as something he is ‘happy’ (Line 16) to commit to doing, something that

is ‘not a problem’ (Line 15 and 17). As in Extract 4.6 above, in which CW proposed that she

‘can get a list’, the caseworker here also uses ‘can’ to formulate the first offer (“We can

certainly look into it for you”). In contrast, the second offer uses different format: “if we need

to, we’ll happily do so” (Lines 15-16). Both of these proposal-offers offer a potential future

course of action, contingent on the response of the constituent. These offers explain the

abilities of the constituency office, especially given the context built in the preceding turn in

which C makes relevant information about what is possible and whether help will be offered.

However, the relevant acceptance/rejection from C is missing in the following turn (Lines 18 20). Instead, C pursues his own lack of knowledge, saying he does not know ‘what’s best to

do<’ (Line 20), and asks if the office does appointments (Line 21). This turn does not treat

the preceding turn from the caseworker as an offer, but as an insufficient explanation of what

the constituency office does. By continuing to reference his own lack of knowledge and

106

pursuing the question of what the office could do next, C treats his previous fishing device as

incomplete or unsatisfied. CW, however, recycles his offer in Lines 23-28, and does not

address C’s earlier question about what the constituency office does as a service.

As the call unfolds, we can see more evidence that C does want an explanation of what

the office is capable of doing in general. Extract 4.10 comes after C and CW have scheduled

the appointment referenced in Extract 4.9 and CW has given directions to the constituency

office.

Extract 4.10: MP01.Phone-2AH_01 1 C: Okay. Awesome.=UH:M so #uh-e-ih-er# JUSt so I know: what 2 roughly what you guys do, [I mean I’ve (0.2) You know= 3 CW: [Mm, 4 C: =I ’preciate, A lot [a pe]ople keep= 5 CW: [Yea.] 6 C: =saying, con[tact] you,# wha- wha- What= 7 CW: [Yea.] 8 C: =exact(.)ly CAN you do,=or what are the options or 9 [what’s, 10 CW: [Erahhh# WELl- my- my role is a CAseworker, (.) uhm So 11 there’s two caseworkers here.

What is the difference between offering a potential course of action, and explaining a

potential course of action? In Extract 4.9, CW explained potential future courses of action,

but did so with explicit costs and benefits indexed (an explicit example of how ‘benefactive

stance’ could be enacted, Clayman & Heritage, 2014). CW said that the office would ‘look

into for you’ (Ext. 8, Lines 14-15), making it clear that the potential action was for C’s

benefit. CW also referenced the ease of doing the actions, and the willingness of the office to

do the actions, thus indexing a low cost for the office to accomplish this assistance. The

sequential and institutional context (as an agency that purports to help constituents) both

indicate that the ‘can’ formulations were offering, not merely explaining, available

assistance. In Extract 4.10, however, CW is responding to a direct question about what the

constituency office can do as an organization, instead of a troubles-telling, and explains the

107

office’s general abilities, rather than specifically what potential actions could be offered to

the client at hand. While the caseworker still uses ‘can’ (such as in Lines 16-17, ‘we can

write letter:s’), no benefactive stance is indexed. The explanation is characterized by the use

of the present continuous voice, the use of the word ‘often’ (in Line 15, ‘quite Often: coun uhm contact the council’), and the phrase ‘sorts of things’ (such as in Lines 11-12 and 17), all

indicating the general, scripted activities of the office (Edwards, 1994). Extracts 4.9 and 4.10

demonstrate how proposal-like designs (especially including the verb ‘can’) act either as

explanations or as components in an offer. By using the ‘can’ design in turns that are offers,

constituency office staff take advantage of this explanatory feature, combining both the offer

and the explanation of what the constituency office is willing and capable to do for

constituents. This implicit ‘teaching’ of the institutional rules is, as I noted earlier, important

at the constituency office, where constituents often display uncertainty about what the

constituency office can do. Proposal-offers are thus very useful as first offers at the

constituency office, because they simultaneously explain and offer.

In the next section, I consider offers made in the form of announcements, used to repeat

offers made earlier, as well as to renew efforts at assistance already underway.

4.3 Announcement offers

Offers made in the form of an announcement (‘I will do X’) are declarations of future intent.

These offers do not typically make reference to the desires of the constituent nor make a

response to confirm the course of action relevant. They were used to repeat already-made

offers and to renew efforts to assist a client who had already been receiving or promised help.

Announcement-offers were never used to offer a course of action for the first time (again,

‘first’ refers to the sequence of events in dealing with a specific case, rather than temporally

in the interaction). In Extract 4.11, C has called to follow up on his case (a rat infestation at

his council-owned house). C demonstrates that he is a repeat caller from the way he

introduces himself.

Extract 4.11: MP01.Phone-1KK_01 1 C: Uh: as for the housin:’, we’ve not ’eard a peep from them, 2 so we don’t know what they’re:: up t[o,] 3 CW: [iO]h:, ri::ght, okay, 4 .hhh 5 C: So:, I was j’st wondering what the outcome was on the 6 emails that you sent.=I mean obviously: (.) the uh council 7 got the email because .hh when the uh:: pest control man 8 come round he did mention the email from yourse:lf,

108

9 (0.3) 10 CW: Yeah. 11 (0.5) 12 CW: .hh[HH] 13 C: [so] wonderin’ what did that mean. 14 CW: Um: I haven’t heard from them y- the: housing people yet so 15 >I’m afraid sorry about that< I will chase them today::. 16 .hHHH um:::ptk- But- w- HOW’s it going though, is it- is it 17 quieter now: can you hear anything:,

C reports that he has not heard from relevant organizations and wonders if those organizations

have spoken to CW instead (Lines 5-13). CW responds with an apology that she has not heard

from any of the organizations in question, but includes an announcement-offer: ‘I will chase

them today::’ (Line 15). The offer declares what CW intends to do, including when she will

do it. As such, it does not make relevant a response from C and, indeed, none is forthcoming

(in-breath and ‘um’ on Line 16 are a space for at least a minimal acknowledgement). In fact,

none of the typical methods of making a response relevant are present. Interrogativity is one

way to mobilize a response, but CW produces a declarative statement (Schegloff, 1984;

Stivers & Rossano, 2010). Another way to make a response relevant would be to make the

turn a phrase about a B-event (Labov & Fanshel, 1977), by giving information primarily in

the domain of the recipient (e.g., ‘you’ll want me to call them then’) which tends to elicit a

response (Pomertanz, 1980; Heritage & Raymond, 2005; Stivers & Rossano, 2010). Here, the

epistemic domain of the action is constructed as belonging to CW; it is her decision how to

run her day, who to chase, and when she will do it. Finally, interrogative format would also

make a response relevant, such as making it a yes/no interrogative (Raymond, 2003), but that

is not the case either; it is a statement, not a question. So, we are left with the impression that

CW does not expect a response from C, and may even have designed her turn such that the

possibility of a response is reduced. However, we are told (Stivers & Rossano, 2010, p. 5, 26)

that, canonically at least, when the action of offering is done, a response is relevant, typically

an acceptance or rejection. However, unlike the offers in the proposal-offer section above,

CW does not pursue a response. In summary, there are no features that make a response

relevant, no acceptance or rejection is present, and there is no pursuit of a response. Why,

then, call these announcements ‘offers’?

Extract 4.11 fits my definition of an offer in every respect: It displays that the ‘chasing’

that is being promised is for C’s benefit and indeed is happening only because CW has heard

nothing and C is inquiring about the matter. CW displays that she will be the agent of the

activity, and also includes when exactly she will enact this offer. By making an offer, CW

portrays the assistance as a logical outcome of the assistance so far not having worked. It

109

shows a strong willingness and ability to offer help, because it is being announced, rather than

proposed – it is definite, not potential. It also shows that the office is determined to help; in

the face of failure to assist adequately so far, the office may appear to be weak, inept, or not

trying hard enough to be of assistance to the constituent. By announcing further assistance (of

a kind for which permission has already been granted) immediately in the face of this failure,

the office can portray itself as persistent, and reassure the constituent that aid is being pursued

in the process.

Announcement offers are not simply declarations of plans (Suchman, 1987) or unilateral

decisions (Stevanovic, 2012). They still contain the crucial aspects of an offer – displaying

willingness to do an action on behalf of the recipient. Compare, for instance, the following

two extracts. In Extract 4.12, we get a common type of offer (even in non-institutional

contexts, when taking messages on a home landline phone): ‘I’ll take a message for him:’

(Lines 9-10). C has been working with one of the two caseworkers, Jason, but Jason is not

available that day to take the call. Ann, the other caseworker, offers to take the call. This kind

of offer is ubiquitous in telephone conversations, and remains an offer, not an announcement,

because of its focus on the willingness of the offerer to do the action.

Extract 4.12: MP01.Phone-1KZ2_02

1 C: =[It’s] Mrs. Gray’s daily cal[l:.] 2 CW: [O h]: hi Mrs. Gra[y, I uhhh] 3 C: [h’s a bit] 4 different from the last time when I rang,=>this is really< good 5 ne[ws. 6 CW: [.hh hOH: >brilliant oh he< will be sad cause he’s not here:, 7 hh(h)e(h)e 8 C: [hAOH:: what a shame:] 9 CW: [.hhh He’s on a train]ing course in London:, but I’ll take a 10 message for [him:,] 11 C: [All r]ight. Will you Tell ’im I’ve just had a letter 12 this mor::ning,

In contrast, Extract 4.13 is tilted towards making plans.

Extract 4.13: MP01.Phone-1KZ_01 1 CW: =Yea:s. Yes. I see your point, .hhhH Right. Well let me get 2 in contact with them anyway:, U[:m, 3 C: [Yeah, 4 CW: When you’ve put the phone down I’ll do one four seven one 5 an’ get your num:ber, an’ then I’ll get them to:, get in 6 contact with you if I may:, .hh 7 C: Yeah. 8 CW: All ri:[ght,]

110

CW says she will do ‘one four seven one’, which is a way to display the phone number that

has just called. CW intends to do this because C does not know the phone number on which

she is calling. In announcing this intention, however, CW is not emphasizing her willingness

to do the action, nor the beneficiary nature (C does not have to phone back to provide the

phone number). Several minutes earlier in the conversation, she requested permission to use

‘1471’ to get C’s phone number, and this utterance confirms that she still intends to do so. In

Lines 5-6, CW follows up the ‘mere’ announcement of her intended action (using the 1471

telephone function) with an announcement offer, ‘I’ll get them to:, get in contact with you if I

may:’. This latter statement is more than an announcement; it is an announcement offer, as it

indexes CW’s willingness to do the action for C, and seeks permission in a tag statement ‘if I

may’.

Another example of the announcement-offer can be seen in Extract 4.13. In this

conversation, the constituent (C) has been attempting to schedule an appeal date. Although the

difficulty in scheduling is not C’s fault, her benefits have been cancelled. This injustice

brought C to the surgery, and she was promised to hear back within ten days. The ten days

have elapsed without word, so she is calling to see what happened at the constituency office.

Extract 4.14: MP01.Phone-1LB_06

1 C: Hi:, you’al’right?= 2 CW: =Yes not too bad.=n’you, 3 C: Yes fine thank you, .hh um: s’j’s wondering if you’d heard 4 anything cause you’d- uh::m I think you spoke to my husband 5 you said (.) hopefully to be able to tell ’im something 6 within ten da:y[s. 7 CW: [Ee:yeahs le’s [just have- 8 C: [pas’ that nowhh Heh 9 CW: R::ight, Okay. le’s just have a l:oo:k UH::m .hhHH alright 10 lemme jus’ s:ee when I sent it o:ff:, te te te te 11 Tehhh((singing)) on’ one secon::d (.) .hhh I don’t think I 12 have is the short answer to that, 13 C: Mhmm 14 (1.3) 15 CW: uhhum: but let me just checkhh (2.1) .hhhH uhm:::righthh 16 (10.1) 17 CW: °ri::ght so that was sent on the eighteenth° hh an::d t- 18 ten working days .hHHHHH OKAY no I-I’ve not hh’u:m: so um 19 what I’ll- what I can do: is I’ll- I’ll chase ’em up again 20 an’:: just to see if I can get a date for you, 21 C: Oh all right [ okay °°( )°°] 22 CW: [Uhm: So sorry] I’ve not- (.) 23 C: [No tha- ] 24 CW: [Not um::] 25 (.) 26 C: fi:ne (uh wh-) say we’ been ’aving the problem with ’em all 27 the- all the way along at [least it’s bin]= 28 CW: [ih’ y:ea h :: ]

On Lines 18-20, the caseworker (CW) goes through several self-repairs to arrive at an

announcement offer, ‘I’ll chase ’em up again’. It is repeated in ‘I’ll um:: get them tuh .hh tuh

find one for you’ on Lines 32-33). This fits with my previous analysis, as the offer occurs in

an environment where CW already knows what the constituent would like, C knows what the

constituency office has committed to doing and what they are capable of doing, and C has

given her permission for the constituency office to act. A proposal-offer would be

inappropriate, as it would imply that the constituency office has not paid attention to what C

needs them to do. Furthermore, in this instance it would imply that CW had forgotten what he

and the MP had committed to doing in the previous interaction with C: to get the appeals

court to fix a proper date for the tribunal. Using an ‘I will’ statement here helps to portray the

office as not only willing but proactive, and reassuring C of the constituency office’s

commitment to their prior offer by reissuing it in a stronger, more definite manner.

Especially in closings, announcement-offers are used to reiterate what has been offered

so far, as a way of committing to the plans for assistance that have been set out during the

interaction. For example, in Extract 4.15, the caseworker (CW) is just finishing taking down

the constituent’s (C) phone number.

Extract 4.15: MP01.Phone-1KS_02 1 CW: Two one two three. .hh Right. Okay, I’ll email her straight 2 away an’ come back to you when I’ve got an’ answer,=all 3 ri:ght, 4 C: Thank you [very much, 5 CW: [Thanks then, [Buh bye 6 C: [Okay buh bye

Here, CW initiates closing, and as part of doing so, she repeats the offer that she has already

made in this interaction: to email a specific council officer. Many closing portions of calls and

surgeries include a component like this one, in which the offer, or offers, that have been given

during that interaction are repeated for final evaluation and commitment.

To summarize, in this section I have shown that ‘I will’ is used to produce

announcement-offers, in which the offer is declared as a definite action, not requiring the

112

input or acquiescence of the constituent. These turns should be considered as offers rather

than statements of planning or intent because of the beneficiary nature for the recipient. These

offers are often used when speaking to repeat constituents who have returned to the office

with the same problem still active. They are also used during closings to reiterate what the

future plans are for the constituent’s case. In the final section, I will focus on ‘request-offers’,

a style of offer that blurs the line between requesting and offering actions.

4.4 Request-offers: “Let me…”

After proposal-offers and announcement-offers have been made, another offer format

occasionally appears, which involves requesting constituents to do (or not to do) something in

order that the offer can be fulfilled. The most common way to do this is using the phrase ‘let

me’. In Extract 4.16, the constituent (C) has been complaining about a longstanding

neighbour dispute. Another agency told him to go and speak with his neighbour but C is

fearful about making an approach.

Extract 4.16: MP01.Phone-14AE_01 1 C: An’ I mean he might’ve BIT me on the no:se, 2 CW: Ye:s, ye:s, 3 C: So I- e- they just not- they just don’t Care:. 4 CW: .hh[H Right, ] 5 C: [Cause Nobo]dy Ca:res. 6 (0.3) 7 CW: O:kay. Well, .hh I- I wo- I would HOpefully (.) Disagree 8 with that. Ay- I (.) do think that I’m talking to do 9 ca:re, .hhh u:m but it is just taking them a bit of time 10 to get it sorted.=But- .hh LEt Me Do chase them again. 11 That’s absolutely fine to do that, S’no problem at 12 all:,=As I- as I say I thought it was resol:ved, .hh[hH 13 C: [No no.

On Lines 1-5, C expresses frustration with the agencies he has been dealing with. The

caseworker (CW) tries to reassure C that, at least at her end, some people at some agencies

‘do ca:re’ (Lines 8-9), even if it is taking ‘a bit of time’ (Line 9) to fix the problem. On Line

10, CW reissues her offer to track down the relevant agencies to try to resolve the problem

faster, saying ‘LEt Me Do chase them again.’ By using ‘let me X’ (with additional emphasis

from ‘Do’), CW formats her turn so that it strongly prefers an acceptance. It not only requests

inactivity from C, but promises aid if he says yes. CW mitigates any potential interpretation of

burden on Lines 11-12, by saying that it is ‘absolutely fine’ and ‘S’no problem at all:’, which

further helps reduce the possibility that C will reject the offer.

113

The formulation ‘let me’ breaks down the boundary between an offer and a request. On

the one hand, ‘let me’ requests (or even commands) that the constituent do (or rather, not do)

something, by issuing a directive. On the other, it proposes to benefit C by providing

assistance. These offers were instrumental in creation the definition set out in the

introduction: the beneficiary is largely the constituent, the caseworker is largely one who will

enact the offered action, but there is extra work being done here which should not invalidate

this turn’s basic status as an offer. To understand this extra work, we need to step further back

in this phone call. Almost 100 lines earlier than Extract 4.16, CW makes her initial offer of

assistance. By this point in the call, C has established himself as a repeat client, whose case

has continued for over two years without resolution. Besides the frustration that he has

expressed about this delay, CW did not remember who he was at the beginning of the call.

She has also made it clear that the office does not have the correct information about C’s case,

and so thought it was already resolved. Once C has corrected CW, the following lines occur.

On Lines 1-2, CW issues the first offer of the call, ‘I will also raise it again with the council’.

The call has now been established as a repeat call, so the format of ‘I will’ makes sense, as

C’s permission has already been sought, and given the frustration C is experiencing, a definite

offer is appropriate. In response, C jokes that he is still chasing this issue, and goes on to

make a case for needing assistance: he is elderly, needs protection (Line 13), pays his rates

(i.e., his rent and taxes, Lines 15-17), and although he considered not paying his rates in

protest (Lines 17-22), he has not yet taken this drastic step. CW recommends against that

idea, and then at Line 27, reissues the offer, this time in a ‘let me’ format. This formulation

may be an attempt to manage C’s expressed frustration. By strongly preferring an acceptance,

CW attempts to get C ‘on side’ with the offered course of action. There is no question of his

permission any more, but it is important that he be satisfied with the help he is receiving. C’s

acceptance of the offer is required, both to demonstrate the acceptability of the suggested

offer, and to stop C from continued complaining, which is preventing CW from getting off the

phone and putting the offer into action.

By not accepting the offer in Line 1, C displays resistance to the offer. Such resistance

has been documented elsewhere, especially in medical interactions (Toerien et al., 2011;

Stivers, 2005; Heritage & Sefi, 1992; Hepburn & Potter, 2011a). In this respect, caseworkers

offering courses of action are similar to doctors offering courses of treatment. In both

contexts, the client is responsible for accepting or declining the offer, and this response carries

the client’s permission and ‘buy-in’ to the suggested process. Here, C displays resistance by

not responding to the offer (Lines 5 and 6, delay on 36), by continuing to provide arguments

for needing assistance despite having been made an offer (Lines 9-10, 13, 15-22), by

negatively assessing the work so far (Line 24), and by otherwise only giving minimal

acknowledgements that something has been said (e.g., Line 37) instead of more strongly

aligning phrases (see Stivers, 2005, 2008). CW, faced with non-aligning turns, makes the

offer again, on Line 27. The ‘let me’ formulation can be seen as an attempt to respond to the

new arguments for assistance; to suggest that in order to provide help, C needs to let CW get

to work, and to more strongly make an acceptance relevant. In Extract 4.16 above, we can see

that CW reissues the ‘let me’ offer later on in the call. In fact, she does it yet again (in data

not shown) before she receives an acceptance, shortly before the end of the call. The ‘let me’

115

formulation both manages resistance by strongly preferring an acceptance (almost as if it were

a request instead of an offer), and highlights that the ‘burden’ of the action will be undertaken

by the caseworker. Although Extract 4.16 and 4.17 demonstrate that the ‘let me’ format is not

necessarily immediately effective (given how long it takes to get C to let CW fulfil the offer),

this is particularly agitated case. This format appears in other calls and meetings as well, but

is the least common of the three formats considered in this paper – an unsurprising finding,

given that constituents are usually eager to accept any help from the constituency office that is

offered. It is only in cases where the office has had significant difficulty in finding an

appropriate or successful course of action to offer that the ‘let me’ formulation arises. The ‘let

me’ formulation creates a hybrid scenario: the format of a request, but the action of an offer of

assistance.

In this section, I have shown how ‘let me’ offers blur the boundary between offer and

request, as they request that constituents do something (or do nothing) in order to allow an

offer to be fulfilled. However, these are still offers because they benefit (largely) the recipient,

and are enacted by the offerer. These offers are used to help manage constituent resistance to

courses of action.

4.5 Discussion

In this chapter, I have investigated how turns accomplish ‘offering’ at the constituency office.

The MP and caseworkers use different offer designs at specific points, and these different

designs accomplish additional work than ‘mere’ offering. Proposal-offers (e.g., ‘I can do X

for you’ and ‘do you want’) are designed to highlight the need for permission and make

acceptance relevant. They are the first offers given concerning a problem. The next offers are

typically announcement-offers (e.g., ‘I will do X’), which re-state and confirm that an agreed

upon offer will take place. These offers are often used at the close of a topic or the close of an

encounter, as a way of summarizing what offers have been made. They also highlight what

action will take place in the future, hence their similarity to expressions of plans or intent.

Finally, request-offers (‘let me do X’) are a hybrid of requesting and offering, in which the

staff request (or direct) constituents to do (or cease doing) something so that the offer can be

completed. These offers are used during lengthy complaints to attempt to close down a topic.

I have not considered yet how these offers form part of a series, such as the kind of

action series discussed in Schegloff (2007, pp. 207-215). This is because the offers in my

dataset do not consistently belong to a series. A few offers discussed in this paper (Extracts

4.3, 4.6, 4.13, 4.15, 4.16, and 4.17) are part of a series of offers issued by the staff, which

116

move the trajectory of the project of assistance toward a mutually acceptable course of action.

Some of these issue new offered actions (such as calling different agencies, or researching

different areas), and some involve reissuing the same action (most easily seen in Extracts 4.16

and 4.17). This latter version involves switching the format to ‘request offers’, as a way of

managing resistance. Other extracts show first offers in an interaction, although second or

third offers concerning the proposed assistance (Extracts 4.11 and 4.14), and there are some

that are later in an interaction but first concerning the course of action (Extract 4.2, 4.4, 4.5,

4.7, 4.9, and 4.12), the latter of which all fall into my category of ‘proposal offers’, since they

are first offers of an offered action. Schegloff’s series thus overlap with how I characterize the

data, but my analysis more accurately and specifically portrays what the offers are

accomplishing in my data corpus.

Furthermore, while the series explored in Schegloff (2007) are temporally and

sequentially close to each other, many of the offers presented here were related to topics

discussed days or weeks prior, albeit by the same participants. Although the speaking roles

(who issued the first or second pair part of the offer) remained the same (which is due to the

institutional nature of the data) over time, it did not seem appropriate to label offers from

separate interactions as part of the same series.

In the introduction to this chapter, I reviewed the way conversation analysts have

previously defined and described offers-in-interaction. My empirical observations are most

aligned with Couper-Kuhlen (2014)’s definition that offers are proposed actions that benefit

the recipient and are carried out by the speaker. However, I suggest that this is not a clearly

demarcated distinction; both parties must take some action, even if it is only providing

permission (and, in the case of request-offers, it is sometimes necessary to withhold action, in

order for an offer to be completed), and the benefits resulting from an offer can be shared.

Furthermore, the turn designs I have reported frequently blur the lines between a prototypical

offer and other actions, such as proposals, announcements, and requests (which are often

stated to be the polar opposite and dispreferred alternative to offers – see Schegloff, 2007;

Kendrick & Drew, 2014). Therefore, the offers I have analyzed support Sacks’s (1992)

suggestion that requests, offers, proposals, threats, and so on, should be considered as part of

a continuum of possible actions, rather than as opposites, or discrete concepts. Sidnell and

Enfield (2014, p.433) have also argued against the categorization of actions, pointing out

117

a hearer does not need to classify an action as being of a certain type in order to now

how to deal with it. A hearer uses the components of a move to figure out on the fly an

appropriate response to a particular token move. (emphasis original)

In other words, the constituents are able to parse the MP and caseworkers’ offers as more than

solely offers; participants can assign more than one action to a turn, and appreciate the

nuances that turn design components bring to each utterance (for a different context, see

Mandelbaum, 2014). To attempt to categorize and delineate specific action types (as in

Couper-Kuhlen, 2014) is to lose analytic purchase on the very nuances that participants are

quite adept at understanding. Analyzing actions as fluid possibilities, rather than discrete

categories, enhances our understanding of how and why participants use different

formulations. As Schegloff (1997a) writes, “boundary cases are the sparks struck by the

collision of two analytic practices” (p.539); making room for grey zones between and among

actions demonstrates points at which more interactional work is being accomplished.

Considering actions as part of a continuum or spectrum will likely prove useful beyond

institutional data, as a more flexible conceptualization of action achievement in mundane talk

as well.

I have shown in this thesis that participants have a use for making offers in several

different formats. Proposal-offers allow caseworkers to gather more information about the

case, and seek the institutional pre-requisite of permission. Announcement-offers allow

caseworkers and politicians to appear proactive and helpful. Request-offers give caseworkers

the ability to pursue permission and alignment with constituents. Yet these actions all still

remain offers, as indicated by the beneficiary nature of the promised action. They are

evidence that participants are not constrained to particular action categories, but use the

matrix of options available to the advantage of whatever their communication needs happen to

be, and conversation analysts should take care to allow for the flexibility in action formation

that we observe.

In the previous two chapters, I have focused on the service transactions at the

constituency office – the process of describing needs and offering help. These transactions

comprised the majority of the topics discussed at the office and the majority of the time in the

encounters. In the next chapter, I will address a more rarely raised topic: politics, political

parties, and government policy. Although these topics were rarely raised, the presence of a

politician at this institution makes a discussion of political comments relevant.

118

Chapter 5:

Making ‘politics’ relevant: How constituents and a Member of Parliament

raise political topics at constituency surgeries

5.0 Introduction

In this chapter, I will examine how ‘political’ topics become relevant in constituency office

encounters. Although one might imagine that constituents and politicians talk entirely about

political issues at constituency offices, given that this is the only opportunity for constituents

to meet in person with their democratic representatives, we have seen in previous chapters

that constituents primarily come for help with local disputes and what they regard as

bureaucratic red tape. Despite the MP being arguably the prototypical political figure, the

data in this corpus do not provide many instances of clearly political talk (although the

question of what constitutes ‘political talk’ is itself interesting; see Section 5.1). In this

chapter, I will analyze the occasions of political talk that do occur, and discuss the challenges

participants face in raising political topics. In Section 5.1, I will discuss how I came to

identify sequences of ‘political’ talk. In Section 5.2, I will analyze the sequences in which I

found the MP to make ‘political’ topics relevant. In Section 5.3, I will analyze sequences in

which I found constituents to initiate politically-relevant sequences, namely criticisms. In

Section 5.4, I will analyze how constituents may come to compliment the MP with respect to

political activity. This latter, deviant case shows that constituents privilege the interactional

contingencies of encounters with a politician over a possible desire to make a political

statement. Overall, this chapter highlights the importance of considering the interactional

norms to which speakers orient, as I will show how those norms impact constituents’ ability

to raise political criticisms. This chapter will be of interest to those studying political

discourse and conversation, even in more mundane settings (Ekström, 2016; Eveland, Morey

& Hutchens, 2011; Schmitt-Beck & Lup, 2013), as it demonstrates the insight that analysis of

actual recordings can bring to our understanding of how to achieve talk as political.

5.1 What is ‘political’?

There is a vast literature that attempts to define what counts as ‘political’ (see Section 1.1;

Leftwich, 2004; van Dijk, 1997), which cannot be covered fully here, but few of these

definitions are capable of defining how a stretch of interaction can be identified as ‘political’,

119

let alone what practices members use to achieve a sense of ‘political’ in an interaction. I did

not treat the ‘mere’ context of being at the constituency office of a Member of Parliament as

sufficient for labeling the interactions as political, for several reasons. First, as discussed in

Chapter 1, most political discourse literature does not treat the constituency office as a

political environment. Second, as this is a conversation analytic study, CA does not treat a

context as any specific type of interaction (e.g., ‘political’) unless participants invoke or do

work to make the talk so. Given that no constituents did work to show that their visit to the

constituency office was for the express purpose of discussing policy, elections, or the MP’s

job, the political topics were ‘buried’ in other conversational activities, and work was

required to extract or make plain the political aspect of a turn. Third, given the lack of current

research determining how everyday citizens invoke a sense of ‘political’ in the presence of

their MP, I believe it is more interesting to analyze the data for how participants achieved

‘political’ sequences, or not, and any challenges they faced in doing so.

The sequences of talk that are considered political here rely on Hay’s (2007, pp.54-81)

definition, wherein an issue can be characterized as political by highlighting the ways in

which agency and deliberation were a part of the issue. In other words, talk makes a topic

political (talk ‘politicizes’ the topic) by highlighting how some entity made (or could make)

choices about the topic. Hay’s definition is especially useful as it avoids the requirement that

talk be ‘political’ by virtue of having the goal of some political end – which is one common

way to distinguish what is political or not (Dingwall, 2000; van Dijk, 1997). CA does not

assume analysts have access to any mental states such as ‘goals’. After all, it may be that

every constituent that visited this constituency office had some mental goal that was political,

that every complaint about bureaucratic red tape was implicitly also a criticism of

government policy about benefits. But to claim that there were political goals in the minds of

constituents without clearly demonstrating said goals would be unscientific. We can only be

certain of a political agenda when it is made evident, just as the participants could only be

certain of a political agenda on the part of their interlocutors when such an agenda was made

evident in the conversation. Hay’s definition also avoids the requirement of attributing

power, as an abstract attribute, to one participant over another (common in political

definitions such as Nicholson, 2004; Swift, 2004), which also remains true to the inductive

conversation analytic method (for useful discussions of power in relation to CA, see

Dingwall, 2000; Hepburn & Potter, 2011a; Nishizaka, 1992; Schegloff, 1997b). In this

chapter, I focus on how the choices of larger scale, traditional political entities were made

relevant – government, politicians, and political parties. These were the instances that most

120

strongly invoked a common-sense notion of ‘political’. Moreover, these matched the

participants’ concern for emphasizing, or de-emphasizing, who was accountable for a policy,

or for a situation. Participants showed an orientation towards the MP’s accountability even

when it was indirect.

Hay’s (2007) definition can permit an analysis of how the constituents’ choices (for

instance, whether or not to apply for benefits, what items to purchase while in poverty, or

when to complain) could be politicized, but both for space reasons and for less quantity of

data, this analysis has been saved for future research. The micro-scale choices embedded in

the interaction itself (whether to offer assistance, what assistance to offer, whether to accept

or resist, etc.) could also be politicized, but this begins to overlap extensively with the basic

concerns of response relevance and action ascription in CA, and again, fails to address the

more interesting question of how talk can be achieved as political, and when and where

participants choose to do so. Note that I will not address the question of ‘face’ (Bull & Fetzer,

2010; Goffman, 1967), as there was not ample evidence to indicate that ‘facework’ was a

participants’ concern (Arundale, 2006, 2010; Benwell & Stokoe, 2002). In order to show the

way a sequence was achieved as ‘political’, and how it arises as a participants’ concern, I will

also include analysis of an extract that was possibly political, but was not fully achieved as

such (see Extract 5.7, Section 5.3). In the final section, I will show a counter-example

(Section 5.4) of how constituents compliment (instead of criticize) the MP’s government, and

how the practices for complimenting are significantly different than the practices for

criticizing.

I found that the MP initiated political topics in order to show that the government and

his political party were aligned with constituents’ interests. In the next section, I will analyze

how the MP initiated political topics and made the political relevant.

5.2 How the Member of Parliament initiated political talk

In the first analytic section, I will analyze how the MP raises political topics and makes

political comments. The MP’s comments are direct references to political activity in

government (i.e., to the majority, governing party’s policies and activity), and show proactive

behaviour on the part of the government that is aligned with the constituents’ interests.

When constituents present a complaint, the MP can treat that complaint as politically

relevant, and make a political comment. The MP can raise reports of details about current

House of Commons proceedings or plans, for instance. By raising a political topic or issue,

the MP treats the prior turn(s) as political and/or politically relevant turn(s). For example, in

121

the first extract, the constituents (C1 and C2) and MP have been discussing elder care homes

in the United Kingdom (UK). The constituents’ mother was seriously neglected in her care

home, and the constituents want their mother’s legacy to be preventing further abuse and

neglect. The constituents have been suggesting possible problems with the system in the

meeting, and are currently expressing concern about the lack of trained care home staff.

Extract 5.1: MP01.Surgery-2CXx_05 1 MP: An’ they’re al:ready saying, (0.2) they can’t 2 afford to run, (0.5) 3 [uhm with what they’re] doing, 4 C1: [°But they’re paying-°] They’re paying 5 the minimu[m wage] °don’t they,°= 6 MP: [I know.] =Well that’s 7 the trouble an’ then it- 8 C1: You kno[w:, 9 MP: [So, (.) they pay the minimum wa:ge, 10 They attract people who are (0.2) only prepared 11 to work for, (.) you know, 12 C1: Yeah, 13 MP: Minimum wage, (0.2) An’ therefore th- the- the 14 people say:, th- the care homes will say:, say 15 to- say to me, ‘well actually there’s no 16 point#, °you know (les-) they- they’re-° 17 turnover is- .hhh 18 MP: It’s a vicious circle.

This extract shows how a complaint develops slowly into a politically oriented sequence. The

extract starts with C1 and C2 resisting the MP’s concerns. The MP expresses concern on

122

behalf of the elder care homes (ECHs) that they cannot afford to run. C1 counters (literally

proposing an alternative with ‘but’, Line 4) that the ECHs pay minimum wage. The MP

aligns with C1 (‘I know’, Line 6), and explains the dilemma facing the ECHs (Lines 6-20).

The MP concludes his explanation by suggesting that the problem is broader than the

concerns of the constituents – that it is ‘a hbi:g problem in this country’ (Lines 18-20), and

thus goes beyond the ECH of the constituents’ mother. At this point, the MP’s explanation

has not directly affiliated with the constituents’ concerns, but has diverged to address the

broader, social-scale difficulties. C2, then, does not respond to these broader implications,

and pursues affiliation for the complaint about the lack of training (Lines 19-23) (Jefferson &

Lee, 1992). This resists the MP’s explanation (Hepburn & Potter, 2011b). C2’s complaint

more strongly pursues affiliation by formulating the concern as something that anybody

would feel (‘>you wouldn’t want’ Line 19; ‘you wouldn’t have’ Line 21). C2 also mobilizes

response (Stivers & Rossano, 2010) with other strategies, such as the tag-question ‘would

you’ (Line 25), and the extreme case formulation contrast of a baby and an elderly person

(Lines 22-29). These kinds of complaint-pursuing environments, in which constituents

continually pursue affiliation for a certain complaint, or repeat a complaint, can result in

political comments from the MP.

The MP now affiliates with the constituents more strongly. First, the MP agrees with

them: ‘No’ (Line 24). Note that the ‘No’ is an agreement in that it shows the MP to be of a

similar opinion, that you would not want an untrained person caring for a baby. Second, the

MP uses a political comment to demonstrate how he and his government have been

proactively engaging with this issue already. On Lines 30-36, the MP mentions that the

government is discussing ‘the care bill’ (Line 33) in a few days’ time, which shows that they

are aware of the issue, are actively trying to find a way to fix the issue, and that they have

already been preparing for the bill in the recent past. The MP also designs his turn so that the

political activity directly addresses C2’s turn: ‘An’ that’s where we (.) are trying to get to’

(Line 30-31). The ‘An’ that’ (and) indexes how the utterance arises out of C2’s complaint, as

if C2 has coincidentally formulated precisely what the government has been doing. In this

way, the MP’s turn not only fulfills the relevant affiliation with C2, it also shows him to be

proactively and independently helping the constituents. As Edwards and Fasulo (2006) have

pointed out, demonstrating independence highlights the sincerity of the position.

Extract 5.1 shows how a political comment can be slowly developed, from possible political topics such as the country-wide relevance of an issue, to more specific, overt

political topics such as debating bills. The extract also shows how the MP can mobilize a

123

potential political sequence of talk to demonstrate an affiliative, shared position with the

constituents – but also that said position is genuine, and independently claimed, since it is

based on already-undertaken government activity. This kind of positioning could be very

useful for a politician who needs to demonstrate how well they represent constituents and

how they are actively assisting constituents, in order to keep their job in the next election.

Extract 5.1 also demonstrates initial differences between conversations at the

constituency office and conversations in citizen participation shows (see Section 1.3.2).

Firstly, the constituents are not mediated by a host. They are able to pursue concerns,

contrary to findings in radio and TV settings (Ekström & Eriksson, 2013; Ekström &

Moberg, 2015; Thornborrow & Fitzgerald, 2013). Secondly, the constituents do not pursue

the MP’s responsibilities through accountability questions, as in political interviews

(Clayman & Heritage, 2002b; Djerf-Pierre, Ekström & Johansson, 2013; Ekström, 2009;

Ekström, Djerf-Pierre, Johansson, Håkansson, 2015). In fact, the MP’s personal

accountability is not raised, and the constituents focus on the accountability of the care home.

One aspect mirrors political interviews: depoliticization of an issue and the explicit

invocation of government policy is what closes the topic. At first, the constituents portray the

care home’s choices of who to hire and how much to pay as questionable and accountable,

which politicizes said choices by suggesting other ones would be better. The MP

depoliticizes these choices by saying they are caught in a ‘vicious circle’ (Line 18), in other

words that there is no choice, and the difficulties are inevitable. When the constituents further

pursue the issue, with their comparison to nursery care, the MP invokes current legislation

being debated in Parliament, and this closes the topic. Depoliticization and invocation of

current measures are tactics used in interviews (Ekström et al., 2015, p.12; Hay, 2007) to

achieve answers without giving promises. The work done to make politics explicit closes the

topic. The constituents minimally accept the MP’s proposal that the new bill will bring a

better outcome (Lines 42-43), without challenging it, and move on to the next topic.

The MP-initiated political comments follow the above pattern – explicit invocation of

government, aligning with constituent interests, and changing or closing the topic. Extract 5.2

demonstrates this. In Extract 5.2, the constituent (C) has come to the MP to report an incident

of legal aid fraud. Legal aid is a government program that supports low income families with

the costs of solicitors and lawyers. It also had its funding dramatically cut by the government

shortly before the recording. He and his family have unwittingly been a part of a law firm’s

fraudulent activity. After explaining (over eight minutes, from the start of the meeting) how

124

his family came to be involved and how the firm had hidden the details from them, C

broadens his complaint to a society-wide concern.

Extract 5.2: MP01.Surgery-1KZ3_02 1 C: Now, (0.3) What I’m saying is, (.) >a- How 2 many< people are th- doing this towards, They 3 just- e- Sur:ely it’s ilLegal. 4 (0.9) 5 C: If they knew, (0.5) there was a- (.) a problem 6 in the first place, (0.3) I’d a said- “Okay, 7 (.)

It is C, here, who first broaches the topic of wider social relevance. On Lines 1-3, he

intensifies his concern about the law firm, suggesting that they have not only dealt

fraudulently with him, but perhaps with many other people. C neutralizes his own

involvement, claiming he would have said ‘I’ll accept that,’ (Line 7), before continuing to

pursue the complaint (Line 15). C has been pursuing his issue for eight minutes, the last three

of which have involved direct complaints about the company. Thus, we are in a similar

environment as in Extract 5.1, where a complaint is being pursued, and the broader social

implications have been mentioned. This is a sufficient context for the MP to treat the

sequence as politically relevant.

The MP’s comment, Lines 16-19, highlights the way that his own government has

proactively managed the problem of legal aid fraud, by dramatically reducing it. The MP

specifically includes ‘as a government (0.5) we’ (Lines 16-17), which inserts into his turn

both the role of the government, and the MP’s role within that government in accomplishing

the fix for legal aid fraud. In Hay’s (2007) terms, it highlights the (government level)

politicization of the decision to stop legal aid. The MP goes on to demonstrate a shared

125

knowledge of the problems of the fraud, such as in ‘lots of people were,< as you say making

money (0.4) out of the tax payer’ (Lines 21-24). Including the ‘as you say’ helps to indicate,

as was done in Extract 5.1, the way the MP shares C’s knowledge and opinion, and the way

that the political comment arises out of C’s own talk. Not only does this show the MP to be

on-side with C, it mitigates a possible hearing of this line as preaching or campaigning –

taking the opportunity to discuss things not directly in the constituent’s realm of concern.

The MP treats C’s assessment of ‘There’s too much <waste.>’ (Line 20) as an

agreement, and continues to describe the issues with legal aid. As such, the question of

stopping legal aid acts as a transition to a new topic, which continues for some time after

Extract 5.2. Again we see that raising political topics can transition away from a complaint

sequence – by showing the MP and his government are aligned with the constituents’

interests, and by raising a new topic of discussion.

Extract 5.3 presents a third and final example of MP-initiated political comments. It

will show that while the MP remains consistent in the way he raises political topics, the topic

shift does not always move past the complaint. There are still ways for constituents to pursue

their complaint, despite the MP’s attempt to show that the government is already trying to

manage the issue. In this extract, the constituent (C) is visually impaired, and is visiting with

a companion (V) who she met through a group that volunteers for the blind. Both have been

discussing the difficulties raised by recent benefit changes that were brought into effect by

the MP’s government. Here, V raises the issue of finding work when visually impaired,

which is done to support the idea that C is not malingering or lazily taking benefits – she has

no choice as she cannot get a job.

Extract 5.3: MP01.Surgery-1KZ3_04 1 V: I think one thing’s been- that’s been really 2 commendable about Amy is:, You have tried to find, 3 (0.4) you know, (0.2) <volunteering jobss,> 4 haven’t you in the pa[st, 5 C: [°Yeah, I did 6 [some volunteering°° 7 V: [An’ the first thing that (.)

V complains about the challenge of finding work when disabled, given that even able-bodied

people are having difficulty at the time of recording, due to the economic climate. The MP

confirms V’s version (Line 25), and then raises a current initiative that a co-member of

government is running to help employ people with disabilities. As before, the MP’s raising of

an explicitly political initiative positions himself and his government as aligned with the

constituent. The MP describes this initiative at length, beyond the end of Extract 5.3, and

receives no verbal uptake from C or V (the first clear opportunity for an acknowledgement or

continuer being Line 30, during the MP’s in-breath). When C does respond, it is to tell a story

about a painful experience in applying for a job.

127

91 CW: Wha::[t? 92 MP: [hhhDID HE SAY hhhhTHA:iT. C’s story (Lines 64-89) is a nuanced sequence. On the one hand, it is aligned with the MP’s

prior turns, in that it smoothly continues the sequence concerning the employment strategy.

C’s starts her turn with a receptive ‘Yeah o’cour:se.’ (Line 64) and then prefacing the story

with ‘I mean’ (Line 64). Both of these turn components portray the ensuing story as arising

from prior talk, and as aligned with the MP’s explanation of the government strategy. The

story could be interpreted to support the need for the strategy, given the negative reaction C

received from the prospective employer. On the other hand, the story also pursues the issue

of not being able to find a job, by providing direct evidence of the problem. It returns to the

prior complaint raised by V in Extract 5.3, challenging the MP’s account that the government

is managing the difficulties faced by people with disabilities. In other words, C is pursuing

her complaint and her criticism of government policy, despite the MP’s attempt at reassuring

C in Extract 5.3. C gives an example of the discrimination she faces as a person with a

disability seeking a job. This example gets C’s difficulties on record – difficulties that

implicitly criticize the government’s policies as inadequate for helping people with

disabilities. The story shows evidence of C’s difficulties, thus supporting C’s original

complaint, without continuing to directly criticize the MP or government policy. Indeed, it is

designed to be hearable as arising from and supporting the MP’s talk (see Line 64, ‘Yeah

o’cour:se, .hhh I mean’…), despite the critical work it accomplishes. However, the story still

does not directly call the MP to account, suggesting that C is balancing the pursuit of a

complaint with the interactional difficulties of challenging the MP more directly (as would be

seen on a news interview; see Section 5.3).

In this section, I have shown how political comments arise out of sequences that

involve complaints, and sequences that may have referenced a wider social implication of the

constituents’ specific concern. The MP takes the opportunity to make the talk politically

relevant by demonstrating how he and/or his government have taken action on the issue. The

references to government are direct and specific, and portray the government in a positive

light – as aligned with the constituents’ interests and concerns. Beyond the overt references to

government, it is notable how the government is granted agency in these sequences.

Governments are colloquially thought of as non-agents – as an ineffective group of people

who usually fail to enact anything at all (Hay, 2007). Highlighting the agency of the

government politicizes the government’s actions in and of itself, according to Hay (2007),

128

suggesting that these sequences involve political action for their politicizing nature, not just

their explicit references to mainstream political bodies.

The explicit and positive nature of the MP’s political comments shows a marked

contrast with the comments from constituents. In the next section, I will analyze constituent initiated comments, where constituents must carefully manage the interactional challenge of

criticizing a co-present person.

5.3 How constituents’ initiate political talk

Constituents’ comments are quite different from the MP’s, in that when they raise political

topics, they mostly speak vaguely and with markers of delicacy such as hesitations (see

Silverman & Peräkylä, 1990). Constituents also mostly criticize government action or policy,

thus portraying it in a negative light, and not as aligned with their interests. When

constituents compliment the MP (see Section 5.4), they do not have markers of delicacy, and

speak specifically.

The first example of constituent-initiated political talk is seen in Extract 5.5. Near the

time of recording, the government had implemented two policies. First, it had implemented a

system for assessing benefit claimants to determine their eligibility, which was controversial

(Litchfield, 2014). In this extract, the constituent (C1) has multiple sclerosis, and has been

told he is ineligible for benefits. C1 appealed this assessment, but the appeal kept being

delayed and C1’s benefits had been cancelled anyway, so C1 and his wife (C2) have come to

see the MP for aid. The second government policy was to increase the age at which one could

receive state pension (see Department of Work and Pensions 2014). A pension would have

allowed the constituents more financial flexibility in the face of the benefits cancellation, and

so the lack of pension is a complainable and frustrating matter. C2 complains about this

second change to the caseworker (CW) and the MP on lines 9 and 10.

Extract 5.5: MP01.Surgery-13KO_01 1 C2: I’ve had to go back to working five days, 2 CW: R:ight o[kay. Yea:h. Yeah. 3 C2: [Ahheh heh ba(h)si(h)c’ly cause °I 4 haven’t got money coming° [in an:’ uh: ] 5 CW: [Yeah o‘course yeah] 6 C2: °°You know:,°° ‘[mean I’m s]ixty, 7 CW: [<M k a y ] 8 (0.4) 9 C2: Nearly, an’ (.) obviously our pension’s been 10 hmoved [hhnow hasn’t it, (h)eh(h)eh= 11 MP: [Yeah:, I know::, I know:.= 12 C2: =[hhhhhahhh ]

129

13 MP: =[I know- Well::] >unfortunately< [as you kn]ow= 14 C2: [You know,] 15 MP: =everyone’s- having ta- you know, 16 C2: Mm, 17 (0.3) 18 MP: We’re trying to sort out uh:, you know the big 19 black hole, an:d everybody’s °°impacting on 20 ( )°° 21 C2: Yeah 22 MP: °°( ) Enough.°° [So, 23 C2: [That’s right. Yeah. 24 MP: °An:’ you know and uh but basically, (0.4) 25 Difficult- difficult choices. 26 C2: Yea[h. 27 MP: [An’ pensions has been- has been one of 28 them, 29 C2: Mm. 30 MP: So, uh:m, 31 C2: But I say this is just

C2 starts with a complaint about having to work extra hours, which transforms into a political

issue, on Lines 9-10, ‘Obviously our pension’s been hmoved hhnow hasn’t it’. This comment

makes the recent policy change about pensions relevant to the discussion, and creates a

potential space for the MP to respond to it as a political comment (which he does, see below).

C2’s comment is built up as a pursuit of a complaint, as we have seen before, giving

additional evidence (having to go back to work longer, Line 1, being too old, Line 6) for why

the constituents’ situation is difficult and in need of assistance. The use of ‘Obviously’ and

the tag question ‘hasn’t it’ (Lines 9-10) make it difficult to disagree with the statement

(Hepburn & Potter, 2011b). However, C2 also builds markers of delicacy into her talk. The

role of the government is left entirely implicit – the pensions have ‘been hmoved’ (Lines 9 10), and the agent who did the moving is left unspoken (remember: the agent who did the

moving was the MP’s political party). There are laughter particles managing the problematic

nature of not having sufficient funds (Line 3, see Potter & Hepburn, 2010b), as well as post completion laughter particles (Line 10, see Shaw, Hepburn & Potter, 2013) managing the

implied criticism of the MP. There are also significant pitch changes (Line 10) and low

volume sections (Line 6), which also mark delicacy (Silverman & Peräkylä, 1990). Finally,

the criticism is delayed to the end of the account of why the constituents are struggling. These

are indicators of a delicate situation, used to manage the potentially problematic

interpretations that may be available to the participants. In other words, C2 designs her turns

that culminate in a political comment with speech markers that are regularly reported to

manage interpersonally sensitive topics and actions. This suggests that C2 is careful, when

making such a comment, to mitigate risks associated with doing such an action. In

130

complaining about a situation brought about by the very party to which the MP belongs, C2

risks criticizing the MP directly (Sacks 1992, p.795). As a result, C2 takes steps to reduce this

implication, while simultaneously indicating that she is aware of it.

C2 does not go on record with an accusation (or even a direct statement) about the

MP’s behaviour, or about the MP’s party’s decisions or actions. As noted above (Section

5.2), this is unlike the reported practices in other interactions with politicians, namely in

political interviews (Clayman & Heritage, 2002a; Eriksson, 2011; Ekström, 2009; Ekström et

al., 2015; Heritage, 2002). C2 is not adversarial, and delays the more hostile negative

interrogative tag question until the end of her turn (Line 10). Also unlike news interviews, C2

accepts the MP’s explanation (see below), by giving continuing tokens (15, 20, 25, 27),

treating it as sufficient.

It is worth noting that the complaint is displaced (Edwards, 2005) – it is tangential to

the main complaint, the issue of the appeal about benefits. C2 would not be trouble-free even

if the pension had not been moved. The comment provides another account for why the

constituents are in need of the MP’s aid. What it does as an action in the conversation is both

the giving of an account, and the complaining about a policy. The constituent is not engaged

in negotiating the responsibilities of the MP, but in getting help for herself and her partner.

The political nature of the account makes it all the more relevant for the MP to provide aid –

the MP’s government was the source of the some of the difficulty, and so it is appropriate

that the MP likewise fixes the problem.

The MP treats the complaint as deserving a political account, which proves that

however subtle the comment may appear to analysts, the MP interprets it as politically

oriented. The MP, by treating it as a political statement, acknowledges the way that C2 has

politicized (by mentioning the negative impact of this action) the policy decision on pensions.

The MP responds to this politicization with a depoliticization – making the decision appear as

less of a decision or action, and more of a forced result. The MP accounts for the pension

moving as part of an effort to fill the ‘big black hole’ (Lines 18-19), which refers to the lack

of government finances and the UK deficit. He mentions that the change has been impacting

on ‘everybody’ (Line 19), which neutralizes the constituent’s particular claim to

complainability about the pension move (although note that the reference to ‘everybody’ is a

rhetorical device, Sacks, 1975). Lastly, he characterizes the change as part of ‘difficult

choices’ (Line 25) that the government has made. Although the MP includes himself in the

active effort of ‘we’re trying to sort out…the big black hole’ (Lines 18-19), he leaves an

agent out of ‘difficult choices’, letting it remain ambiguous as to who actually made the

131

difficult choices (and thus who actually has the blame of moving pensions). The ‘difficult’

component is key, as it highlights that while it was a choice, it was a forced, involuntary one.

The MP also makes efforts to be ‘on side’ with C2, empathizing with three repeats of ‘I

know::’ (Lines 11-13) and prefacing his account with ‘unfortunately’ (Line 13). At the end of

the extract, C2 herself moves the conversation back to the main issue of the appeals tribunal.

The conversation never returns to the issue of pensions or the government in the remainder of

the surgery.

Extract 5.5 is the prototypical example of a constituent-initiated political comment,

wherein the constituent shows efforts to mitigate the potential delicacy of the comment. The

comment is typically a criticism, and, by virtue of being part of the political party that created

the problem in question, the MP is implicated in the same criticism (Sacks 1992, p.795).

Criticizing another person to their face is a highly problematic action to do in conversations

(Edwards, 2005; Stokoe & Hepburn, 2005; Heinemann, 2009; Traverso, 2009). Constituents

may need to express their criticism, as it supports their case for needing the MP’s assistance,

but they need to manage the interactional difficulties as well. Furthermore, there may be even

more difficulty in expressing a politically-oriented criticism, as Ekström (2016) has found

that people may treat politics as delicate and an unsafe topic.

The same pattern repeats itself in Extract 5.6. In this extract (which involves the same

constituent as Extract 5.3, but earlier in the meeting), the constituent (C) has come to explain

the difficulties she has been having due to the recent changes in benefits policies. The extract

begins just as she is invited to begin (Line 1).

Extract 5.6: MP01.Surgery-1KZ3_04 (see also Extract 5.3) 1 MP: you carry on we’ll uhm, Ann’ll take notes. 2 C: Right.=Lovely.=Thanks. .hhhh Uh:m, It’s regarding the 3 uh:m::, hhh tch, benefits changes, 4 MP: Yeah. 5 C: <And how belittling> they’ve made me feel. 6 MP: °Oh I’m s[orry.] Yeah.° 7 C: [Uhm, ] e- They: haven’t taken into 8 accou:nt at all about my disability.=They’ve- .hhh 9 I’ve been made to fee:l, like I’m the only one. 10 (0.5) 11 C: .hhh Uhm They- th- fhhhfff e- the assessment was 12 absolutely awful. C’s case is unusual, as she has come partially to discuss an issue that is policy-relevant: the

benefits changes (she has also come to ask for aid and resources in a dispute with her ex partner, discussed after the benefits, in data not shown. This is important to note to underline

132

that she is still hoping to receive some aid from the MP during her visit). C’s opening line is

marked with disfluencies (Lines 2-3) such as ‘uh:m’ and ‘tch’: markers of delicacy about the

topic. This shows C is oriented to a potential delicacy in raising her concern, which is

consistent with the way politically-relevant topics have been treated so far. C also frames the

benefits changes as a mutually known (‘the…benefits changes’, Lines 2-3) but agentless

item, by refraining from mentioning how the benefits changes came about. The benefits

changes in and of themselves become the source of feeling belittled (Line 5) or ‘like I’m the

only one.’ (Line 9) – rather than the person or organization (the MP’s party) that caused the

benefits changes. C also frames the problems with the benefits changes through the first person perspective – ‘they’ve made me feel’ (Line 5) and ‘I’ve been made to fee:l’ (Line 9).

This framing highlights that the views are subjective. In contrast, when C assesses how the

disability assessment process occurred, she frames it as an objective issue (‘the assessment

was’, Line 11) (see Edwards & Potter, 2012). This may be because the assessment centre is

more distantly related to the MP – it is only the centre that is accountable for its actions,

rather than the MP. Finally, note that C uses an extreme case formulation to describe the

assessment centre (‘absolutely awful’, Line 12), whereas the descriptions of the benefits

changes themselves are more downgraded, in part because of the subject-side assessments

(‘like I’m the only one’ Line 9). Overall, C designs her turn to carefully manage who is

accountable for the problems she is describing. For the benefits changes, in which the MP is

more closely implicated, C uses more delicacy markers and does not assess the MP

personally. For the assessment centre, she directly assesses the centre with an extreme case

formulation. In this way, we can see how constituents manage statements that could

potentially be critical of the MP – a co-present interlocutor.

Although a constituent may attempt to raise a topic as political, the MP can efface the

relevance of the political aspect of the turn. The MP can choose to respond to possible

political comments without addressing their political nature. This does more than depoliticize

the issue – it treats the political nature as irrelevant. In Extract 5.7, the constituent (C) is

attempting to sponsor an immigrating family to the UK. But he missed the UK Border

Agency’s (UKBA – the UK immigration services) phone call to him, in which he was

supposed to provide sponsorship information. There is no way for an average citizen to

contact the UKBA and no helpline available, so the constituent has no way of communicating

with the UKBA to rectify the misunderstanding. If he cannot complete his role in the process,

the immigration application will fail. He has come to the MP to ask for them to contact the

UKBA for him.

133

Extract 5.7: MP01.Surgery-13KO_05 1 C: But again there was no email an’ no htelephone 2 number. 3 (0.3) 4 CW: No. As it happens that’s <where I call,> so, 5 C: Oh I s[ee. 6 CW: [Don’t worry about [that. 7 C: [>Brilliant,< But- 8 (0.3) °it’s (a) frustrating.° 9 MP: Mm. 10 C: There’s <got to be:,> at least, you know, All 11 er- All I woulda done was, (0.2) an’ hour or 12 two later, (0.2) °picked up the° pho:ne, (0.4) 13 an’ even if there was an <Answer phone.> 14 (0.6) 15 C: to say:, .hhh “This is such an’ such, you rang 16 me two hours ago, Please give me a ring:, with 17 reference to.” 18 CW: Yes. 19 MP: Ye[ah. 20 C: [(B- Uhm an’ that’s, (0.3) that’s #eh- 21 #=°yeahhh,=It’s° something that’s wor:th, (0.2) 22 perhaps making a point but (that is/at least) 23 there is some way, 24 (0.6) 25 C: [<of:> getting in-= 26 MP: [For you to get in touch= 27 C: =[<in ] hco[ntact.>] 28 MP: =[with them,] [Yeah. ] W- Yeah. 29 CW: Mm, 30 C: >You know i- w- It’s< an hE[mail. 31 MP: [>We can< explain it 32 an’ then when A[nn ca:lls, 33 CW: [Yes, 34 MP: Y- We’[ll explain what’s] happened, 35 CW: [Yes I’ll ex- ] 36 C1: Mm. On Lines 1-2, C is accounting for why he needed to contact the MP’s office for assistance,

rather than managing the issue himself. He is demonstrating his efforts at self-help (Edwards

& Stokoe, 2007). This is the third separate time he has mentioned that there was no way to

contact the UKBA, meaning that this is once again an environment that is simultaneously

accounting for the desperation of a constituent’s situation, as well as pursuing a complaint.

The caseworker (CW) does not take up the possible-complaint her response on Line 4 – but

instead reassures C that she will call precisely at the UKBA office he has tried to contact. C

accepts this reassurance, but again remounts his complaint on Lines 7-8 – ‘But- (0.3) °it’s (a)

frustrating.°’ In continuing to explain his complaint, C starts with an insistence that ‘There’s

<got to be:,>’ (Line 10), before self-repairing, and moving away from that trajectory of

134

sequence. Instead, C repairs to a more neutral, less insistent proposal, in which he minimizes

the effort it would take to make the UKBA contactable (Lines 10-17).

The MP and CW still do not do more than a minimal acceptance of C’s complaint –

instead of the more relevant affiliation and demonstration of an independently agreed stance.

As a result, C does one more pursuit of the complaint, this time making the political

potentially relevant. C says, ‘It’s° something that’s wor:th, (0.2) perhaps making a point’

(Lines 21-22), suggesting that it may be worth making a bigger point about the contactability

of the UKBA. C does not specify who should make the point – whether it is himself to the

MP, or the MP or CW to the UKBA – but does broaden the impact of his issue. As seen in

Extracts 5.1-5.3, this can make the political relevant. C can be seen to be politicizing the

choice of the government and/or UKBA to keep the public from contacting the organization,

by suggesting it is better to allow contact.

However, the MP does not respond politically. Following a series of collaborative

completions, which help to show the MP is aligned with C, the MP says they will explain the

issue to the UKBA (Lines 31-34). This implies that C’s central concern was expressing his

own worries about being unable to contact the UKBA, rather than wider worries about the

very contactability of the UKBA as an organization. With this turn, the MP retroactively

ascribes C’s meaning to be about his personal concern, rather than a politically relevant wider

concern. In this way, the MP removes the relevance of a politically oriented answer, and

removes any need to make a statement about his own position, or the government’s position

on the matter – but without overtly refusing to answer (Ekström, 2009).

Extract 5.7 shows how it is necessary for both parties to collaborate in the creation of a

sequence as political. It cannot be achieved by one person alone (the organization of the

chapter as MP- or constituent-initiated is for convenience – in both sections it can be seen

that the interlocutor needs to accept the political aspect and collaborate in its role in the

sequence). This further shows how ‘the political’ is the product of interactional work by

conversation participants, not by extrinsic or analyst’s labels. Individual participants can

initiate the possible relevance of the political, but both parties must engage in political

implications in order to continue a sequence of turns that discuss political topics.

In this section, we have seen that constituents raise politically relevant comments by

highlighting the potential choice involved in making a policy – often through criticism – in

other words, by politicizing certain actions taken by government. When criticizing these

actions, the constituents are indirect, showing markers of delicacy. In contrast to news

interviews, constituents do not ask accountability questions, nor do they pursue the political

135

aspect of their complaint. Given the indirectness of constituents’ turns, it is also possible for

the MP to ignore or not take up the (potential) political aspects of a constituent’s complaint.

In the next and final section, I will show a deviant case, in which the constituent explicitly

compliments the MP’s political party leader, and how that compliment is managed differently

than the criticisms above.

5.4 Complimenting instead of criticizing

All extracts until now have involved criticisms of the government and the party to which the

MP belongs (including critical implications of the complaints in Section 5.2). The final case,

Extract 5.8, involves constituents complimenting the MP and his party. Unlike the previous

extracts, the constituents here are explicit and specific in their comments, suggesting that the

action of complimenting raises different interactional contingencies than criticizing. The

constituents (C1 and C2, partners) are visiting the surgery for a series of concerns, most of

which are critical of local government and police. However, at one point, they begin to

discuss the available national parties and their thoughts on the previous election.

On Lines 1-3, 16, and 18-21 (latter not shown), C2 explicitly assesses other political party

leaders negatively. In contrast, C2 assesses the MP’s party leader positively (Lines 25-26).

The assessments are not mild or neutral – ‘°a grade Ay prat¿°’ (Line 2) is strongly negative,

and likewise ‘an °<absolute gem.>°’ (Line 26) is strongly positive. He twice uses honesty

phrases (Lines 3 and 25; Edwards & Fasulo, 2006), which both portray him as sharing a

thought that is usually held privately, and that is independently his own. He also appends ‘I

<really do,>’ (Line 5) and ‘That’s an opinion of- of my own,’ (Line 29), which respectively

underscore the strength of his stance, and the independently held nature of his stance. C2

accurately predicts that he needs to do work to show how genuine his assessments are; the

MP expresses surprise at his positive assessment, and although he certainly needs to get the

MP’s assistance with his troubles, it is socially inappropriate to compliment merely to receive

the MP’s aid. The MP, though, may be expressing surprise in order to mitigate the possible

interpretation of accepting a compliment for oneself; since he is associated with the positively

assessed leader, to immediately accept the compliment would be to also accept a compliment

for oneself. Usually, speakers self-deprecate and deny compliments (Pomerantz, 1984). It is

also possible that the MP may simply have expected further negative assessments after

several in a row.

Extract 5.8 shows how compliments can be dealt with much more directly than

criticisms. This is likely because compliments (despite often being denied by the recipient)

are preferred actions and more socially acceptable (Pomerantz, 1984). Criticizing a person

directly is unusual and requires very careful management (Edwards, 2005). Complimenting

requires different management – the demonstration of sincerity. Criticizing a mutually

disliked party can also be a source of affiliation and social solidarity (Clayman, 2002b; Clark,

Drew & Pinch, 2003; Edwards, 2005), although Extract 5.8 also shows the MP disavowing

any personal knowledge of or ability to assess the Labour leader (Line 13, possibly similar to

Drew & Walker, 2009). Extract 5.8, although showing different features, proves a rule – that

constituents are highly concerned with managing the interactional contingencies inherent in

speaking to the MP. These contingencies apply across complaints and situations, and across

the small sample of population characteristics. The central fact remains: dealing with

criticisms must be delicately managed due to the interactional issues related to social norms,

such as not criticizing a person directly.

137

5.5 Discussion

In this chapter, I have shown how Members of Parliament and their constituents raise

political topics in constituency office surgery interaction. Although the data come from a

small sample, consistent patterns were found across the data set. Political topics tend to arise

in complaint sequences. The political aspect of a topic is made relevant turn-by-turn,

reminiscent of the stepwise topic transition described by Jefferson (1984a). Both parties

(constituents, and constituency office staff) must participate in the building of the topic as

political – otherwise the topic remains only possibly politically implicative, and is not

formulated as political. When the political nature of the setting is invoked and made relevant

by the MP, it portrays the government as a proactive organization with the same interests and

values as the constituent. When constituents make politics relevant, it is often to criticize the

government. However, making a criticism directly to a member of the criticized organization

is interactionally difficult, and constituents design their turns carefully to manage the delicacy

of the situation. When constituents are complimenting the MP or the MP’s party or

government, they are more explicit.

I have proposed that constituents privilege the interactional and relational nature of the

meeting over any potential grievances or possible political agendas. Constituents’ concerns

must take a back seat to the interactional contingencies of speaking to the MP. This supports

prior research that has found that people pay attention to the setting in which they raise

political topics, and to whom they speak (Ekström, 2016, Schmitt-Beck & Lup, 2013). People

also treat politics as a potentially delicate topic (Ekström, 2016, p.17), and are careful to

manage how they express disagreement (Schmitt-Beck & Lup, 2013, p.529).

My findings also support research that has found that interactional contingencies are

always of critical importance to analyzing talk (Schegloff, 1997b) – the observations made

could only have been discovered through an understanding and analysis of interaction. This

calls into question much of the research based on self-report surveys, given that these surveys

can provide no insight into interactional practices that may influence how and when we do

political talk – as Eveland et al. (2011, p.1086) put it, “the empirical literature is built on

shaky ground.” As demonstrated in Extracts 5.8, sequential position alone may change what

opinions are expressed, suggesting it is unwise to treat political attitudes or values as stable

across settings and time (as in Dalton, 2000).

The findings in this chapter differ from past findings concerning complaints to

institutions (Ekström & Lundström, 2014; Orthaber & Marquez-Reiter, 2011), wherein the

complaints were about the institution being called, rather than a third party. In these studies,

138

the call takers were implicated in the complaint by being members of the complained-about

company, and the callers complained directly to them. This contrasts with the delicate way in

which constituents managed a similar situation with the MP and the MP’s party. Possibly

because of the indirect formulations of the constituents’ complaints, the MP also affiliated

and/or aligned with the constituents, unlike in the studies above. The cause of this difference

is uncertain. First, it may be due to constituents seeking help from the MP, but this is

unlikely, as callers also needed service in the Ekström and Lundström (2014) study. Second,

it may be due to talking to a politician in person, although this also seems unlikely, given

how adversarial citizens act in citizen participation shows (Ekström & Eriksson, 2013;

Ekström & Moberg, 2015; Hutchby, 2006). Finally, it may be due to the face-to-face nature

of the constituency office encounters, or the personal nature (the MP’s personal details, and

the constituents, were known and available to both parties from the outset, including name

and residence area) of the encounters.

Political topics were used to achieve certain ends in conversation. Constituents used

political topics to underline their need of assistance, and to enhance their complaint. The MP

used political topics to show the government as aligned with constituent interests, but also

regularly achieved a closure of complaint sequences. Showing the government is already

acting on an issue has a certain ‘unanswerable’ quality – there is no further need to complain,

because the issue is being dealt with, but there is no way to evaluate yet how well the

complaint is being managed (see Ekström et al., 2015, for similar practices in news

interviews). Furthermore, referencing the government allows the MP to show himself as

aligned with constituents without necessarily affiliating with their stance towards an issue

(Stivers, 2008). For instance, he does not agree that benefits changes have been bad (Extract

5.6), or that care homes are poorly run (Extract 5.1) – but instead makes relevant the action

being done by government to improve the situation. This is a useful way to defer or reduce

the relevance of affiliation, although it can be seen as evasive.

Many of MP’s comments presented in this paper could be evaluated as ‘evasive’ (see

Bull, Elliott, Palmer, Walker, 1996; Bull, 2008). But while many researchers have

investigated how politicians are evasive or ‘slippery’ (Bull, 2008; Hamilton & Mineo, 1998;

Bavelas, Black, Chovil & Mullett, 1990), no one has ever investigated whether and how

constituents themselves are evasive when talking about politics. While politicians and

political media interviewers have license in debates and broadcasts to be aggressive about

their points, average citizens and MPs at a constituency office are engaged in a comparatively

everyday style interaction, and do not have license to act in such an adversarial way. In this

139

paper, most of the talk reported portrays the MP as being relatively direct (with explicit

references to government action) and the constituents as relatively indirect (or evasive) when

raising political issues. This demonstrates why it is so crucial to investigate politics in its

everyday setting, and why detailed examination of actual interactions is necessary for

understanding what people actually do when discussing politics with their MP. We cannot

rely on how MPs act in Parliament or media to see how they act when engaging constituents

directly.

The asymmetry of an MP’s relative ease and a constituent’s relative delicacy raises a

question: are MPs in a privileged position in surgery settings? Constituents face difficulty in

raising criticisms that implicate the MP, while the MP has rights to knowledge about

government activities, allowing them to provide and claim a more informed status (for

example, in the face of policy criticism, they have greater rights to explain and/or deny

certain ‘facts’ about the policy). It is tempting to conclude that MPs, as a result of the

interactional contingencies, have an advantage or ‘power’ over constituents. Political analysis

is regularly concerned with the distribution of power, and with understanding goals and

motivations - things that conversation analysis usually avoids (Sidnell, 2010; but see Hepburn

& Potter, 2011a; Nishizaka, 1992). One problem with attributing power is that constituents

may have as much power over MPs as MPs do over constituents. MPs are potentially using

the surgery as a way to secure a vote (through the personal vote, see Chapter 1; Butler &

Collins, 2001; Cain, Ferejohn & Fiorina, 1987; Norris, 1997), but constituents did not

leverage this over the MP in the data above, through bargaining or threatening. It is key to

avoid attributing power a priori, as an attribute of certain roles. The MP and constituents had

differently distributed actions available to them, as is common in institutional encounters.

The MP has access to inside government knowledge, and can offer help; constituents have

the ability to complain or build a case for aid, but not to offer assistance, or to easily critique

government actions. Neither the MP nor constituents are powerless to act – they can still do

actions that are more typically done by other participants, but these actions require additional

interactional work, such as accounting. As a result, no ‘power’ or ‘privilege’ to do certain

actions is absolute, only relative and accountable.

Most importantly, this chapter demonstrates a necessary corollary to any interest in

‘power’ in everyday talk; if ‘power’ is supposed to influence how people talk, to what extent

does the status of ‘fellow interlocutor’ influence how people talk? How does this affect

constituents’ ability to criticize and interact with their government? How does this impact our

understanding of what voter engagement (specifically via voter discussions of politics) might

140

look like? Future work with more constituency offices and more politician-to-constituent

interactions may help answer these questions, and shape how we conceive of the ‘political’

discussion between represented and representative.

This chapter has given a partial, setting-specific response to Eveland et al.’s (2011,

p.1097) call for studies that put “an emphasis on understanding how and why individuals

engage in political conversations, what they actually convey during these conversations….”

Eveland et al.’s study was of mundane, ordinary conversations, however, and the data in this

thesis are not directly comparable in any way. I answer, although only for the constituency

office, that the MP initiated political topics to demonstrate how he and his political party

were aligned with constituents’ interests and proactively helping them in Parliament.

Constituents appeared to initiate political topics to pursue and provide supporting evidence

for their complaints. I suggest that Eveland et al.’s call could be modified to encourage

researchers to examine what political topics or sequences achieve in conversation, locally. As

seen in Extract 5.7, not all potentially political topics are ultimately achieved as political, and

there is interactional work required in making a sequence political, even in a setting where a

politician is present, and a connection to the traditionally political realm of ‘government’ is

available. In order to compare to Eveland et al.’s (2011) inquiry, this question must also be

examined in a non-institutional environment (Ekström, 2016). In mundane contexts,

participants may act more certainly as ‘equals’ (Schmitt-Beck & Lup, 2013), with equal

rights to conversational actions and relatively equal rights to claim access to information,

unlike at the constituency office, where the MP may be said to have greater rights and greater

access to government-related information. However, this chapter does provide insight into a

setting where the political talk is spontaneous and naturalistic, in an environment that is not

typically considered ‘political’, and where participants do not typically attend for the sole or

main purpose of engaging in political work.

Overall, examining political work done at constituency offices is challenging due to the

rarity of political topics that occur (although this finding may also hold true across a larger

data set in the future). But it is necessary, in order to see the relationship that MPs create with

their constituents, and vice versa, and to get access to the more nuanced, balanced, and

realistic views that constituents hold about their government and MPs. If the goal of modern

democracies is to re-engage the citizen, the best place to start is where citizens have the most

access to government officials and government policy: the constituency office.

In the next and final analytic chapter, I will analyze how relationship building with the

MP may work, and how MPs might build a ‘personal vote’, via the concept of ‘rapport’.

141

Chapter 6:

Rapport in interaction: Practices, outcomes, and client stake in rapport

6.0 Introduction

In the last chapter, I analyzed instances of political talk in interactions at the constituency

office. The presence of a Member of Parliament (MP) in the data and the MP’s political

associations spurred the investigation in the previous chapter. Similarly, this chapter was

prompted by the pervasive concern of how (and whether) MPs can earn ‘personal votes’ at

the constituency office (see Section 1.2.1). One way to get a ‘personal vote’ is to establish

‘rapport’: a connection or relationship with constituents that would promote a sense of trust

in the MP (and thus incline citizens to give that MP their vote). In this chapter, I will

investigate the concept of ‘rapport’, and whether ‘rapport-building’ activities are useful tools

for the MP in building relationships with constituents. I will demonstrate that ‘rapport’ has

been poorly conceptualized in the past, and that it is not available as a resource in interaction

for participants. Rapport studies have also overlooked the stake that clients have in rapport, a

detail that is particularly salient in interactions at the constituency office, where constituents

are asking for the MP for special assistance. Clients are not merely stoic and passive

recipients in interactions; they have a stake in building rapport for their own purposes. This

stake makes it even more challenging for rapport researchers to determine what (or whose)

rapport may be ‘being built’ at any given time, as well as whether the effects of rapport building strategies are due to rapport itself or to the client stake in a positive interaction.

In Section 6.1, I will discuss how the term ‘rapport’ is used, chiefly as way to describe

feelings of trust or connection in institutional relationships that promote more effective

encounters: in other words, as a means to an end. I will distinguish between three aspects of

rapport studies that previously have been inconsistently applied: studying rapport as a feeling,

rapport via the set of practices or behaviours people use, and studying the outcomes that may

be linked to rapport (such as a ‘personal vote’). In Section 6.2, I will examine two commonly

proposed rapport-building activities in interaction, pointing out that the presence of ‘rapport’

is not available to participants, but the practices and their local outcomes are available. Next,

in Section 6.3, I will investigate how constituents demonstrate their own concerns with

‘rapport’, and how they use practices that have traditionally only been analyzed as arising

from institutional practitioners, rather than clients. Finally, in Section 6.4, I will discuss these

findings, concluding that ‘rapport’ may be a misleading concept. If we wish to find practices

142

that improve the effectiveness of communication, we first need to include an interactional

perspective, but more importantly, we then need to see how practices (which are available to

and co-constructed by all participants) are linked to the ends (or outcomes) we seek.

6.1 Defining rapport

To begin defining rapport, it is useful to see an example of how the term rapport is used by

laypeople. In the following extract, one of the advisors for United States President Barack

Obama is discussing the difficulties the President had in passing a healthcare reform bill. In

the process of convincing politicians to vote for the bill, a block of politicians refused to sign

the bill unless anti-abortion legislation was added to it. The President’s team was looking for

supporters in the Catholic Church to help convince the politicians that such a step was not

necessary.

Extract 6.1: Wallis/BBC - Obamacare, 40:31-41:07 minutes Simplified verbatim transcript Na (narrator), CK (Carol Keehan), ND (Nancy-Ann Deparle, Director of Health Reform) (background material and staging in italics) 1 Na: The Whitehouse turned to a powerful ally within the Catholic 2 Church to help them remove abortion from the healthcare debate. 3 [visual of CK speaking at an event] 4 CK: N- uh Madam Secretary, ((addressing podium)) 5 Na: Sister Carol Keehan was CEO of the Catholic Health Association, 6 the largest nonprofit provider of healthcare in the US. 7 [visual of interview with ND] 8 ND: She and I talked quite a bit about it and I suggested that the 9 President call her and he did. And uh she was convinced- They- 10 they had a good rapport and trust, and she was convinced that 11 uh President Obama had no intention of covering abortion. Here, Nancy-Anne Deparle, an advisor to the President, explains how she connected the

President with Carol Keehan, a Catholic nun who eventually helped promote the bill. Deparle

uses the word ‘rapport’ (Line 10) to describe the relationship between the President and

Keehan, and moreover that this ‘rapport and trust’ was why Keehan was convinced to support

the President’s bill. The information about rapport was important enough to Deparle that she

suspended her narrative at Line 9 to do a self-repair, temporarily abandoning the story of how

Keehan was convinced. Once the comment about the President and Keehan’s rapport and

trust is inserted, Deparle returns to the narrative of Keehan being convinced (Line 10-11).

Rapport was an important part of explaining how the President got the assistance he wanted

from Keehan. This is an excellent example of how we treat the concept of rapport – as a

143

means to an end. While some rapport research may be motivated to study rapport in and of

itself, many studies, especially those of institutions such as medicine or sales, look at rapport

as a means to accomplishing more effective service, or increasing customer satisfaction

(Beach, Keruly & Moore, 2006; Fogarty, Curbow, Wingard, McDonnell & Somerfield, 1999;

Hojat et al., 2011; Holmberg & Madsen, 2014).

Researchers and institutional practitioners have been investigating how to define and

how to ‘build’ rapport for decades (Egbert, Battit, Welch & Bartlett, 1964; Garbarski,

Schaeffer & Dykema, frth.; Harrigan, Oxman & Rosenthal, 1989). Rapport has been defined

and redefined countless times (Marcus, 2001; Spencer-Oatey, 2005), and it has been studied

in a wide variety of disciplines, from psychology and nursing to services and sales (Clark,

Drew & Pinch, 2003; Macintosh, 2009; Thompson & McCabe, 2012; Travelbee, 1963). Most

of these studies have been motivated to study rapport so that practitioners of all kinds can be

better equipped to use rapport as an interpersonal tool when practicing their trades. Rapport

has long been considered to be an important way to create client satisfaction and more

effective service relationships (Fogarty et al., 1999; Gremler & Gwinner, 2008).

Rapport is usually only used to describe institutional relationships, not friendships or

family relationships. Rapport, after all, is typically an institutional concern (Drew &

Heritage, 1992), because it is built in order to achieve an institutional goal, such as

therapeutic alliance with a patient (Thompson & McCabe, 2012) or better evidence in police

investigations (Alison, Alison, Noone, Elntib & Christiansen, 2013; Fogarty, Augoustinos &

Kettler, 2013; Vallano & Compo, 2011). Studies of relationships and friendship focus on

other concepts such as ‘connection’, ‘trust’, or ‘friendliness’, rather than on rapport. For

example, this extract is from a speed date between a man and a woman who have just met for

the first time.

Extract 6.2: SD-2 (from Stokoe, personal communication) 1 M: And you seem like you’ve got a nice personality as 2 well. But I think, speed dating, I’ve learned 3 that the main thing is you have to have that 4 connection, when you sit down with someone, like 5 you’re very easy to talk to which is good because 6 I- I when you sit down with someone you’ve got to 7 be able to connect with them Here, the participant is describing how necessary it is to have that ‘connection’ with

someone, especially when speed dating, where one only has a few minutes to evaluate a

person and decide if you will continue a relationship with them. Although ‘rapport’ could

144

have been used here, it would suggest a more ends-oriented relationship, which may not be

ideal in a scenario where one is attempting to start a relationship based on genuine

interpersonal interest. Also, beyond service encounters, when researchers build rapport, such

as in interviews (Abell, Locke, Condor & Gibson, 2006; Bedi, Davis & Williams, 2005), or

ethnography (Berger, 2001; see Marcus, 2001 for counterpoint), there are ethical questions

surrounding the ‘fake’ friendship of rapport-with-informants and interviewees (e.g.,

Duncombe & Jessop, 2002). When people do or build ‘rapport’, rather than ‘connection’ or

‘trust’, there is a purpose to it.

Many studies classify rapport as either present or absent (e.g., Beach et al., 2006;

Fogarty et al., 1999; Harrigan et al., 1989), which neglects the complex processes required to

create and maintain rapport. It is unfortunately common for studies in rapport literature to

define neutrality with interactional features and practices that are actually hostile, rude, or

anti-social (this also begs the question of whether there can be ‘unrapport’ or negative

rapport, as well as absent rapport). For instance, no-rapport conditions in experiment-based

studies included dropping items on tables abruptly (Collins, Lincoln & Frank, 2002), acting

stern (Almerigogna, Ost, Bull & Akehurst, 2007), sitting “in intimidating silence” (Davis &

Bottoms, 2002, p.193), face threats (Campbell, Davis & Skinner, 2006), and interruption

(Walsh & Bull, 2012). These studies are uninformed about what constitutes an acceptable

interactional minimum of politeness or sociability (see Clayman, 2002b; Davidson, 1984;

Georgakopoulou, 2001; Potter & Hepburn, 2010b; Stokoe, 2013a). In the ‘low rapport’ or ‘no

rapport’ test conditions, participants or experimenters display behaviours that most people

would never display even to a stranger. While experiment-based studies may see this as

necessary to create a significant enough difference between conditions, it means that they

have no ecological validity.

Another problem in rapport studies is that different studies have different directions of

causation. Some studies, for instance, claim that rapport builds trust (e.g., Campbell et al.,

2006), while others say that trust is part of building rapport (e.g., Norfolk, Birdi & Walsh,

2007). Furthermore, many studies rely on self-report as a means to testing the presence of

rapport. For example, survey and interview studies regularly ask either practitioners (Joe,

Simpson, Dansereau & Rowan-Szal, 2001; Vallano, Evans, Compo & Kieckhaefer, 2015) or

clients (Beach et al., 2006; Fogarty et al., 1999; Gremler & Gwinner, 2000) to report on what

techniques successfully built rapport in past encounters. We now know a lot about what

people report to have created rapport, but very little about what may have actually created

rapport (Alison et al., 2013; Fogarty et al., 2013). There are no studies that examine whether

145

participants can recognize rapport as it happens in the moment-by-moment unfolding of

interaction.

In summary, rapport is of longstanding interest to institutional practitioners, and is

treated as a means to achieving (or more easily achieving) an outcome, such as client

satisfaction or improved evidence. Studies of rapport could be improved if they were

informed about the complexities of interaction, such as the appropriateness of certain

practices in context. Furthermore, these studies never address whether the rapport was

recognized by participants in situ during the interaction, rather than assigned ex post facto. In

the next section, I will use a more interactional approach to distinguish between the practices

that people may use to build rapport, and the outcomes related to rapport.

6.1.1 Rapport, practices, and outcomes

There are three aspects of studying rapport: 1) studying the subjective, self-reported feeling

or state of rapport in a situation or relationship (‘rapport itself’), 2) studying the practices or

behaviours that people use to create, build, or maintain rapport (‘practices’), and 3) studying

the outcomes of rapport-as-a-state or of rapport-building practices, such as increased client

satisfaction (‘outcomes’). In this section I will argue for studying interactionally situated

practices and the relationship of practices to various outcomes.

Practices can include demonstrating empathy, appropriate laughter, using first names

(Bedi et al., 2005; Norfolk et al., 2007), or something more complex like making easy-to affiliate-with assessments (Clark et al., 2003). It is common in studies of rapport to equate

rapport with certain practices, test for the presence of these practices, and then take that

presence to mean that there is rapport. However, these studies only test for the individual

practices, rather than for rapport itself (e.g., Ädel, 2011; Alison et al., 2013; Harrigan et al.,

1989; Joe et al., 2001; Krupnick et al., 1996; Lipovsky, 2012; Macintosh, 2009; Simmons Mackie & Damico, 2011). This means the studies suggest a relationship between rapport

itself and the desired outcomes, rather than between the practices and the outcome. The role

of the practices is neglected.

The above rapport studies also do not address or appreciate the interactional context in

which the practices are situated. However, even in studies that do appreciate interactional

norms, rapport is often equated with practices. Past conversation analytic (CA) studies have

equated rapport with specific, and limited, practices. Lavin and Maynard (2001) investigated

how laughter can be taken as a sign of building rapport in the face of trouble in phone

surveys. Clark et al. (2003) investigated how sales representatives built rapport with their

146

‘prospects’, or potential buyers, by engaging prospects in lengthy affiliative sequences of

talk. The sales representatives did interactional work to extend the affiliative sequences, and

to ensure more aligning responses. Fogarty et al. (2013) equated rapport with progressivity,

the tendency for conversational sequences to structurally favour responses that move the

sequence forward. A smooth sequence, in which progressivity is high, may be a characteristic

of conversations that we as analysts tend to judge as being high in rapport as well, since

things such as coordination (Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal, 1990), ‘dialogue’ (Collins et al.,

2002) and responsiveness (Garbarski et al., frth.) are all present as well. As Fogarty et al.

(2013, p.399) put it, “We are making the more modest claim that progressivity is likely to be

present in interactions that are judged as containing signs of rapport…” These three CA

studies succeed at analyzing practices, with an understanding of interactional norms, but the

results are limited to addressing one potential practice at a time. The very fact that each study

chose a different practice suggests that rapport cannot be contained in one practice, and

instead may result from or be seen in a variety of practices. These studies also overlook the

client stake in rapport (see Section 6.3). While these studies examine interactionally

appropriate practices, with an understanding of how sequence and turn design affect results,

we still need to investigate whether the practices studied generate participant-recognized

rapport during the interaction.

We can examine participant recognition of rapport through an analysis of ‘local’

outcomes. Most studies of rapport examine long-term ‘distal’ outcomes, such as client

satisfaction, increased sales, or voting for an MP. The presence of rapport is necessarily

assessed ex post facto, either by analysts or by participants in surveys or interviews.

However, it is possible to analyze ‘local’ outcomes: the unfolding of alignment, affiliation

(Clark et al., 2003), progressivity (Fogarty et al., 2013), resistance or acceptance of services

(see Chapters 3 and 4), and so forth. ‘Local’ outcomes are observable to both participants and

analysts, and unfold in the interaction itself. They do not necessarily suggest that rapport

itself (as a feeling, or assessed quality) is present, but the local outcomes themselves are

useful for the institution. For example, Fogarty et al. (2013) report that police officers employ

practices to promote progressivity when interviewing child witnesses. This reduces the

chance that the child will fail to answer the question at all, or answer only partially. The local

outcome is higher responsiveness from the witness, as well as avoiding non-response, which

is beneficial to the police investigation.

In this section, I have outlined further distinctions in the question of what ‘rapport’ may

look like in interaction. Namely, I have distinguished between rapport itself, which is a

147

feeling or subjective state, practices, which are the interactional tools that can end up creating

rapport or an outcome, and outcomes, which are the results of interactional practices.

Outcomes can be further divided into ‘distal’ outcomes, which are assigned ex post facto by

analysts or participants, and ‘local’ outcomes, which are the interactional effects, as seen in

subsequent turns.

In the next section, I will analyze two commonly proposed practices for generating

rapport in institutional encounters. The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate that while

‘rapport’ itself may be unavailable in situ, the practices and local outcomes are available to

participants.

6.2 Finding rapport in interactions

In this section I will look at two commonly suggested practices (Gremler & Gwinner, 2008;

Walsh & Bull, 2012) that are meant to build rapport – displaying common ground, and using

small talk. In each extract, I will demonstrate the practice being used, and examine its local

outcomes. We will see that while there are clearly visible local outcomes, they do not

necessarily show that rapport has been or is being created, neither for us as analysts nor for

the participants in the interaction. This suggests that rapport as a subjective feeling is not

available to CA methods, nor to participants, and that it is therefore unnecessary for the

analysis of local outcomes.

6.2.1 Displaying common ground

One common recommendation in rapport literature is finding ‘common ground’ (Gremler &

Gwinner, 2008; Macintosh, 2009). In rapport studies, ‘common ground’ refers to a colloquial

definition, which involves displaying shared features or similarities between practitioner and

client (rather than maintaining or displaying intersubjective common ground, Sidnell, 2010,

2014). One practice that can achieve ‘common ground’, in CA terms, is co-membership

categorization (Benwell & Stokoe, 2006; Sacks, 1992; Stokoe, 2009). The extract below

shows the MP aligning with the constituents by referencing their joint ‘Britishness’. The

constituents (C1 and C2) are there because their benefits have been cancelled, as C1 has been

incorrectly assessed as fit for work. They have been discussing the assessment questionnaire

that they took, in which they were asked if C1 could do things like make a cup of tea or do

the washing up.

148

Extract 6.3: MP01.Surgery-1KO_01 1 C1: [I can do the washing] hup. 2 C2: [U h : m : ] Yeah. 3 C1: You know:, 4 MP: >I know the Trouble is of course we’re all very< 5 British when we [do ] these, 6 C1: [Yes.] 7 MP: An’ actually the- the answer, 8 C2: Mm[::, ] 9 MP: [The-]th-th- the answer probably is no. 10 (0.4) 11 MP: Uh:, 12 C1: [WELL:, yeah. ] 13 MP: [So when they ask] you, can you do these the answer’s [no. 14 C1: [Heh 15 heh [heh hih .hh 16 MP: [Actually I can’t. [An’ we’re all] very good at 17 C2: [Yeah, ] 18 MP: trying to s- be: as confident an’ capable as we= 19 C2: =[That’s ri:ght, 20 MP: =[can be, 21 C2: Yeah.     On Line 1, C1 insists that he can ‘do the washing up’. The MP responds with an agreement,

‘I know’ (Line 4), and then categorizes C1, C2 and himself as ‘all very British’. This is

referencing the idea that British people have a ‘stiff upper lip’, and will present themselves as

capable people even in the face of illness. The MP later continues the co-membership

categorization (of ‘we’) as people who are ‘very good at trying to s- be: as confident an’

capable as we can be,’ (Lines 16-20). The MP categorizes all of them together, as British, and

as British people who try hard to be capable even when facing trouble. This is a very positive

kind of category, and as such it both pays a compliment to C1 and C2, as well as displaying

empathy towards the way they answered the assessment questionnaire.

The MP’s suggestion that it is due to being ‘very< British’ and ‘as confident an’

capable as we=can be,’ also avoids another potential implication from the constituent’s

complaint – that the MP is accountable for the problems brought on by the Workplace

Capability Assessments (WCAs). WCAs were implemented to reduce benefit fraud by testing

citizens’ level of disability and have been heavily criticized by the public and by experts

(Litchfield, 2014). The MP belongs to the political party that implemented the WCAs, and it

is due to the WCAs that the constituents are now facing financial difficulties. By blaming

C1’s responses on the ‘stiff upper lip’ idea, the MP pushes aside his own accountability for

his role in implementing the WCAs. The MP’s turn simultaneously accomplishes a

compliment to C1, for showing a ‘stiff upper lip’ attitude, while averting the implication that

the WCAs are inherently flawed.

149

C2 aligns with the MP’s suggestion, with ‘Yeah’ (Line 17 and 21) and ‘That’s ri:ght’

(Line19). C2’s responses progress the interaction forward, and position the participants as

aligned and in agreement. ‘That’s ri:ght’ (Line 19) especially demonstrates this outcome, as it

portrays C2 as fully committed and agreeing (Pomerantz, 1984), more so than mere

continuers like ‘mhm’ (Goodwin, 1986). On C2’s part, the MP’s practice of displaying

common ground appears to create a positive local outcome, of commitment and alignment.

C1 does not display the same alignment, although there may be other contingencies at play.

On Line 12, C1 says ‘WELL:,’, which forecasts a disagreeing turn (Heritage, 2015),

suggesting that he is about to resist the MP’s suggestion that he should answer ‘no’ to these

kinds of work capability questions. C1 also laughs in Lines 14-15, suggesting that he is either

displaying troubles resistance (Jefferson, 1984b) or managing the potential inappositeness of

portraying himself as incapable for work (Potter & Hepburn, 2010b) or both.

Rapport is not empirically explicit in this extract, which is precisely the point I wish to

show. The constituents make no utterances that might express their feelings of connection,

trust, harmoniousness, or rapport. However, the practice that the MP used – displaying

common ground by constructing joint membership in a category – is assumed in many

studies above to produce rapport, and in this extract the practice produced the local outcome

of an aligning sequence (see Clark et al., 2003, although the MP does not do ‘extended’

aligning sequences reported there). For the MP, who must navigate the sequence live, without

the benefit of questionnaires or explicit questions about rapport, C2’s alignment, and C1’s

lack of alignment, are readily available. The MP cannot ask about rapport, since any

divergence from the constituents’ concerns would make the MP appear disinterested or self serving. Instead, the MP can see the local outcomes of these sequences live, while still

focusing on the constituents’ concerns, and without any overt attempt to seek rapport.

Another assumption concerning ‘common ground’ is that it is the responsibility of the

institutional practitioner, the MP, to initiate and achieve its establishment. The first problem

with this assumption is that it is necessary for ‘common ground’, as with any interactional

practice, to be achieved as a coordinated sequence in interaction: the interlocutors must

collaborate in achieving the practice. The second problem is that other participants in the

interaction may also initiate the practice. Extract 6.4, below, demonstrates both of these

issues. In the extract, the constituent (C) is visiting the MP to give an update about a charity

she runs which focuses on exercise for the elderly. C has recently acquired a ‘Moves App’,

software for smart phones that tracks physical activity such as walking and reports on the

user’s health.

150

Extract 6.4: MP01.Surgery-1K3_01 1 C: .hh >I donno if you-< (0.7) if y- you’ve ever ah:- I 2 find, ih go- y’ got the [moo:] the mo:ves app. 3 MP: [Yes.] 4 (0.5) 5 MP: [mN o : , ] 6 CW: [Oh I’ve go]t that.= 7 MP: =Have yo[u, 8 C: [Is[n’t it hgreat.] 9 CW: [Yeah=Ye:ah it i]s good.=Yeah. 10 MP: Is that one that [COU:nts your: ste:p[s an::d,= 11 C: [( ) [hYeah. 12 CW: [Yeah 13 MP: =[Yeah:. 14 CW: [Yeah=yeah. 15 C: But it’s free- >I got the< free version. 16 CW: Yeah I have.

C

asks whether the MP has the Moves App. While this inquiry could have been initiated in

order to establish intersubjectivity concerning the software, what results from C’s utterance is

a sequence between the caseworker (CW) and C in which they express a shared enjoyment of

the software; in other words, they achieve a display of common ground. As the MP is saying

he does not have the Moves App (Line 5), CW says that he does (Line 6). C assesses the

software, and CW agrees, although with a downgraded assessment of ‘good’ instead of

‘hgreat’ (Lines 8 and 9). The MP shows that he has intersubjective understanding, that he

knows what the software is, by describing it (Line 10), but cannot assess or partake in the

expression of common ground. The MP appears to show that he feels it necessary to

151

participate in the sequence as much as possible, by showing that he knows what it is, and

repeating shortly thereafter that he has ‘heard about it’ (Line 26). C pursues the beneficial

aspects of the software (Lines 15, 27, 30, 32-34) until CW shares a lengthier personal story

that shows his appreciation for the software and its positive uses (Lines 35-37).

Again we see that rapport is not made explicit, as there are no utterances that express

feelings of trust or connection between participants. Also, C is the one who initiates the

common ground talk, not the institutional practitioners (CW or the MP). C and CW are the

ones who participate in the sharing of common ground, rather than the MP. This contradicts

previous understandings of using common ground to build ‘rapport’; the MP is the one who

is ‘supposed’ to initiate rapport practices, and is also the one that is ‘supposed’ be building a

personal vote. The common ground sequence ‘should’ be done by him and with him in order

to improve the ‘rapport’ with the practitioner in charge. Instead, any attempts by the MP to

participate are not sustained by the other participants. When first asking if it is the software

that counts steps, C and CW confirm this fact, before C returns to praising the software,

pointedly disjoining it from the prior talk, ‘But it’s free-’ (Lines 11-15). The MP’s second

attempt receives no response, and C overlaps the talk well before the end of the turn construction unit (Lines 26-27). In other words, the local outcomes for the MP are not

demonstrating any successful rapport-building, whereas the local outcomes for C and CW are

displaying shared positive experiences with the software.

The above extract suggests there is more to displaying common ground (and more to

the achieving of common ground) than has previously been assumed in most rapport studies.

The constituent, the client, initiated and pursued the common ground here, rather than the

practitioners. Furthermore, simply initiating the display of common ground will not

necessarily generate a positive local outcome, let alone a useful distal outcome. Next, I will

examine a different practice that supposedly builds ‘rapport’: the practice of ‘small talk’.

6.2.2 Small Talk

Another commonly recommended practice is engaging in ‘small talk’ with clients. It is rarely

made clear in communication training what a practitioner is to do once they have ‘finished’

with small talk. It is implied that once small talk is done, rapport has been established, and

the rapport task is over and done with, leading to the problematic ‘rapport stage’ concept

(Walsh & Bull, 2012; Fogarty et al., 2013). For present purposes, I will examine talk that is

tangential to and does not serve the institutional goal of the CO meetings: for example,

expressing condolences on a recently deceased family member, or discussing the weather

152

(see Coupland, 2014, for a full discussion). This happens especially at the beginning or end

of meetings, when the MP or constituent raises talk about topics that are not clearly related to

or serving the cause of the constituent’s visit to the office that day.

Extract 6.5 is a brief example of this kind of sequence. The two constituents (C1 and

C2) have just entered the meeting room of the CO, to find the MP waiting there for them (as

another meeting had just finished).

Extract 6.5: MP01.Surgery-1KZ3_03 1 MP: How’re you both. 2 (0.9) ((C1 and C2 taking off coats)) 3 C1: [Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh ] heh (.) 4 MP: [(>(Let’s meet/to be) here on a Friday evening<)] 5 C1: .hheh .hh [Ye:s. ] 6 MP: [Ahheh hheh] hah [hhhah hah hah hah heh= 7 C2: [Yeahh, 8 C1: It’s been a long: (0.3) we- (0.2) 9 C2: [(This week.) 10 MP: [Well we- (0.2) We just hsaid ithat actually, >>it has 11 been-<< just feel, (like ih-) >a very< long week,= 12 C2: hYeah:, 13 (1.9) 14 MP: So:. 15 (1.2) 16 C1: °Yhesss,°=     The ‘small talk’ occurs from Lines 1-12, in which the MP and constituents are engaging in

the first turns of their meeting. C1 and C2 are taking off their coats (C1 goes off camera

during Line 3, making it unclear why she is laughing). The MP raises the fact that it is a

Friday evening, thus the workweek is officially over and this meeting is likely not the most

fun activity to be doing on what is stereotypically a time for entertainment. C1 aligns with

this implication by adding that ‘it’s been a long:’ week, which is collaboratively finished by

C2 (Lines 7-8). The MP agrees, upgrading to a ‘>very< long week’ (Line 11). Note that the

MP prefaces his agreement with ‘we just hsaid ithat actually’ (Line 10). This preface

establishes the MP’s agreement as speaking on behalf of the whole office (‘we’), and as

coincidentally thinking along the same lines as the constituents. By portraying the agreement

as coincidentally the same line of thought as the constituents, the MP does more than

agreeing – he categorizes the constituents, himself, and his staff as part of the same group,

who all think alike (see Section 6.2.1 on displaying common ground, above). The MP and

constituents subsequently move the conversation to official business: the MP starts with ‘So:’

(Line 14, see Section 3.1), and C1 aligns with this move (Line 16).

153

Theoretically, the MP has now built rapport. The local outcome of the small talk was

ratification from the constituents, seen in their aligning turns that participate in the activity of

small talk (the ‘Yeah’s on Lines 5, 7, and 12, as well as the more significant uptake of

discussing the workweek). Again, we still lack any access to the distal outcomes (will the

constituents be satisfied, for instance), but at this point in time, we have the same information

as was available to the MP – that the practice of small talk was taken up by the constituents,

and thus seems to have been successful for local purposes.

The next extract also ‘breaks’ one of the ways small talk is expected to operate in

rapport studies (National Crime Faculty, 2000; Walsh & Bull, 2012). Small talk is expected

to happen before the encounter, but in Extract 6.6, it appears after the encounter. The

constituent (C) and the caseworker (CW) and MP had been discussing a problem with

parking lots. The MP had initiated the closing of the encounter, and C is collaborating in that

closure on Line 1.

Extract 6.6: MP01.Surgery-2BG_02 1 C: Thank you. ((standing up)) 2 MP: No: it’s my pleasure. ((CW stands)) 3 (0.3) 4 MP: An’ I’m so- >it was-< it was your mum °I’m guessing° who- 5 who died.= 6 C: =Yes it [was. 7 MP: [Yeah I’m [sorry about that,= 8 C: [>Yeah yeah< no:. 9 MP: =I’m sorry to [read about anyway. Yeah.] ((standing)) 10 C: [>No no no no< No ] No problem. 11 (0.7) 12 C: Yeah it’s very- >it’s uh-< It’s very sad [but] uh: [you know, 13 MP: [( )] [°Mm,° 14 (0.7) 15 C: [( )] 16 MP: [It sounds] like she had a- she had an amazing li- in 17 the [magistr- 18 C: [sh:e- 19 MP: I had the [( ) to be a ma[gistrate you know ( )] 20 C: [Yeah, [Oh: no no she’d-] m- 21 the- magistra:te_ and uh: very <stout supporter of> the 22 Conserva[tive party >for many years,=.hhh< 23 CW: [Mm:. ((MP gives thumbs up))

As C prepares to leave, the MP gives condolences for the death of C’s mother (Lines 4 7). C responds with an idiom-like phrase ‘It’s very sad but’ (Line 12), which aligns with the

condolences but does not progress the sequence further. The MP does not stop at giving

condolences, however; after the silence on Line 14, the MP pursues the discussion of C’s

mother, opening the topic of her life. However, C relates the topic of his mother to her

154

support of the MP’s party (Lines 21-22). C has now initiated an expression of common

ground (see Section 6.2.1), that C’s relative was a supporter of the MP’s governing party. As

with Extract 6.4, C is the one doing this initiation, rather than the MP. In terms of local

outcomes, the sequence is aligning, but there is no clear indication of rapport. The MP’s

expression of condolences is not one that indicates his trust in C, nor vice versa. C expresses

that his mother (not he himself) supported the MP’s party, but this is not the same as

expressing a feeling of rapport with the MP currently. Again, the practices generate

reasonably positive local outcomes, but do not conform with how rapport is presented in the

non-CA literature.

In this section I have analyzed two practices, displaying common ground and small

talk, and pointed out the difficulty in locating ‘rapport’ in these extracts. I have shown that

these two practices are not necessarily only initiated by the MP, but also by the constituents,

and that the practices may occur in unexpected parts of the sequence, such as at the close of

the encounter instead of at the beginning. These extracts support previous findings by

conversation analysts that affiliation (Clark et al., 2003) and progressivity (Fogarty et al.,

2013) are common in sequences that appear to have rapport-like qualities. Although these are

just two practices, they demonstrate how one can analyze potential rapport as a set of

practices and local outcomes, without resorting to using rapport-as-subjective-feeling as an

explanatory variable. Practices and local outcomes are the best rapport-related resources to

which participants have access in interaction. The local outcomes could be due to rapport

specifically, or to practices that build rapport, or solely to practices – the actual direction of

causation does not matter, so long as practices and local outcomes are available to

participants.

I have noted above that constituents are frequently the initiators of supposedly rapport building practices. The role of rapport for constituents or clients has never been analyzed, as

researchers have focused exclusively on the institutional practitioners, such as the MP. In the

next section, I will examine how constituents use practices that supposedly generate rapport,

and show that they have a stake in doing so.

6.3 Client stake in rapport

Rapport literature does not acknowledge an important aspect of the client-practitioner rapport

process: clients have as much stake in building rapport as do practitioners. Clients experience

rapport, and their experience is worth investigating (Bedi et al., 2005; Gremler & Gwinner,

2008), given that they must necessarily partake in building and accepting of rapport. As

155

Kerekes (2006, p.30) puts it, “The establishment of rapport depends, however, on both

interlocutors. It takes cooperation and, as such, is co-constructed.” It is important for rapport

research to recognize that clients have a vested interest in building rapport for their own

purposes, and not only in experiencing or helping to construct rapport for the purposes of the

institutional practitioner.

A doctor has a stake in rapport because it (supposedly) leads to better and more

effective interactions, which leads to better treatments. A salesperson has a stake in rapport

because it (supposedly) leads to better sales. But in these encounters, the client also has a

stake, a vested interest in having rapport with the practitioner. The patient wants to receive

the best possible treatment; the buyer wants the best price. As a rule, clients want the best

service, along with easy access to this service, and any perks or extras that the practitioner is

willing to perform for the client’s benefit. Clients are not passively accepting (or not) rapport

strategies, nor are they merely co-constructing rapport for the practitioner’s sake. Clients

have their own interests, and their own stake in rapport being successful.

Consider the next extract. In this phone call, the constituent (C) has previously met

(two weeks prior) with the MP and caseworker (CW) to discuss her husband’s benefits,

which were erroneously cancelled. CW promised to call C with news before ten working

days had passed. But now C has called the office, because CW failed to do so. CW has just

explained what had happened and is apologizing (for the second time) at Line 1.

Extract 6.7: MP01.Phone-1LB_06 1 CW: Uhm: So sorry I’ve not- (.) 2 C: [No tha- ] (.)fi:ne (as I) say we’ been ’aving the= 3 CW: [Not um::] 4 C: =problem with ’em all the- all the way along at 5 [least it’s bin]= 6 CW: [ih’ y:ea h :: ] 7 C: =about sixty two: weeks now so, .hhh= 8 CW: =so: (.) ih’yeah [well they- they’re just in]CREdibly 9 C: [ah hh:: hh hhhh hih] 10 CW: busy but I- I will: le- you need a date so I’ll um:: I’ll 11 um:: get them tuh .hh tuh find one for you and- and 12 hope>f’lly get th’m< (.) >to come back to you with a< (.) 13 proper answer 14 C: O:kay well that’s lovely     C excuses CW for his failure to act on her behalf (Line 2), saying ‘No that- fi:ne’, and adding

she has likewise experienced a long delay (Lines 2-8). This expresses understanding and

empathy for CW’s situation, as it mirrors her own. However, C’s turn design also includes a

‘jab’ element: she includes the length of time she has been waiting. Not only is it a very

156

precise amount of time (‘sixty two: weeks’), the inclusion of a tag ‘now’ highlights that the

time is ever-increasing. In other words, C formats her turn in a way that foregrounds a

traditional rapport-generating practice – displaying common ground – but simultaneously

implicitly criticizes CW.

Leaving aside that we cannot tell if C or CW are experiencing rapport, notice that it is

the client, C, who is offering a supposedly rapport-generating practice to CW, the

practitioner. This is the reverse of the expected scenario. We also see that the rapport-like

practice of displaying common ground promotes a sense of entitlement to service (Curl &

Drew, 2008), by demonstrating how long C has been waiting for aid. By looking at this

practice in situ, we can see that it accomplishes more than merely (potential) rapport, but also

an element of requesting. The local outcome of the practice is that on Line 10, CW

acknowledges C’s need for aid (‘you need a date’) and concludes with an offer of assistance

(Line 10-11, ‘I’ll um:: get them tuh .hh tuh find one for you’). C’s reason for calling, to

follow up with the office about her case, has now been accomplished and she has received a

new offer. In this extract, C has used a practice that has traditionally been considered to build

rapport in order to achieve a useful local outcome, the offer of assistance. It is not the MP

here, but a constituent who utilizes rapport building practices.

Similarly, in Extract 6.8, the constituent (C) has a complaint about how local council

government is dealing with businesses.

Extract 6.8: MP01.Surgery-2BG_02 1 C: An’ also >they’re taking into account< N:o consideration for 2 local business. 3 MP: Yeah:,= 4 C: =You know, .hhh we- You know. Y- you’re a Branxsome person 5 yourself, (0.5) We ’ave gone through the toughest 6 [five years ]= 7 MP: [Absolutely.] 8 C: =that Branxsome’s Ever gone through, On Lines 4-5, C categorizes the MP as a ‘Branxsome person’, the name of the town. By

virtue of being a person of that town (not just a person from there, but a person defined by

that town name), the MP is in the know about how hard the last few years (of the economic

crisis) have been for the town and its people. C’s utterance on Line 4, ‘You know.’ suggests a

contrast with an unspoken party by the way ‘You’ is emphasized. C puts himself into the

category of Branxsome people on Line 5, with ‘We ‘ave gone through’. C shifts footing to an

inclusive ‘we’, including both himself and the MP in the category of people who understand

157

the situation. All of this is said as part of C’s argument that the local council is not dealing

with local businesses appropriately. Again we see a constituent – a client – engaging in

rapport-building practices, and receiving positive local outcomes (the MP’s agreement on

Line 7, ‘Absolutely.’). Regardless of whether either participant can tell if there is a feeling of

rapport present, the local outcome is available for the constituent to use. Since C’s stake is in

getting aid from the MP about challenging the local council, any movement towards that aid

is positive for him. Whether or not C’s actions are undertaken in order to create rapport, the

practices progress the interaction towards a positive local outcome.

Constituents regularly apologize or account for their request, or for the time they are

taking from the MP, as seen in the following extracts.

Extract 6.9: MP01.Surgery-1KZ3_04 1 C: Ri:g[ht. (0.3) Hi:,] uhm,= ((speaks with soft voice)) 2 CW: [( )] ((passing paper)) 3 C: =Thanks for taking the °time by the wayh.° 4 MP: No:!

158

4 MP: [>I don’t think they’re insignificant at all.<] 5 C: =like that that- .hhhh

In Extract 6.9 and 6.10 the constituents orient towards the difficulty in taking up too much

time, since surgery appointments are meant to be limited to 15 minutes. In Extract 6.9, C

demonstrates her understanding that the MP is ‘very busy’ (Line 9), and in Extract 6.10, C

mentions she knows she’s ‘got limited time.’ (Line 2). Constituents display this orientation

publicly, which makes their self-policing available to the MP and caseworker. The local

outcomes of these accounts about time do not receive ‘go aheads’ or things such as ‘take all

the time you need’, likely because time is constrained beyond the MP’s control. However, the

constituents do get their concerns on record, and are able to portray themselves as ‘good’

constituents who are not selfishly claiming all the MP’s time and efforts.

In Extract 6.11, C acknowledges that he is making a big deal out of what might be

considered a small complaint (Lines 1-2, ‘I know it’s a nuisance’…). C accounts for his

pursuit of the complaint, despite the ‘nuisance’ aspect (Line 4, ‘Because to me it’s

important’). In Extract 6.12, C similarly acknowledges that her concerns may seem

‘insignificant’ to the MP (Line 1). These practices, of acknowledging and accounting for a

request being potentially inappropriate, typically receive a reassuring utterance from the MP.

In Extracts 6.11 and 6.12, the MP gives the constituents the preferred response to a self deprecating type of utterance – he contradicts the constituents, and reassures them that their

concerns are legitimate and important (Lines 5-6 and 2-4 respectively). As local outcomes,

this provides the constituents with the reassurance to continue making their request, and that

they will likely receive some sort of assistance. Similar to Extracts 6.7 and 6.8, the

constituents here put on record their concern for the MP’s time and efforts, and demonstrate

that they would not willingly saddle the MP with inappropriate concerns.

Constituents even make statements that appear to give the MP an ‘out’, or a way to

make it structurally easier for the MP to deny assistance. In the following extract, the

constituents (C1 and C2) are co-workers at a factory that will soon close. They have been

fighting the closure, and the MP has been attempting to help them do so. The company

nevertheless announced shortly before the meeting that the closure would go ahead. This

extract occurs just after the constituents have sat down, at the beginning of the meeting.

them now. This is, in some respects, a remarkable thing to say. The utterance allows for the

possibility of a next turn that refuses aid. Yet C1 and C2 have come to this meeting to seek

aid from the MP, and now C2 is saying that they nevertheless no longer ‘really think’ there’s

‘much-’ the MP ‘can do now:.’ (Lines 15-16). The suggestion is full of hedges, such as ‘we

don’t really think’ and ‘much-’, allowing for the MP to contradict C2 and say that there is

something that the he can do. The utterance reverses the preference of the MP’s response

(Pomerantz, 1984; Clayman, 2002b), allowing a negative response from the MP to be more

structurally aligned to C2’s turn. As the MP had begun to discuss the difficulties he has had

in preventing the factory closure on lines 1-3, C2 may be projecting the upcoming failure,

and her turn makes it structurally ‘easier’ for the MP to continue in that disappointing vein.

This is not to say that if C2 had not taken such a turn that the MP would have given

‘different’ news, but C2 could have taken the opportunity to lament the closure, express

disappointment, or push the MP for other possible avenues for preventing the closure. By

avoiding being pushy, and by allowing for the likelihood that the MP can no longer help, C2

demonstrates that she is prepared for disappointing news. This kind of bad-news anticipation

is common in other settings, such as medical offices (see Maynard, 2003). Furthermore, by

specifying that there is not much the MP ‘can’ do, C2 implies that it is beyond the MP’s

control, and subtly absolves the MP of needing to provide aid. All these turn design features

foreground alignment and affiliation over entitlement to aid, which suggests that C2 is

privileging the rapport-building, relational aspects of the interaction over other contingencies.

C2’s turn achieves other actions in the sequence as well. C2’s turn may be a bid to find

out whether there is ‘any- well- thing much’ the MP ‘can do now:.’, via the use of a fishing

device (Pomerantz, 1980). C2 may also be justifying her presence at the office in spite of the

160

factory’s announcement about the closure. C2 prefaces her utterance with ‘I mean’, which

Maynard (2013) has shown to appear regularly in complaint sequences as a means of

defending one’s position. Since the factory closure is now clearly definite, one potentially

relevant complaint is that the MP failed to prevent the closure, but to do such a complaint to

the MP directly would be very face threatening and unusual. The ‘I mean’ prefaced utterance

averts the sequence from a potential complaint about the MP to a fishing device and/or a

discussion of other options. Clark et al. (2003) also found that sales representatives pre empted potential implications that could have damaged outcomes.

In this section, I have shown how constituents regularly use practices that have been

traditionally considered to build rapport. These practices show an orientation towards the

relationship they have with the MP, and how that relationship may or may not affect the

MP’s decision to offer them aid. As such, these practices show an orientation towards

rapport, and the need for rapport to achieve an end. I suggest that the constituents oriented to

these matters because they had a stake in getting the best service possible (or indeed, getting

any service at all). The practices shown here are not necessary for successful interaction, as it

is possible to go through sequences with office staff without these practices, and still receive

service. However, future research needs to disentangle ‘rapport’ practices from interactional

contingencies.

6.4 Discussion

The analysis above has demonstrated that clients use practices traditionally thought to

generate rapport, and they do so with a personal vested interest in the interaction progressing

well. We have seen that while it is difficult to pinpoint ‘rapport’ as a subjective experience in

real interactions, it is possible to see the practices that participants use to generate local

outcomes. These outcomes are available to participants (live) and to analysts, and they permit

constant evaluation of the degree to which participants align, which in turn allows

participants to judge what practices to use next. Practices are directly related to local

(interactional) outcomes. Using one practice over another can lead to statistically significant

differences in local outcomes (see Heritage, Robinson, Elliott, Beckett & Wilkes, 2007;

Stokoe, 2013b).

While the participants in the data presented here had strong motivations for building

rapport (the MP to build the personal vote, and the constituents to get assistance from the MP

despite it not being part of the MP’s main job mandate), there is reason to expect that clients

build rapport and have a stake in rapport in other institutional contexts. Ekström, Lindström

161

and Karlsson’s (2013) study of a loan service show examples of clients having a stake in

connecting with the loan practitioners, in order to better negotiate their loan contract.

Sikveland et al.’s (2016) examination of patients calling their doctor’s office shows examples

of patients initiating extra actions when faced with uncooperative secretaries. In contrast, it is

harder to see rapport, especially client initiated rapport, in data such as Clark et al.’s (2003)

interactions with sales representatives. Comparing the stake that each party has in the

interactions may provide insight into when and how rapport practices arise, as opposed to, or

in conjunction with, practices such as recruitment. Future research should compare rapport to

practices of recruitment (Kendrick & Drew, 2016), as well as examining what practices may

be used to resist rapport and recruitment.

Traditional rapport studies may find it trivial to examine local outcomes instead of

distal outcomes (such as purchasing, satisfaction, quality of testimony, etc.). However, the

study of local outcomes allows analysts to see what practices generate useful and effective

outcomes, and what practices cause interactional difficulties and local problems. This

information can be transmitted to practitioners as concrete, specific instructions on what

practices work best. The Conversation Analytic Role-play Method (CARM, see Stokoe,

2013a, 2013b) systematizes the training process, permitting practitioners to see real

interactions with an analyst’s eye, and see how local outcomes can be cumulatively built into

more macro-scale results. One major challenge for CA researchers today is to determine

precisely how effective CARM is at creating distal outcomes, such as patient satisfaction (see

Sikveland et al., 2016). CA research has often been resistant to linking practices with distal

outcomes, not least because it is difficult to determine which practices, of the hundreds of

instances of practices that occur in any interaction, are the ones that connect to any given

distal outcome. This is one challenge that CA researchers should tackle, however, if they

wish to create usefully applied results.

One difficulty in finding ‘rapport’ in naturalistic (Potter & Hepburn, 2005) settings is

that overt or direct indications of rapport may be considered heavy-handed, insincere, or

false; since rapport is created for a purpose (see Section 6.1), rather than for the sake of

friendliness, its presence can suggest alternative motives. Stokoe, Sikveland and Huma

(2016) reported that efforts to build rapport explicitly in sales cold calling (in which the sales

representatives call prospective buyers unannounced) were seldom reciprocated, and treated

as inapposite. Practices such as opening the calls with ‘How are you today’ or engaging in

small talk did not progress the call’s purpose, and were inappropriate given the lack of

familiarity between the cold caller and the call taker. This suggests that rapport building

162

practices may need to be done subtly, and that ‘successful’ rapport (in the sense of

reciprocated practices with local outcomes that promote progressivity or affiliation) may be

necessarily implicit or unexposed. ‘Doing rapport’ may be problematic: doing genuine

friendliness (or affiliation) that happens to build rapport (or effective local outcomes) is not.

Future research needs to extricate not only which practices lead to what kinds of local

and distal outcomes, but also whether the practices should be considered as building rapport

at all. Many of the practices examined above are considered part of everyday interactional

contingencies – a natural part of (polite, non-aggressive) interaction. While it is possible that

the practices do both rapport building and other conversational actions – and that participants

have the option to take up either aspect in their next turns (Sidnell & Enfield, 2014) – it does

raise the question of whether rapport building practices are doing anything above and beyond

mundane conversational norms. For instance, is rapport only ‘rapport’ when done in an

institutional context, where some mundane norms may be altered or missing? Can we see

rapport as anything beyond ordinary affiliative interaction? If it is not, why is it such a central

concern for institutional practitioners, who have access to interactional norms when outside

institutional contexts? More research is needed to assess how rapport as a concept fits into

conversational norms. This similarity between rapport building and ordinary conversational

practices may account for much of the difficulty in ‘seeing’ rapport in interaction.

In conclusion, my analysis raises two challenges. First, for studies of rapport, the

challenge is to examine rapport building as a set of practices that take place in live

interactions, and to determine what contingencies shape how rapport is done, and whether

rapport is a useful concept above and beyond ordinary conversational norms. Second, for CA,

the challenge is to determine whether we can link practices with distal outcomes, whether we

can see how local outcomes may build cumulatively to distal ones, and whether these

practices are associated with changes in relationships and expectations. Both of these

challenges are unconventional for their respective fields, but both will result in improved

opportunities for practitioners, and a better application of research to training.

Chapter 7:

Discussion

7.0 Summary

In this thesis, I have made two main contributions to our knowledge of the constituency

office. First, I have provided, to the best of my knowledge, the first interactional analysis of

the constituency office, a frequently overlooked part of political life that is more accessible to

the ordinary citizen than ‘mainstream’ political settings such as Parliament. Second, I have

contributed to the conversation analytic literature by being the first to analyze a previously

unstudied institution, which also provided unique insights into institutional talk. I will

summarize my analytic findings below, before turning to the overarching findings of this

thesis, its limitations, potential avenues for future research, and its potential applications in

training constituency office staff.

I began this thesis by demonstrating that the constituency office has been neglected by

both political discourse literature and conversation analytic studies. In the research on

political communication, Cain, Ferejohn and Fiorina (1987) said that constituency office

work was “belonging to a category ranging from baby kissing to bribery – best kept out of

serious academic discussion.” Their statement continued to hold true to this day, especially

for research that investigated the actual activities (and interactions) that comprise

constituency office casework. Most research only considered the possibility that constituency

casework helped to build rapport and the ‘personal vote’, and thus improved the MP’s

chances for re-election (e.g., Butler & Collins, 2001; Johnston & Pattie, 2009; Norris, 1997).

I discussed the difficulty in finding research that was up-to-date (Norton, 1994, and

Rawlings, 1990a, 1990b, for instance, are based on letters) or that examined actual casework

(most are based on reflections about casework, and those reflections are only from the MP- or

staff-perspective, e.g., Koop, 2012; Le Lidec, 2009). The conversation analytic literature has

likewise failed to examine the constituency office, providing the motivation for the research

in this thesis. While institutional studies have examined politicians in other settings (such as

on public broadcasts, e.g., Clayman & Heritage, 2002a; Ekström & Patrona, 2011; Ekström et

al., 2013), as well as other settings that involve service provision (e.g., medical interactions,

Heritage & Maynard, 2006; or street-level bureaucracy, Bruhn & Ekström, 2015), none of

these were identical to the constituency office. My thesis has addressed these shortcomings in

both sets of literature, by providing the first analysis of this setting.

164

In the first analytic chapter, I examined ‘requests’ at the constituency office (or rather, the

lack of turn designs traditionally considered to constitute requests). I found that constituents

use their turns-at-talk to build a case for assistance, achieving the recruitment of assistance,

rather than requesting it outright. I proposed that this is due to the ‘unknown’ nature of the

institution, as some institutional roles and procedures are better known than others (see

Stokoe, 2013b). Constituents used methods for achieving recruitment (Kendrick & Drew,

2016) that have been well-documented before, focusing on demonstrating legitimacy and

reasonableness (see e.g., Curl & Drew, 2008; Heritage & Robinson, 2006; Stokoe &

Edwards, 2007; Stokoe & Hepburn, 2005), and using ‘narrative description’ turn formats

(Zimmerman, 1992). Concerning the question of ‘relevance’, constituents more often

displayed the irrelevance of seeking help from other institutions, rather than the relevance of

the constituency office; this also further supported the idea that constituents were managing

the challenge of the ‘unknown’ nature of the institution. All participants oriented to the

relevance of a transaction of assistance, and any lack of transaction (i.e., no help offered) was

treated as accountable and pursue-able. Finally, I also found that the constituency office staff

guided the way the encounters progressed, by their timely use of offers as compared to

affiliations. The staff used fewer and fewer offers as the meeting progressed, and more and

more affiliations, which reduced the relevancy of offers and allowed the staff to implicitly

instruct constituents on what items were ‘requestable’ or ‘offerable’.

The staff also guided the constituents through the use of different offer formats, a

finding that was discussed in the next analytic chapter. The initial offers for any given

transaction of assistance typically took the format of ‘can I/we’, which treated the offer as a

‘proposal’. Initial offers thus oriented to the potential contingencies associated with offering

(whether the offer was appropriate or desired), and allowed for constituents to act as agents

and decide whether or not to accept. Second offers took the format of ‘I will’, and

‘announced’ that an offer would be completed. These offers did not orient to the constituents’

agency, and treated the offer as already accepted. Further offers took the format of ‘let me’,

or ‘request-offers’. In these offers, staff now asked constituents to permit the offer to be

completed. This allowed constituency office staff to make an acceptance more strongly

relevant, which helped to progress the interaction forward. The ‘request-offer’ was a useful

format for guiding the interaction towards closure, and helped to close off further discussion

on that particular transaction of assistance.

The variety of offer designs has implications for how we, as conversation analysts,

describe turns and actions. The additional action aspects of the offers (proposal,

165

announcement, and request) created overlaps beyond traditional action category ‘boundaries’.

The action of offering can be accomplished through the turn design of a request. Actions do

not always fall neatly into categories or types, and we should not attempt to be more specific

in describing action than participants are in designing one (Hofstetter & Stokoe, 2015;

Stokoe, 2012). CA needs to be better attuned to the multiple trajectories that turns can

accomplish. Also interesting was the way that the offers were oriented to the contingencies

inherent in making an offer – despite the fact that contingency is more usually associated

with requests (Curl & Drew, 2008). This was forecast by Kendrick and Drew (2014), and my

study further analyzes and provides supporting evidence for how contingency can be

actualized in offer design. Finally, Chapter 4 found that offers cannot be solely determined by

who is benefitting from a transaction (Clayman & Heritage, 2014; Couper-Kuhlen, 2014),

given that the MP is certainly benefitting from doing offering by appearing to be aligned with

and supporting his constituents. Even the simplest transaction can have benefits on both

sides, and quantifying these potential benefits does not seem to instruct us about how the

action is carried out.

The third analytic chapter investigated the sequences in which political topics were

made relevant, deconstructing several common tropes in political discourse literature.

Political topics were not raised often, contrary to the expected purpose of constituents in

visiting the constituency office: constituents are expected to use the office as a form of

political engagement or to express political views (Hansard, 2015; Norton, 2012, see Section

7.1). In actual constituency office interactions, the MP tended to raise political topics to

demonstrate the way his political party was aligned with the constituents’ interests. The

constituents tended to raise political topics to complain about a policy that was affecting their

lives. However, as is well known in CA, a topic cannot be selected by one side alone –

interlocutors must all participate in order for a topic to be successful. It is possible for

constituents to attempt to make a political sequence relevant, and for the MP and caseworker

to leave the political components unaddressed (see Chapter 5, Extract 5.7). Another common

assumption in political science literature is that citizens hold political beliefs, values, or

attitudes, and that these attitudes are stable over time. However, within the span of a few

minutes, constituents were seen to adopt different stances towards political issues. The

sequential context was crucial for understanding the attitude expressed, and yet sequential

information is rarely considered in political science studies (Potter & Wetherell, 1987). This

suggests that many findings in political surveys are suspect, and that attitudes may be more

reliant on sequential position than on ‘stable’ personal characteristics or opinions. Finally,

166

constituents were vague when expressing political criticisms, and treated the topics as

delicate. When complimenting the MP, this vagueness vanished. This suggests that

constituents orient to the interactional contingencies of making criticisms first, and the

political concerns they may hold second. Constituents privilege the interactional norms, such

as not criticizing an interlocutor, especially not directly, over making political criticisms

known. This has implications for studies that wish to understand how citizens interact with

their representatives and how they can express their political voice. Constituents cannot

separate their political representative from being a conversational interlocutor, so

interactional norms will apply. If we are to understand or change how citizens interact with

their representatives (or indeed other political people, such as union leaders, protest leaders,

bureaucrats, etc.), we need to address first the interactional norms that promote certain

behaviours and challenge others. We cannot tackle the issue of citizen disengagement from

political conversations without tackling the question of interactional rules.

The final analytic chapter investigated the question of ‘rapport’ in conversation.

‘Rapport’ was particularly salient in this study because of the supposed need for rapport in

building relationships and trust. MPs have a strong interest in building and maintaining

rapport and relationships with constituents, as these feelings are perceived (by MPs and

political staff, Fenno, 1978; see Section 1.2.1) to directly correlate with their future job

prospects: re-election. However, constituents at the constituency office are typically asking

for favours – for the MP to do work beyond their mandated role of legislating new bills and

representing the constituent in Parliament. The MP is not officially a general-purpose

ombudsman, but constituents nevertheless ask for special treatment. Thus, constituents also

have a vested interest in rapport. This is likely true in most service encounters, where the

client wishes to receive the best service. I have found that constituents show a vested interest

in ‘client-side rapport’, and that rapport is not solely the concern of the institutional

practitioner, as it has long been thought to be. I have also found that rapport is typically

conceptualized as a feeling (or outcome) that influences future behaviour, and that it is sought

in order to achieve outcomes. However, CA as a method is capable of tying various practices

to outcomes, bypassing the need to investigate rapport at all. It is possible to determine what

practices lead to better outcomes in service encounters without resorting to a study of rapport.

The main limitation of my thesis is that the data was restricted to one constituency

office. My findings cannot be said to be representative of all British constituency offices,

especially with the wide variances between offices that have been described in the past

(Fenno, 1978; Rawlings, 1990a, 1990b). However, the data in this thesis represents 68

167

different constituents, 56 different cases, and was spread out over the course of six months.

This suggests the data are not solely a case study, but a reasonable first look at the

interactions at this institution. Importantly, the data showed clear and consistent patterns,

suggesting the findings are robust. My findings also show interactional features that are

consistent with prior CA research concerning conversational norms (for instance, the

challenge in criticizing a person face-to-face, see Chapter 5). My data can be compared with

the datasets made available through published CA research, which will contribute to the

wider generalizability of both my own research, and the CA field.

Overall, my thesis has provided the first analysis of in-person interactions with a

politician and caseworkers at the constituency office. We now have a set of data that

demonstrates how constituency casework is managed, and the central role of interaction in its

accomplishment. I have analyzed how constituents, the MP, and the caseworkers negotiate

services, and challenged assumptions about how these actors might engage in politics or

build ‘rapport’. I have added to our understanding of institutional interactions, by analyzing

this ‘new’ institution, and investigating other ways that requests and offers may be

accomplished. In the next section, I will return to some questions that were raised in Chapter

1, and discuss some future avenues for researching this institution.

7.1 The personal vote, context, and communication training

The constituency office has long been examined for its role in creating the ‘personal vote’, or

a sense of rapport or obligation prompting constituents to vote for an incumbent politician

(see Section 1.2.1). My study cannot provide any conclusive evidence as to whether any

constituents would vote for the MP, based on the interactions in this data corpus. I did not

collect data concerning constituents’ voting past behaviour or future intentions, and the fact

that the data came from a single MP’s office means I cannot conclude that any comments

concerning voting behaviour were widespread. As I have mentioned in my analysis of

‘rapport’ (see Chapter 6), there was limited evidence available to the MP or caseworkers (or

to analysts) as to whether the constituents felt a growing rapport with the constituency office

staff, or whether the distal outcome would be in the MP’s favour. While my analysis cannot

conclude whether the MP gained a ‘personal vote’ from any given constituent, I have shown

that the MP and the caseworkers are likewise uncertain about earning a potential vote. This

may explain some of the variance studies find in politicians’ beliefs about the effectiveness of

constituency casework at creating a personal vote: they receive no confirmation in

interactions with constituents as to whether the constituents will be more inclined to vote for

168

the politician in the future. Asking constituents whether they would vote for the politician

after receiving services breaks several social conventions (an institutional practitioner

requesting a favour from a client, for instance), but moreover, my data shows that in at least

one constituency office the MP and caseworkers simply do not ask.

However, I can address what it is like for citizens to interact with a politician in person.

Citizens have limited opportunities to directly speak to a politician. In the past, studies have

examined news interviews with public phone-ins or audience participation, and found that the

host or journalist mediated the talk (see Section 1.3.1 and 1.3.2). The host decided when a

politician had satisfied a question, and when the topic was closed. At the constituency office,

citizens had unmediated access to the politician. The caseworker’s main role was to take

notes or provide information, rather than to mediate discussion. Constituents were able to,

and did, pursue talk of their difficulties. They collaborated with the MP concerning whether

an offer was acceptable. They engaged in non-business related ‘small talk’ at various points

in the encounter, which was not an option in radio or television participation shows. The

MP’s were only occasionally in a position to account for their own actions or for government

action (see Chapter 5; Ekström, 2009), rather than constantly. In summary, the constituency

office is a very different interactional environment from participation shows and news media.

My data is more similar to other, service-related institutions (see Section 1.3.3, 3.1, 3.2).

Both institutional studies and political discourse studies may be interested in how this

data may be a new starting point for the consideration of how context may influence

interaction. Political (discourse) scientists who have encountered my work have been

reluctant to accept CA’s disinterest in macro-scale contextual details, such as political party

preference or membership, gender of participants, socioeconomic status, and so forth. As I

have mentioned in this thesis (see Chapter 2), these macro-scale contextual details were not

analyzed, in part because CA has consistently found that these details do not influence how

interaction is accomplished (Fitzgerald, Housley & Butler, 2009; Schegloff, 1997b; Stokoe,

2008). Consider the status of the constituents in Extract 5.5 as elderly: this detail was not

(empirically) demonstrably used by the MP or caseworker (e.g., as a basis to make a specific

offer, as a basis to empathize about difficulties) until it was made relevant by the constituents

concerning their lack of pension. Extract 5.5 and the whole encounter show how such details

may be ‘true’, but not relevant, until such time as the participants make them so (Sacks,

1992; Schegloff, 1997b). Despite the disinterest of CA in examining demographic details as

context, the subfield of institutional studies allows that context may influence how utterances

are interpreted. For instance, Fox (2015) points out that service settings encourage service

169

providers to hear utterances as requests. Likewise, at the constituency office, descriptions of

problems are heard as making assistance relevant (at specific points). When it comes to

personal attributes, however, such as party affiliation, CA is reluctant to ascribe interpretative

reasoning to the attribute, unless explicitly made relevant by the participants. However, a

future comparison of several constituency offices could provide insight into how personal

attributes, such as party affiliation, may provide a context that influences talk.

As mentioned in Chapter 5, constituents who engaged in criticizing the actions of the

current government appeared to know that such criticisms implicated the MP (who belonged

to the current governing party at the time), and constituents modulated their criticisms

according to interactional norms to address this fact. That the constituents assumed the MP

was implicated in the criticism implies that the constituents may have known to what party

the MP belonged. In other words, the constituents’ choice of actions may have been

influenced by the MP’s party affiliation, something that could be said to be a personal

attribute. This attribute was never discussed within the interaction, and yet it may have

influenced how the constituents chose to criticize the government, and indeed whether they

chose to criticize at all. Future work could involve continued efforts to collect data from both

government and opposition MPs. An opposition MP, in theory, might not be assumed to be

implicated in the same criticism of government policy, since an opposition MP’s role is to

criticize the government’s policy too: they have a reduced accountability for legislation that

is passed. As a result, constituents might be able to criticize the government ‘safely’, and/or

an MP may be able to use his or her affiliation as a resource for welcoming criticizing or

aligning with the constituent. This could provide convincing insight into how macro-scale

contextual details may or may not affect micro-scale interactional proceedings.

However, comparing the influence of opposition and government MPs on constituent

complaints relies on constituents knowing both the MP’s party affiliation, and how

government roles work, neither of which is certain. It is difficult to know whether

constituents did in fact know to what party the MP belonged in the data in this thesis. After

all, it is possible that the constituents assumed criticizing government simply meant

criticizing all MPs, including opposition MPs. The MP and caseworkers reported that

constituents did not consistently know the MP’s name, gender, or age, let alone his party

affiliation – after several years of serving as MP! Likewise, the Hansard Audit of Political

Engagement (2015) has found that 28% of citizens surveyed did not know the political

affiliation of their local MP. Without data concerning an opposition MP, it is not possible to

170

know whether constituents are aware of these changes in context, let alone whether the

change would be made relevant or would influence interactions.

It would also be useful to collect data from ‘secure’ and ‘insecure’ constituencies, given

the significant amount of statistical literature investigating the relation between election

security and constituency casework (see Section 1.2.1). The security of the constituency (how

likely the constituents are to vote for the incumbent MP) is reported to be linked with the

efforts of the MP in doing constituency casework, and this effort may be reflected in

constituency office practices. Although CA has resisted the inclusion of macro-scale

contextual details, such a study could demonstrate whether items such as party affiliation or

job security influence the way the practices are achieved. It is certain that similar actions will

be carried out (the MP will still make offers, the constituents will still balance reasonableness

and legitimacy while making complaints or telling troubles) – but the way in which they are

done may vary systematically. The constituency office provides an opportunity for CA – and

other discourse analytic fields – to re-examine the way it treats context.

My thesis should also prompt fields in political science to re-examine the way they

consider citizens’ political activity. Although Norton (1994, 2012) says that constituents

contact their MP for the purpose of raising political concerns, my thesis does not support this

assertion. It is possible that Norton’s evidence, being from a survey of written letters from the

1980s, is both out of date and of an incomparable format. The letters analyzed by Norton do

not provide the same interactional environment as the encounters in my thesis. Furthermore,

we do not know whether the constituents in Norton’s letters were seeking assistance with

some issue simultaneously to making a criticism. Norton’s claim concerning why

constituents contact their MP is too broad. My results suggest that constituents contact the

MP, at the surgery at least, to solve personal issues and avoid political concerns. This

supports other studies that have focused on the way casework is a last resort for desperate

constituents (Ortiz et al. 2004; Young Legal Aid Lawyers, 2012, 2013). This also supports

survey findings that suggest citizens rarely contact their MP for political purposes; the British

Social Attitudes Survey (BSA) found that only 26% of people have ever contacted their MP

(Simpson & Phillips, 2015), and the Hansard Audit of Political Engagement found that only

12% of people had contacted their MP in the last year (2015). Both of these surveys found

that more citizens reported they would be willing to contact their MP if they ‘felt strongly

enough about an issue’ (Hansard’s wording) (Hansard 33%; BSA 40%), but being willing

and actually doing an action are not the same. My findings provide some explanation for this

discrepancy. The interactional difficulty of criticizing a person implicated in the criticism is a

171

challenge that constituents must overcome in order to criticize government policy to their

MP.

Finally, the findings of this thesis can be applied to create training programs for MPs

and caseworkers. CA findings have successfully been applied in the past to create training

material (Drew et al., 2010; Heritage, Robinson, Elliott, Beckett & Wilkes, 2007), most

notably with the Conversation Analytic Role-play Method (CARM - Stokoe, 2014). Stokoe’s

CARM program presents CA findings directly to practitioners, so that they can see how

sequences unfold ‘live’, and benefit from an understanding of how interactional norms

govern our practices. A brief CARM workshop was given as feedback to the constituency

office in this study, focusing on the practice of opening calls and meetings with ‘How can I

help’ (see Section 3.1). The use of this opening move officially begins the encounter, even

after non-business oriented talk has taken place. One caseworker at the office in this study

reported that, after my CARM feedback session, she implemented the practice of ‘How can I

help’, consciously. She reported that it could be implemented to reduce the length of her

meetings with constituents by several minutes, and was extremely useful for curtailing the

sometimes over-long pre-meeting ‘small talk’.

There are several other potential practices that will likely be useful for training. I

highlight a selection here, based on the Chapters in this thesis (although there are others):

a)   Affiliation can be used to reduce the relevance of an offer. When a constituent

complains or tells a trouble, it is possible to reduce the interactional pressure of

making an offer by affiliating.

b)   Constituents appear to have little knowledge of what a constituency office can

do. MPs and caseworkers can guide constituents through the meeting and

implicitly ‘teach’ constituents what is requestable and/or offerable. The design

of offers is crucial to guiding constituents on whether they should press for

further or different assistance.

c)   Constituents appear to resist the closing-aspects of turns, such as offers. More

overt closings are required to end the meeting.

d)   Constituents appear to resist information about government activity that

supports their cause, as the pre-existence of that activity makes their difficulty

less legitimate and urgent.

e)   Rapport need not be a concern. Practices are a better way to train staff. Current

training for caseworkers still focuses on building rapport (see Work for MPs

2016).

172

It is worth noting that there was very little interest in training for constituency office staff (as

opposed to the widespread difficulty reported by doctors in soliciting additional concerns in

consultations, see Heritage et al., 2007; or the difficulty in convincing clients to try

mediation, see Stokoe, 2013b). MPs and caseworkers across Canada and the United Kingdom

seemed surprised by the idea that their talk practices could be improved. I suggest that this is

in part due to ignorance of available training options, such as CARM, but also due to the

desperation of the constituents who visit the office. Any aid, even if it is inefficiently or

ineffectively done, is likely to be received with enormous gratitude, given the circumstances

of many constituents. Furthermore, in this particular corpus, there were few interactional

difficulties that consistently led to problematic outcomes – unlike the consistent difficulties

faced by mediators in securing clients (Stokoe, 2013b). This may be due to the highly

experienced caseworkers, who had been working in the field for many years. Future studies

may wish to target constituency offices where the caseworkers are less experienced in order

to see potentially less effective practices.

Overall, this thesis has provided a new perspective in the study of institutional talk,

from a new institution with its own unique features. I have laid a foundation upon which

future studies of constituency offices can build. Furthermore, future studies of political

interaction, especially interaction between ordinary citizens and politicians, now have a point

of comparison. Our understanding of the relationship between citizen and representative has

been enriched and expanded, and many disciplines can benefit from this new knowledge.

MPs and their staff have been quietly providing services to constituents for decades,

with little academic interest in how casework is accomplished. Now, we finally have an

understanding of the central role that interaction takes in assisting constituents, and an

appreciation of the kind of work that MPs and their staff provide everyday. It is precisely this

ordinariness that should inspire investigation, and prompt continued research into overlooked

settings.

Jefferson Transcription Symbols

t[alk Square brackets mark the start and end of overlapping speech. [Yeah, They are aligned to mark the precise position of overlap. h i Vertical arrows precede marked pitch movement, over and above normal rhythms of speech. They are used for notable changes in pitch beyond those represented by stops, commas and question marks. Underlining Indicates emphasis; the extent of underlining within individual words locates emphasis and also indicates how heavy it is. CAPITALS Mark speech that is hearably louder than surrounding speech. This is beyond the increase in volume indicated by underlines. °I know it,° ‘Degree’ signs enclose hearably quieter speech. (0.4) Numbers in round brackets measure pauses in seconds (in this case, 4 tenths of a second). (.) A micropause, hearable but too short to measure. ((stoccato)) Additional comments from the transcriber, e.g. about features of context or delivery. ((lines omitted)) Also to indicate material omitted for brevity. (I know) Text in single round brackets to indicate best guess at hard-to-hear utterance. Can also be blank to indicate something spoken but unhearable. she wa::nted Colons show degrees of elongation of the prior sound; the more colons, the more elongation. hhh Aspiration (out-breaths); proportionally as for colons. .hhh Inspiration (in-breaths); proportionally as for colons. Yeh, Comma: ‘Continuation’ marker, speaker has not finished; marked by weak rising intonation, as when delivering a verbal list. y’know? Question mark: strong rise in intonation, irrespective of grammar. okay¿ Inverse question mark indicates tone between a comma and a question mark in rise. Yeh. Full stop: marks falling, stopping intonation (‘final contour’), irrespective of grammar, not necessarily followed by a pause. bu- u- Hyphens mark a cut-off of the preceding sound. >he said< ‘Greater than’ and ‘lesser than’ signs enclose utterances that are faster than surrounding talk. <he said> Reverse indicates utterances that are slower than surrounding talk. solid.= ‘Equals’ signs mark the immediate ‘latching’ of successive talk, =We had whether of one or more speakers, with no interval. sto(h)p i(h)t Laughter within speech is signalled by h’s in round brackets.

Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form

Note: originally on 2, single sided sheets of A4

The Constituency Office: A study of the surgeries of Members of

Parliament in Canada and the United Kingdom

Participant Information Sheet for Surgery Visitors Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research project, run by Prof. Elizabeth Stokoe and Emily Hofstetter of Loughborough University. Prof Stokoe is an expert in human conversation, and has been working with professional organizations to record interactions since 1997. She researches conversations to identify effective practice, which feeds back into training programs. Ms. Hofstetter is completing her Doctor of Philosophy degree, under the supervision of Prof. Stokoe. This project examines communication between politicians and their constituents, as well as telephone inquiries into the offices of Members of Parliament. Ms. Hofstetter is interested in examining how communities use the services of MP surgeries, and how MPs communicate with the public. The project involves making recordings of how MPs and their surgery staff interact with the public, both on the telephone and in person. What do I have to do? Nothing! Your meeting will be recorded as it would normally run, using a video camera. All the information recorded will be kept confidential. The recordings cannot be used as part of any parties’ legal proceedings. You have the right to withdraw from the research until publication (timing varies). If you would like to withdraw, please contact us, and if publications have already occurred, we will remove your data from any future work. Ethics and confidentiality 1.   Any recordings made will be stored securely and only anonymized data, in which participants

(MPs, office staff, and constituents) cannot be identified, may be used in research papers and training workshops. Prof. Stokoe and Ms. Hofstetter use software that deletes names and other identifying features, and transform voices by altering their pitch. 2.   As a doctoral student of Loughborough University, Emily Hofstetter is bound by professional codes

of conduct. As an employee of Loughborough University, and as a Chartered Psychologist, Prof Stokoe is likewise bound by professional codes of conduct. Because Prof. Stokoe also works with police investigative interviews she has also been subject to ‘CRB’ checks.

202

All this means that if either Ms. Hofstetter or Prof. Stokoe were to use the data in an unethical way she would be guilty of academic misconduct. She will work with your data responsibly. If participants are unhappy with how the research is conducted, the University has a policy relating to Research Misconduct and Whistle Blowing: www.lboro.ac.uk/admin/committees/ethical/Whistleblowing(2).htm, and participants may contact the Secretary for the University’s Ethics Approvals (Human Participants) Sub-Committee: Ms. Green, Research Office, Hazlerigg Bldg, Loughborough University, Epinal Way.
