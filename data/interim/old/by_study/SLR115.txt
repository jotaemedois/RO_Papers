ABSTRACT

This article investigates how and why the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (GPL) and the people of Gauteng differ in defining and measuring GPL performance, also referred to as effectiveness. The article recommends measures to bridge the gap between how the GPL and Gauteng citizens define and measure GPL performance. The findings of the qualitative research revealed that from an internal perspective, the GPL defines and measures performance using the performance model which focuses on inputs, activities, and outputs. However, the citizens assess the performance of the GPL using the expectation disconfirmation model, which emphasises outcomes. This means the GPL and the citizens define and assess GPL effectiveness using different lenses causing a disjuncture in the results. On the one hand, the internal perspective lens showed that the GPL has been relatively effective. On the other hand, the external perspective lens revealed that the GPL has been performing sub-optimally. Consequently, the article recommends that the GPL should embrace, and correctly balance the use of the performance, and the expectation disconfirmation models. This would bridge the gap between results of the internal and external effectiveness of the GPL. The article makes a seminal contribution in two ways. First, by making it clear that the practitioners need to focus on the expectations of

INTRODUCTION

South Africa adopted the outcomes or results-based approach in 2009 and effectiveness also referred to as performance in this article is thus measured at outcomes level (Republic of South Africa 2009:12). Effectiveness refers to the achievement of the legislature’s mandate, namely law-making, oversight and scrutiny, and public participation, as stipulated in Chapter four of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996. The mandate is about serving the citizens which is associated with achieving outcomes such as improved accountability, transparency, and participation; and not outputs such as reports (Parliamentary Centre and World Bank Institute (WBI) n.d.:9). This article seeks to document part of the findings of the research that critically analysed the appropriateness of the GPL performance measurement framework to establish the effectiveness of the GPL. One component of the main research involved investigating how and why the GPL and the people of Gauteng differ in defining and measuring effectiveness, which is the focus of this article. The article recommends measures to bridge the gap between how the GPL and Gauteng citizens define and measure performance.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Available literature shows that public institutions have not been very effective. For example, using corruption as a proxy indicator for government performance, Gordon, Roberts, Struwig and Dumisa (2012:12) conducted a study that revealed that 74% of South Africans believed the incidence of corruption had increased in the past three years. Notably, 10% of South Africans were of the view that corruption had declined; while 12% indicated that it had remained the same over the period. 63% of South Africans mentioned that the government and parliament were not doing enough to fight corruption (Gordon et al. 2012:12&14). In the eyes of the citizens, this points to poor performance by the government and the

citizens to improve perceived performance. This is a shift from a predominantly performance model to the expectation disconfirmation model.

parliament of South Africa because their efforts have not been resulting in less corruption and good governance (Matebese-Notshulwana & Lebakeng 2020:200; Pelizzo & Stapenhurst 2013:1). To further demonstrate the non-optimal performance of the South African public institutions, research findings of a relatively recent study that was conducted by Wike, Simmons, Stokes and Fetterolf (2017:2) revealed that 22% of the public had a lot of trust and another 22% had some level of trust in their South African government and this translated to 44% of South Africans that gave an affirmative response. Among the surveyed African countries, South Africa scored the lowest in terms of trust at 44% as compared to Tanzania (89%), Ghana (70%), Kenya (68%), Senegal (60%), and Nigeria (54%) (Wike et al. 2017:2). Taking a look at the results at a global level, the same study revealed that people in the sub-Saharan Africa (save for South Africa and Nigeria) and Asia-Pacific regions trusted their national governments more compared to those from Latin America, the Middle East, and southern Europe (Wike et al. 2017:2). In the same study, 56% of South Africans registered their dissatisfaction with the way democracy was working in the country as compared to a median of 38% and 52% for the surveyed African countries and globally respectively (Wike et al. 2017:2). The fact that 44% and 56% of South Africans that were surveyed trusted the government and were dissatisfied with the way democracy worked, respectively in 2017, suggests that the country still had some work to do to boost the trust levels in the government and how democracy works as perceived by the public. Moving away from the public sector in general to looking at performance of parliaments in particular, a study that was conducted by Beetham (2006 in Rolef 2006:9) revealed that using trust as a proxy for effectiveness; parliaments from both developed and developing nations have been less effective. The study revealed that 42% of the people in East Asia trusted their parliament, followed by Africa at 41%, and then the European Union at 35%, Latin America at 16% and finally Europe at 14% (Beetham 2006 in Rolef 2006:9). The Conference Board of Canada (2019:Online) further confirms low citizens’ trust levels in developed countries’ parliaments by indicating that they (trust levels) have been on a downward trend for an extended period of time. The developed countries’ average confidence/trust levels in their parliaments fell from 47% in the 1980s, to 42% in the 1990s, and further to 39% in the 2000s (Conference Board of Canada 2019:Online). As with the developed nations, public trust in the parliament of South Africa also fell from 66% in 1990 to 45% in 2013 (Holmberg, Lindberg & Svensson 2015:5) and further down to 25% in 2017 (Parliament of the Republic of South Africa 2018:6,7). Based on these trust facts, it can be concluded that parliaments from both developing and developed countries have not been sub-optimally performing.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Although from an internal perspective, as documented in the annual reports, the GPL seems to have been relatively effective; from an external perspective as expressed in the background information section and by the people of Gauteng, the GPL has been underperforming. This suggests that the GPL and citizens have been measuring effectiveness differently. This is a problem because if the status quo remains, there will continue to be a disjuncture between what the GPL offers and does, and the needs of the citizens. This is an undesirable situation considering that the GPL is not supposed to be self-serving but constitutionally mandated to serve the people of Gauteng. Should legislatures not reach their constitutional mandate, the lives of ordinary citizens would remain unimproved and the public would also lose confidence and trust in legislatures, and possibly resort to violent public protests and voter apathy (Schulz-Herzenberg 2014:1). Once confidence and trust in legislatures are lost by the public, it means there will be no need for their (legislatures) existence, which in turn means taking away the voice of the ordinary citizens; excluding them from deciding their destinies. It is vital to understand how and why the citizens and the GPL differ in defining and measuring effectiveness and find a way of bridging the gap. The following section outlines some models that could be used as lenses to understand and find a solution to this undesirable situation.

CITIZENS’ SATISFACTION WITH SERVICES

According to DeHoog, Lowery and Lyons (1990:807) and Mangai (2016:93) there are four models that can be used to explain why citizens may be pleased or displeased with government service. The four models are performance, expectation disconfirmation, individual and jurisdictional (Mangai 2016:93) which are discussed in that order.

The performance model

According to Roos and Lidström (2014:137), the performance model argues that citizens’ satisfaction is derived from the availability of inputs such as policies and outputs such as welfare services, and roads delivered by public institutions. This model views satisfaction verdicts as influenced just by the availability and performance of a service or product (Van Ryzin 2004:434). This suggests that the model focuses mainly on operational matters (inputs, activities, and outputs).

Administratio Publica  |  Vol 31 No 4 December 2023 75

The expectation disconfirmation model

This model begins with the idea that persons who pass judgements about a service or product already have some expectations about the service or product’s benefits or characteristics (Chatterjee & Suy 2019:244; Mangai 2016:93; James 2011:1419; Oliver 1980:460). The model got its name from the difference between what people expected to receive or experience and what they actually experienced after using a service or product. Thus, expectancy disconfirmation is the difference between expectations and the actual performance and this can either be positive or negative (Van Ryzin 2004:434). Positive disconfirmation is when performance of a service as experienced by a consumer exceeds expectation and negative disconfirmation is when performance falls short of expectations (Van Ryzin 2004:434; Oliver 1980:460). This model predicts that while high performance or low expectations lead to more positive disconfirmation which in turn results in better satisfaction levels, high expectations or low performance produce further negative disconfirmation which in turn result in lower satisfaction levels (Horáková 2020:62; James 2011:1419; Van Ryzin 2004:436; Yi 1989:20). Thus, for this model, satisfaction is theorised as citizens’ summary judgements about the difference between what they experienced pertaining to a service and their expectations (Mangai 2016:94; James 2011:1425; Van Ryzin 2004:436). A simplistic way of showing the difference between the performance and expectation disconfirmation models is as follows: For the performance model, an increase in outputs results in increased satisfaction levels (Roos and Lidström 2014:137), but for the expectation disconfirmation model, enhanced outcomes (positive disconfirmation) (Yi 1989:2) leads to improved satisfaction levels. In the language of MANCP Network (2015:5), the performance model is about the operational objectives which are short-term and within the direct control of an organisation. The expectation disconfirmation model is about strategic or medium-term objectives, which are outside the direct control of an organisation (MANCP Network 2015:5).

The individual and jurisdictional models

For the individual model the variables for citizen satisfaction are gender, race, income, age, home ownership, local political efficacy, general political efficacy and community attachment (DeHoog et al. 1990:810). In other words, citizen satisfaction is determined by demographic factors, political efficacy and how attached an individual is to a community they live in. For the jurisdictional model, which is not very different from the individual model, the satisfaction variables are the prominent racial composition of an area, jurisdiction average income level, socio-economic matrix of a neighbourhood, whether the area functions under a

Administratio Publica  |  Vol 31 No 4 December 2023 76

fragmented or consolidated government system, and the quality and quantity of services provided in a jurisdiction (DeHoog et al. 1990:812). The jurisdictional model argues that people tend to cluster together in certain communities based on their socio-economic status (DeHoog et al. 1990:810). This clustering is influenced by related expectations of the people that form a community (Mangai 2016:94; DeHoog et al. 1990:811; Sharp 1986:70–71). For example, the upper-class areas are usually interested in amenities such as restaurants, parks and health clubs, while the working-class value housekeeping services such as refuse collection and the lower-class areas push for social services such as food programmes, and primary healthcare (Mangai 2016:94, 2017:40–41; DeHoog et al. 1990:811; Sharp 1986:70–71).

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

The study employed the interpretivist scientific approach or qualitative methodology which assumes multiple realities in understanding and explaining a phenomenon. Since not much is known about how and why citizens and the GPL differ in defining and measuring effectiveness, an exploratory case study design was employed to investigate the phenomenon. Data was gathered through analysing 31 GPL documents and interviewing seven purposefully selected individuals in the GPL with planning and performance reporting as one of their major Key Performance Areas (KPA). The semi-structured individual interviews were done to supplement and triangulate data obtained from the following 31 documents:

Q Q One 2015/16–2019/20 strategic plan.

Q Q Five 2015/16–2019/20 APPs.

Q Q Five 2015/16–2019/20 annual reports.

Q Q One 2020/21–2024/25 strategic plan.

Q Q Three APPs (2020/21; 2021/22; 2022/23).

Q Q Two annual reports (2020/21; 2021/22).

Q Q Three GPL regulatory documents (Framework for Integrated Planning, Budgeting, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (PBMER); Standing rules and Processes and procedures manual).

Q Q 11 GPL evaluations.

This study focused on documents from the fifth (2015–2019) and sixth (2020– 2024) legislature strategic terms mainly because records management in the GPL is poor making it very difficult to access documents from the earlier legislature strategic terms. To comply with ethical requirements for studies that involve human participants and unpublished documents, the study was guided by the Belmont ethics

Administratio Publica  |  Vol 31 No 4 December 2023 77

code which is founded on three basic principles of respect for persons, beneficence and justice (Al Tajir 2018:2; Belmont Report 1979:4). To proceed with the study, an ethical clearance letter was obtained from UNISA after obtaining permission from the Secretary to use the GPL as a case study. Consent to conduct interviews and record them was sought and obtained from each of the seven interviewees, whose confidentiality was upheld.

RESEARCH FINDINGS

This section is divided into two sub-sections. Findings on how effectiveness is defined and measured from an internal perspective or by the GPL and by the people of Gauteng are presented in the first and second section respectively.

GPL effectiveness from an internal perspective

The analysis of 31 documents revealed that while the word effectiveness is present in almost all of the documents, the term was defined in five documents only, namely the 2015–2019 strategic plan, 2019/20 APP, 2020–2025 strategic plan, GPL public perception survey of 2015 and the Evaluation of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature Oversight Mechanisms/Tools study of 2018. In the 2015–2019 strategic plan the definition of effectiveness is about the degree to which an objective was/will be likely to be achieved. Considering that objectives can be operational, or strategic, the foregoing definition can mean either achieving operational and/or strategic objectives; meaning the definition is not explicit. In the 2019/20 APP and the 2020/21–2024/25 strategic plan, effectiveness is defined as doing the right things and about the working or not working of a strategy, respectively. Both definitions are not very clear, but the words ‘doing’ and ‘working’ are associated with execution, and not result or effect. This suggests that the two definitions are at operational level and not strategic. The remaining two definitions in the 2015 perception survey report and the 2018 oversight report are about outcomes/impacts. The varying definitions of effectiveness for one institution prompted the need to engage the seven participants to gain a better understanding of how effectiveness is defined in the GPL. Responses from all the participants showed that effectiveness in the GPL is associated with achieving some results of some sort or accomplishment of a task. However, the participants differed in their views of the level of results to be achieved. For example, participant one mentioned that in their view, effectiveness has to do with achievement of strategic outcomes linked to the impact on the lives of the people but went further to qualify that in the GPL, effectiveness is

interpreted at operational level. Participants four, five and seven were also very clear that in the GPL effectiveness is interpreted at an operational level associated with activities and outputs not outcomes or impacts. Participant two associated effectiveness with execution of plans or recommendations contained in reports, which is about processes as mentioned by participants four, five and seven. Thus, participant two insinuated that the GPL is not effective because it has not been implementing some of its processes. Participants three and six mentioned that in the GPL, effectiveness is about making sure that things are working according to plan or specifications regardless of level (operational or strategic). This again shows that effectiveness in the GPL is understood at implementation or operational level. However, both participants agreed that there is something wrong with the current approach. While participant three did not clarify the exact nature of the challenge, participant six was very clear that there is a need for the GPL to consider the expectation of citizens/ impact in its definition and understanding of effectiveness as indicated by participant one. Based on an understanding of effectiveness in the GPL, which is mainly at operational level, the following paragraphs outline performance of the GPL during the fifth and sixth legislature strategic terms. GPL performance information presented in Tables 1 and 2, was extracted from the GPL annual reports which are compiled by GPL staff and audited by the Auditor General of South Africa. This is the performance of the GPL from an internal perspective. During the fifth Legislature strategic term, the GPL achieved 72% of its targets in the 2015/16 financial year. The GPL saw an improvement for the following two financial years at 81% and 87% achievement of set targets in the 2016/17 and the 2017/18 financial years respectively. Unfortunately, performance dropped by 3% to 84% in the 2018/19 financial year and further dropped to 75% in the 2019/20 financial year. On average, the GPL achieved 75% of its targets set for the fifth Legislature strategic term as presented in Table 1. Performance dropped to 67% for the first year (2020/21) of the sixth Legislature strategic term as depicted in Table 2. The main contributor to this drop was the Covid-19 pandemic which caused some of the activities of the GPL such as oversight visits to be temporarily suspended, especially during levels five and four lockdown periods. Lockdown levels five and four, called for minimal physical human interaction. Nonetheless, performance improved to 83% of the targets achieved during the second year (2021/22) of the sixth Legislature strategy. Performance improved because the lockdown levels had been reduced which allowed reasonable physical activities. Moreover, the GPL had put measures in place to allow virtual or remote working where necessary. For example, some public participation activities, House committee meetings and House sittings were done online where

necessary. As shown in Table 2, the average performance for the two financial years of the sixth Legislature strategic term stood at 76% of targets achieved. During the 2015/16 to 2019/20 term, best performance was witnessed in cooperative governance at 88% (see Table 1). This success was attributed partially to well-functioning and established structures such as the forums for the Speakers, Petitions and Public Accounts as well as technical teams like the Secretaries’ Association of the Legislatures of South Africa (SALSA) that support cooperative governance activities (GPL 2015:22). Cooperative governance is followed by targets for improved public confidence in the GPL which were achieved at 80%. Oversight, public participation, and law-making targets achieved were all above two thirds at 76%, 70%, and 66% respectively. In terms of the six objectives the GPL had for the term, Modernised business practices towards supporting the

functions of the Legislature performed the worst at 55% met targets. Seemingly, a general insufficient awareness of the benefits of ICT in the GPL, aggravated by the lack of clear records management processes and a knowledge management strategy as well as relevant capacity and skills to effect the transformation process in the institution, are some of the reasons provided for this unsatisfactory performance of 55% (GPL 2015:17 & GPL 2020a:29). As with the fifth Legislature strategic term, for the first two years of the sixth Legislature strategic term, cooperative governance performed the best at 100% of all targets being achieved (see Table 2). Law-making followed at 88%, followed by public participation and compliance with relevant fiduciary requirements and good governance principles targets at 75% and 74% targets achievement respectively. Oversight performed the worst at 67% of targets achieved both from the mandates and objectives perspectives for the sixth Legislature strategic term. The oversight mandate requires substantial interaction with the citizens and service delivery sites. As mentioned, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some of the oversight activities were suspended temporarily, hence a drop in performance compared to all other objectives and activities of the GPL. Participants were engaged to get further clarity on reasons behind the performance of the GPL. Participant one mentioned family emergencies and emerging priorities or unforeseen circumstances which led to cancellation of planned activities, as some of the reasons behind sub-optimal performance by the GPL. Participant five attributed inadequate performance by the GPL to poor planning. In their view, the so-called emerging priorities were a symptom of poor planning. In addition to poor planning mentioned by participant one, lack of professionalism and boldness as well as willingness to do the right thing were stated by participant two as some of the reasons behind sub-optimal performance by the GPL. Participant six cited capacity limitations and negligence. Participants three, four and seven avoided the question.

GPL effectiveness from an external perspective

As stated in the background section, citizen trust as a proxy for effectiveness in both developed and developing countries’ public institutions has been dropping in recent years. GPL documents which form part of the study were reviewed to investigate if the same trend also applies to the GPL. Figure 1 presents results on Gauteng public’s trust in the GPL from various studies that were conducted by the GPL. Figure 1 shows that the Gauteng public’s trust in the GPL dropped from 63% in 2015 to 42% in 2019 but went up a bit to 56% in 2020 and dropped again drastically to 27% in 2023. This trend supports what literature says about the dwindling trust levels in public institutions, including the GPL. To confirm the

Administratio Publica  |  Vol 31 No 4 December 2023 82

foregoing statement, it is imperative to explore the performance of the GPL from a mandate perspective. Accordingly, in the following three sections the performance of the GPL in achieving, from an external perspective, the constitutional mandates, namely public participation, oversight, and law-making is presented and discussed.

Public participation mandate performance of the GPL Through the public participation mandate, citizens’ views are heard with the possibility of influencing policy for the benefit of the citizens. Consequently, it is vital to examine the effectiveness of the GPL’s public participation mandate to corroborate information about declining trust levels in the GPL. For the GPL, a review of the institutional documents which form part of the study revealed that the GPL has and uses an array of public participation mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms include the petitions system, public education, sector parliaments and public hearings (HSRC 2015:31). Thus, the GPL is aligned to best practices for the provision of an array of mechanisms and programmes. However, regarding deliberative democracy associated with the inclusiveness and equality of participants, a review of the GPL’s past evaluations revealed suboptimal performance by the GPL as depicted in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, there was a decline from 52% to 24% and 53% to 24% of the people of Gauteng who mentioned that the GPL conducts business in an open and transparent manner and is accessible to all people living in Gauteng, respectively. There was also a drop from 55% to 16% of the residents of Gauteng who indicated that communication from the GPL was clear and effective to

enable deliberative democracy. Results of an earlier GPL perception survey study that was conducted in 2015 showed that the GPL had been struggling in the area of deliberative democracy for some time. For instance, only 38% of the 2015 household survey participants believed that the GPL provided an effective forum for debate (HSRC 2015:66). Inadequate time allocated to public participation activities (Ipsos Public Affairs 2020: 39–41); ineffective communication associated with poor information provision and use of communication channels not favoured by the public (Ipsos Global Reputation Centre 2019:32) were cited as some of the reasons for the poor rating for GPL public participation. The people of Gauteng cited television, social media and radio as the most preferred communication channels as opposed to the traditional methods such as physical public meetings and awareness campaigns that the GPL has always been using (Citofield 2023:79; Ipsos Public Affairs 2020:52). As with deliberative democracy, the GPL was also found wanting in the extent to which public involvement influences the policymaking process in the GPL as shown in Table 4. Table 4 shows a decline from 37% to 23% and 50% to 27% of the people of Gauteng who perceived that their inputs were considered by the GPL in decisionmaking resulting in an improved quality of life of citizens, respectively. In 2015 the number of people of Gauteng who believed that their vote was effective in influencing decision-making within government was 55% (HSRC 2015:49). This figure echoes findings of a study that was conducted in 2016 wherein a total of

123 GPL committee oversight reports for departmental budgets and annual reports for the 2014/15 financial year were analysed. These reports exposed that “across the board, civil society attendance in Committee oversight meetings was high at 76%, and 61% of oversight reports confirmed that submissions were made. However, only 22% of reports confirmed that Committees applied submissions made in their recommendations and evidence of feedback being provided to communities was evident in only 2% of reports that were analysed” (Brügge 2016:18). Overall, in the eyes of the people of Gauteng, the GPL has been performing poorly in executing the public participation mandate. In 2019, 34% of the people of Gauteng gave an affirmative response regarding the execution of the public participation mandate by the GPL and this figure went down to 18% in 2023 (Citofield 2023:108).

Law-making mandate performance of the GPL As far as law-making is concerned, the main objective of the GPL is to make laws that are responsive to the needs of the people of Gauteng. Thus, it is imperative to investigate the extent to which the GPL’s law-making mandate has been effective or responsive to the needs of the citizens, which is the focus of the ensuing paragraphs. Effectiveness in making laws should not only be about the number of Bills passed by a legislature, but also about making sure that adopted Bills meet the needs of the citizens. Put differently, effectiveness in executing the law-making mandate should be assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. For the GPL, quantitative performance or results of the number of laws that were passed by the GPL from 1994 (when democracy was attained) to date are presented in Figure 2.

Information presented in Figure 2 was obtained from two sources. Information for the period 1994/95 to 2013/14 was obtained from the Twenty Years of Institution Building and Democratic Consolidation Assessment Report that was compiled in 2015 (GPL 2015b:43). Due to the poor records management in the GPL as stated in the methodology section, records of the total number of laws that were passed between 2014/15 and 2016/17 could not be found at all. For the period 2017/18 to 2022/23, information was mined from the GPL’s electronic Monitoring and Evaluation data bases. As can be seen from Figure 2, during the first Legislature (1994/95– 1998/99), the GPL passed 53 laws. During the second Legislature (1999/2000– 2003/04), 52 laws were passed. Most of the laws were passed (initiated and/ or amended) during the first and second Legislatures to address the ills of apartheid. The number of laws passed went down to 24 and 22 during the third (2004/05–2008/09) and fourth (2009/10–2013/14) Legislatures respectively. This is because most of the laws associated with apartheid had already been dealt with during the first and second Legislatures (HSRC 2015:29). During the fifth Legislature (2014/15–2018/19), where information for three financial years could not be found; four and nine laws were passed in 2017/18 and 2018/19 respectively. For the sixth Legislature (2019/20–2023/24), which is left with approximately one financial year to end, 16 laws had been passed at the time of data gathering. This narrative is in support of what is available in literature that quantitative performance of legislatures as far as law-making is concerned is very impressive.

However, it is likewise imperative to assess the law-making mandate qualitatively, which is the focus of the next paragraphs. Between 2015 and 2023 the GPL experienced a significant decline of 75% of people satisfied with how the GPL executes the law-making mandate as depicted in Figure 3. Some of the people of Gauteng mentioned that they were dissatisfied as most of the laws did not speak to their needs because of poor public consultations (Ipsos Public Affairs 2020:36). Poor implementation of passed laws was also mentioned by the people of Gauteng as one of the reasons for their dissatisfaction with the law-making mandate (Ipsos Public Affairs 2020:37). In summary, the GPL has been passing a reasonable number of laws over the years performing relatively well quantitatively. However, qualitatively, the performance of the GPL has been on a downward trajectory as depicted in Figure 3. This has implications on the operations of the GPL for the execution of its lawmaking mandate. For example, citizens have been bemoaning laws that are not fully responsive to their needs. Thus, future law-making strategies must be geared towards correcting these undesirable results.

Oversight and scrutiny mandate performance of the GPL The main aim of oversight and scrutiny in the GPL is to influence service delivery by the Executive for the benefit of the people of Gauteng. Consequently, it is vital to investigate how the oversight mandate of the GPL has been effective, and this is done in Figure 4 and the following paragraphs.

Figure 4 shows that the perceptions of the people of Gauteng regarding how the GPL has been executing the oversight and scrutiny mandate has been on a downward trajectory. In 2015, the majority (87%) of the people of Gauteng mentioned that they were satisfied with how the GPL was executing the oversight and scrutiny mandate. The figure went down to 31% in 2019 and further down to 14% in 2023. This finding about the GPL supports what is available in literature that the performance of both developing and developed nations’ parliaments has been on a downward trajectory. Several reasons have been advanced for this sub-optimal performance by the GPL. One of them is capacity. For the GPL, in a study that was conducted in 2018, it was found that the GPL had capacity in terms of head count but lacked capacity in terms of skills to execute the oversight functions effectively (Brügge 2018:107). For example, most of the GPL oversight recommendations that were examined in 2018 were found to be information-seeking because of inadequate skills to develop explanation- and remediation-seeking (press for action) recommendations which result in improved oversight and service delivery (Brügge 2018:107). The same challenge of not passing explanation-seeking and remediation oversight recommendations was exposed in the 2023 perception survey study (Citofield 2023:30). In the perception survey of 2023, 93% of the study respondents strongly disagreed with the statement that the GPL had highly skilled MPLs and staff (Citofield 2023:117) to develop and pass meaningful resolutions that result in service delivery, among other activities.

It is vital to note that the citizens usually regard the government as one entity and do not consider the three arms of the state, namely the Executive, Judiciary, and the Legislature as being different (Citofield 2023:17). Thus, poor performance by the Executive, for example, in service delivery would affect how the citizens perceive the effectiveness of the GPL. To support the foregoing point, the 2023 Gauteng perception survey found that the increasing cost of living, interest rates, and load-shedding challenges which were experienced countrywide influenced how the people of Gauteng rated the performance of the GPL (Citofield 2023:17). Lack of political will is stated in literature as another reason for sub-optimal performance by legislatures in fulfilling their constitutional mandate. Lack of political will to conduct oversight effectively is partly because of the South African political system that promotes allegiance to the political party as opposed to the Constitution and the citizens (Brügge 2018:89). In South Africa, at the time of writing this article, it has not been individuals that were voted into office but political parties. In most cases the senior members of political parties take up positions in the Executive branch of the state, and the junior members sit in legislatures and find it odd to hold their seniors accountable. This situation which does not promote political will to serve the citizens fully, impedes the full execution of the oversight mandate by legislatures and stifles service delivery which affects how the citizens perceive the GPL. Service delivery was also found to be suffocated in Gauteng by corruption (Ipsos Public Affairs 2020:18; Ipsos Global Reputation Centre 2019:35; Brügge 2018:87; HSRC 2015:59).

RECOMMENDATIONS

It was concluded that from an internal perspective the GPL measures its performance or effectiveness using the performance model. However, from an external perspective the citizens measure using the expectation disconfirmation model. Considering that the GPL is a public institution that is constitutionally mandated to serve the citizens, it is recommended that the GPL shift from a predominantly performance model and strongly embrace the expectation disconfirmation model. However, this does not mean that the GPL should ignore the operational space which is comprised of inputs, activities, and outputs. In short it is recommended that the GPL should embrace, and correctly balance the use of the performance, and the expectation disconfirmation models. This would bridge the gap between how the GPL and Gauteng citizens define and measure performance.

CONCLUSIONS

It was found that effectiveness in the GPL is mainly understood at operational level. It can be concluded that the GPL subscribes to the performance model which defines effectiveness in terms of having the required inputs and outputs. Regarding the actual performance, from an internal perspective, it was found that the GPL has been performing relatively well, achieving not less than half of the targets in any given financial year for the period of the study. However, suboptimal performance has been recorded from an external perspective. It can be concluded that two effectiveness theories are currently in use in the GPL. On the one hand, from an internal perspective, the GPL assesses its effectiveness using the performance model. On the other hand, the people of Gauteng use the expectation disconfirmation model (outcomes) in assessing the performance of the GPL. There is a disjuncture between performance reported from an internal and external perspective. According to Wessels (2008 in Cameron 2013:578) the study of Public Administration should assist in solving practical public sector problems and contribute to meeting academic knowledge development needs. This study contributed to both. In terms of solving practical public sector problems, which include poor performance of the GPL as perceived by the citizens, the study managed to shed some light in terms of what practitioners need to focus on to improve perceived performance. The study revealed that practitioners need to seriously consider the expectations of the people as opposed to just focusing on operational matters. The study likewise contributed to meeting the academic knowledge needs in the field of Public Administration. This was achieved by closing a knowledge gap of how and why performance from an internal and external perspective differs. The study revealed that from an internal perspective, the GPL uses the performance model while the citizens view effectiveness using the expectation disconfirmation model. Moreover, the study demonstrated the applicability of these theories to the GPL. According to Nieuwenhuis (2010:112) the process of bringing analysed data into context with current theory or revealing how it verifies existing knowledge or brings new understandings, constitutes the researcher’s exceptional contribution to the development of science or knowledge. Thus, this study made a seminal contribution to knowledge in the field of Public Administration. In conclusion, DeHoog, Lowery and Lyons (1990:807) and Mangai (2016:93) argue that there are four models that can be used to explain why citizens may be pleased or displeased with government service. This article focused on two of the models, namely the performance, and the expectation disconfirmation. The role played by the individual and jurisdictional models in determining satisfaction of citizens was not explored in this article.
