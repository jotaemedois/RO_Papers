The level of trust citizens have in their political system has been the object of extensive

academic and public debate. The dominant view is that contemporary democracies are

experiencing a large-scale crisis of confidence. In 2008, only 30 per cent of the Americans

trusted their government, while this was more than 60 per cent in the sixties (American

National Election Studies 1958-2008)i. However, a number of studies have provided evidence

that does not support, and which even contradicts this pessimistic proposition (Klingemann

and Fuchs 1995; Van de Walle et al. 2008; Hooghe and Wilkenfeld 2008). In effect, while

there is evidence of a structural trend towards lower political trust since the 1960s in the

United States, there exists no conclusive evidence of a general decline in political trust in

Europe (Lipset and Scheinder 1983; Catterberg and Moreno 2003; Van de Walle et al. 2008).

Besides the distinct cross-national trends, the inconsistent findings are also often due to the

operationalisation of political trust. A range of measurements have been used, including

support for particular policies, evaluations of the politicians in office, trust in political

institutions and trust in the political system.

Citizens’ trust can relate to distinct objects of the political system: its current authorities, the

political institutions, the values and principles or the political community (Easton 1965b;

Dalton 2004). In empirical research, this issue is often not taken into account: trust in one

object is measured and labelled ‘political trust’ or one measure includes trust in several

objects. Nonetheless, distrust in the political system has different implications than distrust in

the politicians in office (Anderson et al. 2005). A critical attitude towards the politicians in

office is generally considered to be a normal and healthy part of a democracy. Citizens can

easily ‘throw the rascals out’ and replace them with politicians they perceive trustworthy by

means of elections (Klingemann and Fuchs 1995, 2-5; Anderson et al. 2005). However,

citizens should be able to put (some) trust in the democratic procedures and institutions. This

kind of trust, which relates to Easton’s concept of diffuse support, acts as a reservoir of

support on which a system can fall back when specific support for a particular policy measure

or prime minister is lacking (Easton 1965b). Moreover, it has been argued that trust in the

democratic procedures and institutions also influences the willingness of citizens to commit

public resources to public policy ends, to accept and comply with political decisions and to

engage in politics (Hetherington 2005; Dalton 2004; Marien and Hooghe 2011).

The nature of trust in political institutions has also been the topic of debate. Institutional trust

has been conceptualised and studied as both a one-dimensional and a multidimensional

attitude. On the one hand it has been argued that citizens use different criteria to evaluate the

trustworthiness of different institutions (Fisher et al. 2010; Hibbing and Theiss-Morse 1995).

As citizens develop distinct trust judgements, one should not simply add these different trust

judgments into one measurement scale. On the other hand institutions do not operate in a

vacuum but they are all part of a political system with a particular prevailing political culture

(Almond and Verba 1963). As a result, we could expect that citizens develop one

comprehensive attitude ‘trust in political institutions’ which is shaped by the political culture

of their country.

Our understanding of political trust is shaped to a large extent by research conducted on the

United States. Comparative research has confirmed, but also modified these research results

(Bélanger and Nadeau 2005). Cross-national research has enabled researchers to investigate

the generalisability of trends and theories. However, this kind of research entails

methodological problems we do not encounter in single country studies. In particular, cultural

differences in the interpretations of questions or words can emerge. Trust in the political

system in an authoritarian country is likely to have a different meaning than trust in a

democratic political system. But even among democracies, every country has its own

language, culture and political system. While this can invalidate research results - apples are

compared to oranges - most scholars ignore these problems.

In this chapter, I will address several problems related to the measurement of political trust.

The chapter begins with a description of frequently used measurements of political trust and

the problems with these. In the second section, the nature of institutional trust is investigated.

Do citizens have one comprehensive attitude towards all political institutions or is

institutional trust multidimensional? Subsequently, the issue of cross-cultural equivalence is

addressed, i.e. I test whether trust in political institutions can be measured in a similar way

across different countries. Subsequently, an overview of levels of trust in different political

institutions is provided. Finally, recent trends in trust in political institutions and trust in the

current government are presented.

Measuring political trust

A frequently used data source to analyse political trust is the American National Elections

Studies. This study has questioned respondents’ political trust from the 1960s to the present

day. The questions are paraphrased here: do you think you can trust the government in

Washington to do what is right; does the government waste a lot of money; is the government

run by a few big interests looking out for themselves; are most politicians crooked; do

politicians know what they are doing? However, the validity of these questions was already

being criticised in 1974. Particularly noteworthy is the discussion between Arthur Miller and

Jack Citrin in the American Political Sciences Review of 1974. Using ANES data, Arthur

Miller argued that trust in the political system decreased sharply during the past years, Citrin

refuted this conclusion arguing that Miller was measuring trust in the current incumbents

rather than trust in the political system (Citrin 1974; Miller 1974). At present, there is still

substantial debate on the trends in political trust, its causes and consequences due to

disagreement about the measurement of political trust. Pippa Norris (1999), for example,

states that the extensive literature on decreasing political trust is based on an erroneous

interpretation of the data at hand.

Besides these five ANES questions, scholars have also attempted to measure citizens’

political trust by asking respondents how satisfied they are ‘with the way democracy is

working in [their country]’. Political trust is often measured using this wording of the

question, especially in European empirical studies (e.g. in the Eurobarometer surveys, the

European Value Studies and the European Social Survey). However, this measurement also

conflates trust in the current authorities and trust in the principles of a political system. It is

not clear whether this survey question taps a more generalised political trust judgment, a more

specific judgment of the trustworthiness of the politicians in office or a respondent’s state of

mind at the moment. Still other empirical work studies political trust by focusing on citizens’

trust in different political institutions. Citizens are asked how much they trust their country’s

parliament, government, political parties, the legal system, the police and so forth. Although

this question is designed to tap into a more generalised form of political trust, this

measurement also cannot rule out what respondents think about the people running these

institutions when answering this question.

However, we can question whether it is possible at all to fully disentangle trust in the current

authorities and trust in the political system and its institutions using survey questions. Some

scholars state that a ‘referent’ is needed to obtain a valid measurement (Aberbach 1969). It is

argued that citizens cannot assess the trustworthiness of political institutions without thinking

about its current incumbents. Moreover, both forms of trust are clearly related. Citizens that

have no trust at all in the political system will also distrust the current incumbents, and strong

distrust in the politicians in office can spill over to trust evaluations of the institutions and the

political system. This last measurement focuses on one part of the broader concept of political

trust, i.e. trust in the political institutions. It does not assess trust in the political system as a

whole. Nor does it assess trust in the democratic principles or values, nor in particular

political leaders. The advantage of studying trust in one specific part of the political system is

that it is clear what is being measured. The drawback is that only one part of the broader

concept of political trust is measured. However, as political institutions play an important role

in shaping a democratic society, we can assume that citizens’ trust in these institutions is

strongly related to citizens’ evaluation of how they perceive a political system is performing.

Therefore, trust in political institutions is the focus of this chapter. Apart from these

theoretical reasons, data on trust in political institutions in more than 30 European countries is

available in the ESS datasets. In this chapter, I will not study citizens’ trust in the principles or

values of a democracy. The latter is (and remains) at a very high level within democracies.

Democracy is considered among the overall majority of its citizens as the best system to

govern a society (Klingemann 1999, 45). Whether these democratic principles and values are

upheld in a democracy is an interesting question, but beyond the scope of this study. Trust in

individual politicians, such as the current ministers or party leaders, is also interesting to

investigate, but will not be my main focus, as distrust in the current authorities is generally

considered to be a normal practice in a democracy. Nevertheless, some figures on satisfaction

with the current government in several European countries will be presented at the end of the

chapter.

The results of the European Social Survey datasets 2002-2009 will be presented (Jowell et al.

2003, 2005, 2007, 2009). These datasets provide extensive and up-to-date information on trust

in political institutions and, to date, four waves of high-quality survey data are already

available. The data were collected biannually between 2002 and 2009 by means of uniform

face-to-face interviews among representative samples of the population of more than 30

European countries. Particular attention has been paid to the operationalisation of political

trust, and a measurement report by the ESS researchers on the quality of the ‘trust in political

institutions’ already reveals that the question has a high level of validity and reliabilityii. The

question on trust in political institutions used in ESS is phrased as follows:

‘Using this card, please tell me on a score of 0-10 how much you personally trust each of the

institutions I read out. 0 means you do not trust an institution at all, and 10 means you have

complete trust’

- Country’s Parliament

- The legal system

- The police

- Political parties (from second ESS wave onwards)

- Politicians

Trust in political institutions: one theoretical concept?

Institutional trust can be defined as the expectation that political institutions operate according

to fair rules even in the absence of constant scrutiny. Trust in political institutions has been

studied as a one-dimensional as well as a multidimensional concept. On the one hand, it has

been argued that citizens use different criteria to evaluate the trustworthiness of different

institutions (Fisher et al. 2010). As citizens develop distinct trust judgements, one should not

simply add these different trust judgments into one scale of measurement. On the other hand,

institutions do not operate in a vacuum; they are all part of a political system with a particular

political culture (Almond & Verba 1963). As a result, we can expect that citizens’ judgements

of the performance of various political institutions are strongly related to each other (Hooghe

forthcoming). Consequently, citizens are likely to develop one comprehensive attitude of

‘trust in political institutions’, which is shaped by the political culture of their country. This

general attitude influences their judgment of the trustworthiness of various institutions. By

means of factor analysis, it is tested whether one underlying construct of ‘institutional trust’

exists which explains a set of trust judgments. This underlying construct cannot be observed

directly - as with all latent variables - but its existence is inferred from the way it influences

variables that can be observed (Brown 2006).

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) explores the variation and co-variation among the trust

judgements of the different political institutions and identifies the number and nature of latent

variable(s) that account for this variation (Brown 2006). I hypothesise that citizens’ trust in

political institutions is shaped by their general orientation towards the political system.

Consequently, a one-factor measurement model is tested, whereby the observed measures of

trust in the country’s parliament, trust in the political parties, trust in the legal system, trust in

the police and trust in politicians are conjectured to load on one latent factor, i.e. ‘trust in

political institutions’. The measurement model was estimated using the maximum likelihood

method. Not all institutions were questioned in the first wave of ESS (2002-2003), therefore,

the analyses were only performed on wave 2 (2004-2005), wave 3 (2006-2007) and wave 4

(2008-2009)iii. Given that the results are very similar, only the results of the last wave are

discussed in this section. The results of the other waves can be found in the appendix to this

chapter.

After specifying the measurement model, the model is estimated and evaluated. To evaluate

the fitted CFA solution, one has to study the overall goodness of fit, analyse specific points of

ill-fit and look into the direction, magnitude and significance of the parameters. Several tests

have been developed to evaluate whether the model provides a good description of the data.

The indices of fit that I will use are the χ2, RMSEA and CFI. I will report the χ2 of the model

as this is a classic goodness-of-fit measure. However, given the large sample that is used in

the analyses, χ2 is a poor measure as it generally rejects solutions based on a large n (Brown

2006; Reeskens & Hooghe 2008, 523). A better measure, and which is widely used, is the

Root Square Mean approximation (RMSEA) as ‘it assesses the extent to which a model fits

reasonably well in the population (as opposed to testing whether the model holds exactly in

the population; cf. χ2)’ (Brown 2006, 83). A reasonably good fit is operationalised as a

RMSEA close to 0.06 or below (Hu & Bentler 1999). Finally, the Comparative Fit Index

(CFI) will be used to evaluate the fitted CFA solution. The CFI ranges between 0 and 1. A

reasonably good fit is operationalised by values that are close to 0.95 or greater. These cut-off

criteria are reported by Brown (2006) based on several simulation studies of Hu and Bentler

(1999).

The results of the Confirmatory Factor Analysis are visualised in Figure 1. The goodness-of fit measures indicate that the estimated model provides a good approximation to reality.

Institutional trust can be conceptualised as a one-dimensional attitude. The factor loadings

reproduce the relation between institutional trust and the different trust judgments. A factor

loading of ‘1’ indicates a perfect relationship, while a value of ‘0’ depicts that there is no

relationship between the observed measure and the latent concept. Besides the variance

accounted for by the latent concept, every measure also has its unique variance, which is

labelled as the error variance. In table 1 additional estimates of the parameters of the

confirmatory factor analysis are reported. The test statistic tests whether there is a relationship

between latent concept and observed measure, i.e. whether the factor loading is significantly

different from ‘0’. The last column of table 1 includes estimates of the explained variance of

the observed measure, which can be considered as an indicator for its reliability. For instance,

80 per cent of the variance in trust in parliament can be accounted for by respondents’

institutional trust. The remaining 20 per cent cannot be explained by institutional trust, but is

‘unique variance’.

We can conclude that all items contribute significantly to the measurement of this latent

concept. In effect, every factor loading is clearly above 0.30, i.e. the value that is commonly

used to define a ‘salient’ factor loading (Brown 2006, 130). The contribution of trust in the

police to the measurement of institutional trust is slightly smaller. In general, the factor

loadings of the observed measures of trust in implementing institutions are lower than the

factor loadings of trust in the institutions on the representational side of the political system.

In summary, the measurement model indicates that all observed measures are intercorrelated

because they are influenced by the same underlying construct, i.e. ‘trust in political

institutions’. For instance, trust in police is related to trust in parliament because they are both

influenced by respondents’ general attitude of ‘trust in political institutions’.

However, there is some covariance between the two implementing institutions, the police and

the legal system, due to sources other than this general attitude of ‘trust in political

institutions’. Therefore, the errors of these two measures are allowed to correlate. The police

and the legal system are primarily responsible for the maintenance of order, and we can

assume, in line with Inglehart’s postmodernisation theory (1999), that citizens have a different

opinion towards these order institutions than towards representational institutions. Likewise,

citizens hold different expectations towards implementing and representational institutions.

While political parties, the parliament and politicians are expected to be partisan,

implementing institutions are expected to be impartial (Rothstein & Stolle 2008). However,

we should note that this is not always the case; for instance, the legal system is more

politicised in the United States - e.g. judges are politically appointed and their party

preference is often well known. Given these theoretical arguments and the covariance

between these two measures, it can be useful, depending on the research question, to make a

distinction between implementing institutions and institutions on the representational side of

the political system.

Furthermore, a preliminary analysis showed that trust in politicians and trust in political

parties also share variance that cannot be explained by the latent concept. Allowing an error

correlation between these two items increases the fit of the model. At first sight, this

correlation is less clear than the error correlation between trust in the legal system and trust in

the police. We can speculate that this shared variance could be because respondents perceive

political parties, and especially politicians, as less of an ‘institution’ than parliament, the legal

system or the police. The assessment of trust in politicians and political parties might be

influenced more strongly by the performance of the current incumbents than respondents’

trust in parliament, the legal system or the police. In addition, politicians are routinely

members of a political party. The mean value of, and the variance in, trust in political parties

and trust in politicians are indeed very similar, which could indicate that citizens do not make

a distinction between political parties and politicians.

A one-factor measurement model was also fitted to the survey data from ESS (2006-2007)

and ESS (2004-2005). Similar results emerged from these analyses (see appendix). We can

conclude that institutional trust can be conceptualised as a one-dimensional attitude. Citizens

have one generalised attitude which influences their trust evaluations of specific political

institutions.

So far the country-level context was not taken into account in the analysis. However, cross national comparisons entail methodological challenges which should be addressed. In

particular, cultural differences in the interpretations of questions or words can emerge. The

European Social Survey pays particular attention to ensure an optimal comparability with

regard to the operationalisation and cross-cultural validity of concepts in the participating

countries. Nonetheless, even if all questions are translated adequately and the same method of

data gathering is used, it is still possible that respondents with a different cultural background

10

will react differently to the same measures. Using Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis

(MGCFA), it is investigated whether the general model that was developed holds true in all

countries under study. In more technical terms, I test for the ‘cross-cultural equivalence’ of

the ‘institutional trust’ scale. In particular, I test whether the same factor structure emerges in

all countries iv.

A Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis on ESS (2008-2009) reveals a similar factor

structure across the 22 countries. The fit indices indicate that the CFA solution has a

reasonably good fit. In all countries, the five measures contribute significantly to the

measurement of trust in political institutions. Trust in the police has the weakest contribution

to the measurement of institutional trust in all countries, but the factor loading is still largely

above the minimum requirement of 0.30v. In summary, the same pattern of factor loadings is

found across the different countries. It is thereby possible to discuss institutional trust

meaningfully in all countries. This kind of equivalence is labelled ‘configural equivalence’.

Nevertheless, the magnitude of the factor loadings can differ across the different countries,

which can make cross-country comparisons problematic. In a next step, it is tested whether

the factor loadings are the same across the countries. Put another way, is the relationship

between the five measures and the latent concept the same in all countries? Only if this is the

case, can one unit increase in the ‘trust in political institutions’ scale in country X be

compared to one unit increase in the ‘trust in political institutions’ scale in country Y. In order

to test this, the factor loadings are constrained to be equal across the different countries. This

test is called ‘metric equivalence’ and is a stricter test of cross-cultural equivalence (Brown

2006).

The factor loading of some observed measures deviates from the general pattern in a number

of countries. For instance, in Bulgaria, trust in the police has a stronger connection to

institutional trust than in other countries. Put another way, the factor loadings do not

reproduce the relationship between observed measure and latent concept well in all countries.

The imposed constraints on the measurement model worsen the fit of the model to the data

(Table 2). In practice, full metric equivalence is often considered to be unrealistic (Byrne et

al. 1989). Therefore, partial metric equality has been proposed as an alternative, which entails

that at least two items of the construct possess measurement equivalence characteristics

(Byrne et al. 1989). Some imposed constraints can be removed in order to improve the

measurement model. One has to look at the nature of the constraint, the Modification Index

11

(MI) and the Expected Parameter Change (EPC) in order to decide whether to relax a

constraint. This is an iterative process. The constraint with the highest Modification Index and

a substantial Expected Parameter Change is removed. Subsequently, the model fit is re evaluated. This procedure is repeated until an additional modification does not make a

substantial difference.

Table 2 shows the modifications that have been implemented in order to arrive at a better

model. First, we removed the constraint on the factor loading of trust in the police in Bulgaria.

This factor loading was constrained to equal 0.619; however, the connection between

institutional trust and trust in the police is stronger in Bulgaria (Factor loading POLICEBG =

0.851). A one-unit increase in institutional trust in Bulgaria is associated with an increase in

trust in the police of 0.851 units. By removing the equality constraint for trust in the police in

Bulgaria, i.e. the factor loading can now be freely estimated, the model fit improves

substantially: the χ2 drops with more than 100 points, the RMSEA decreases from 0.068 to

0.065 and the CFI increases from 0.98 to 0.99. The equality constraints on the factor loadings

of trust in the police and trust in the legal system in Finland are also removed. The connection

between institutional trust and trust in the police and the legal system is weaker in Finland

than in other countries (see the negative signs of the EPC estimates). In effect, a one-unit

increase in institutional trust in Finland is associated with an increase in trust in the police of

0.462 units. Most of the modifications concern trust in the implementing institutions. In

general, we observe that the connection between institutional trust and trust in the police and

the legal system is stronger in the newer democracies than it is in established democracies.

Overall, the connection between institutional trust and trust in parliament is rather strong. In

Spain and Slovakia, however, the connection between institutional trust and trust in

parliament is weaker than in other countries. Removing some of the equality constraints, the

model demonstrates a good fit of the data (CFI = 0.993; RMSEA = 0.058). The final model is

shown in Figure 2.

Some constraints were removed (see table 2). Fit indices: χ2 = 1019.571; df = 143. RMSEA = 0.058; CFI = 0.993; n = 39,764. The same analyses were performed on ESS 2006-2007 and ESS 2004-2005 (see Appendix).

These analyses show that there is indeed a similar configuration of factor loadings across the

different countries. In all countries, trust in the police has the lowest factor loading and thus

the weakest relationship to institutional trust. As regards the tests for metric equivalence,

some of the equality constraints also needed to be removed from ESS 2006-2007 and ESS

2004-2005 to obtain a better measurement model. We can observe a pattern in the applied

modifications; the factor loadings of trust in implementing institutions are lower in the Nordic

countries than in the other countries. In the newer democracies (Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia),

the factor loadings of trust in implementing institutions are higher than in the other countries.

The measurement models based on ESS 2006-2007 and ESS 2004-2005 have a slightly better

fit than the model based on ESS 2008-2009 presented here.

From the analyses we can conclude that the ‘institutional trust’ scale is configural equivalent:

a similar pattern of factor loadings emerged. Therefore, institutional trust can be meaningfully

discussed in the different countries. The factor loadings are not entirely the same in all

countries. In general, institutional trust has a stronger connection to trust in implementing

13

institutions in new democracies than in more established democracies. It seems that citizens’

expectations towards representing and implementing institutions differ more in established

democracies. As stated already, implementing institutions are expected to be impartial, while

representing institutions are expected to be partisan. It might be that citizens in newer

democracies do not perceive implementing institutions as impartial but rather as political, and

even as corrupt, as their representing institutions. This could offer an explanation for the

stronger connection between the different trust judgements in new democracies. Therefore,

some of the equality constraints had to be removed. After these modifications, the constrained

model provides a good fit of the datavi.

Trends in political trust From the previous analyses, we can conclude that trust in political institutions can be analysed

as a one-dimensional latent concept across different countries. A second part provides an

overview of recent (trends in) political trust figures in Europe. First, citizens’ trust in a

number of political institutions is described. Subsequently, recent trends in institutional trust

and government support in Europe are outlined.

Table 3 includes citizens’ trust evaluations of a number of institutions between 2002 and

2009vii. The same patterns emerge in all waves of the European Social Survey: respondents’

trust in implementing institutions is significantly higher than in representational institutions.

Moreover, the difference proves to be significant in all countries under study viii. Political

parties and politicians in particular receive low trust scores. Between 2002 and 2009, 10 to 15

per cent of the respondents indicated that they do not trust politicians and political parties at

all (a value of ‘0’ on an 11-point scale). Conversely, less than 8 per cent answered that they

had no trust at all in the legal system, and less than 5 per cent indicated that they had no trust

at all in the police. Table 3 also includes information on citizens’ trust in two international

institutions - the European Parliament and the United Nations. Trust in international

institutions was not taken into account in the previous analysis, given that not all countries are

a member of the European Union, which makes it difficult to compare the countries on this

trust measure. Moreover, scholars are generally interested in determinants and consequences

of trust in national political institutions.

International institutions enjoy more trust than most national institutions. Citizens have more

trust in the European Parliament than in their national political parties or politicians.

Moreover, respondents in half of the countries have more trust in the European Parliament

than in their national parliament. Trust in the United Nations is also remarkably high.

Particularly in new democracies, international institutions receive higher trust values than the

national institutions. We can assume that most citizens do not have any direct contact with

these international institutions and do not know much about them. In effect, fewer

respondents are able to evaluate the trustworthiness of international than national institutions.

In every wave of the European Social Survey, between 10 and 15 per cent of the respondents

indicated that they do not know whether to trust or distrust the European Parliament or the

United Nations. On the other hand, less than 4 per cent of the respondents do not know

whether to trust or distrust their national institutions. Almost all respondents - 98 per cent have an opinion on the trustworthiness of the police, which is the institution with which

respondents were most likely to have come into contact. The number of missing values is

even larger in new democracies.

Self-evidently, it is important to distinguish countries that are not a member of the European

Union. In effect, a larger number of respondents in Switzerland and Norway are not able to

form an opinion on the trustworthiness of the European Parliament. Thirteen per cent of the

Norwegian respondents do not have an opinion on the trustworthiness of the European

Parliament, while this is less than one per cent for the Norwegian Parliament. However, also

in EU-member countries the number of respondents that is unable to judge the trustworthiness

of the European Parliament is substantial (especially compared to their own national

parliament). In 2008, almost a fifth of the Spanish and Portuguese respondents indicated that

they do not know whether to trust the European Parliament or not.

These figures conceal substantial differences in trust levels between the different countries. In

the subsequent paragraphs, recent trends in political trust in Europe will be described per

country. While political trust has strongly declined in the United States since the 1980s

(Lipset & Schneinder 1983; Hetherington 2005), such a declining trend was not found in

Europe (Klingeman & Fuchs 1995). Recent trends in institutional trust and satisfaction with

the current government in Europe are described using the four available waves of the

European Social Survey. Only the 23 countries which participated more than twice in the

survey will be analysed ix. Unfortunately, trust in political parties was not questioned in the

first wave of the survey, therefore this measure was not included in the ‘trust in political

institutions’ scale. The latter includes trust in the country’s national parliament, the legal

system, the police and politicians. The four items were added into one scale, and for reasons

of clarity, this scale was recoded to range between 0 and 10.

Trust levels are represented by region in order to gain a clear overview of the trends. Looking

at the established democracies, the most striking observation is the stability in levels of

institutional trust (Figures 3-5). The general pattern is quite common in research on political

culture, with the highest values documented in Northern Europe, while the countries in

Southern and Eastern Europe tend to have lower levels of trust. In Figure 3, institutional trust

in the Nordic countries is shown. In general, the changes in institutional trust are small in

these countries: on average, a change of 0.13 on an 11-point scale. The most substantial

changes in institutional trust are documented in Norway and Sweden. In Sweden, institutional

trust decreased from 5.88 to 5.45 between 2002 and 2004. In the following years, however,

trust increased again to its 2002 levels. While institutional trust was found to be in decline in

Sweden during the 1980s and 1990s (Holmberg 1999), no such general declining trend can be

observed in the 2000s. Institutional trust in Norway decreased between 2002 and 2004, to

increase again to its 2002 level in 2006. In Finland, there is a small significant increase in

institutional trust from 6.3 to 6.4 between 2002 and 2004. In Denmark, none of the changes in

institutional trust between 2002 and 2009 are significant. In summary, the changes in

institutional trust are modest in the Nordic countries and might even be due to sample

differences.

Levels of institutional trust are less stable in Southern Europe (Figure 4). On average, the

changes in institutional trust amount to 0.4 on an 11-point scale. In Greece, in particular,

institutional trust decreased significantly from 5.2 in 2002 to 3.9 in 2008. In Portugal too,

trust in institutions decreased from 4.2 in 2002 to 3.8 in 2008. Spain, the third Southern

European country that was questioned multiple times, can be also found at the bottom of the

graph. In Spain, trust in political institutions amounted to 4.5 in 2002 and increased slightly in

recent years to 4.9 in 2004 and 4.7 in 2008.

Next to Sweden, political trust levels were also found to be in decline in the Netherlands.

Several scholars reported a strong decline in institutional trust in the Netherlands at the

beginning of the 21st century (Bovens & Wille 2008; Hendriks 2009). Figure 5 also reveals

that this decline did not persist as institutional trust increased significantly in the Netherlands

during the 2000s (from 5.3 in 2002 to 5.8 in 2009). In several countries, after an increase or

decrease in trust, trust levels are restored to the original level in the following years. In effect,

it is argued that public opinion has become more volatile as a result of different trends such as

party dealignment, better informed citizens and a more sensation-seeking media (Bovens &

Wille 2009). However, the variations in levels of institutional trust in established democracies

are small (e.g. an average change of 0.1 on an 11-point scale for the countries in Figure 5).

Trust levels remain relatively high in the Nordic countries, while trust levels in Southern

Europe remain at a lower level. In general, the levels of trust in political institutions are also

more volatile in the newer democracies in Southern Europe than in the longer established

Northern European democracies.

A clearly different pattern emerges in the newer democracies in Eastern Europe (Figure 6).

Firstly, trust levels are still substantially lower than in the established democracies. Estonia is

characterised by the highest trust levels among the newer democracies, with an average score

of 4.5/10 - which is still substantially below the average trust values in Western Europe. The

lowest trust level is found in Ukraine, with an average value of 1.8 in 2008. Put another way,

26.5 per cent of the Ukrainian respondents indicated that they had no trust at all in any of the

four institutions (parliament, legal system, the police or politicians) x. Secondly, trust levels in

new democracies are clearly more volatile than in more established democracies. We can

observe significant decreases in trust levels in Hungary and Ukraine. In only six years, trust in

political institutions declined almost two points on the 11-point trust scale in both countries

(i.e. from 4.7 to 3.1 in Hungary and from 3.9 to 1.8 in Ukraine). On the other hand, trust

levels increased in Slovenia and Slovakia (especially between 2004 and 2006). In Poland and

the Czech Republic, we see that trust levels restored to the original levels after a significant

drop in trust between 2002 and 2004.

We can conclude that citizens’ trust in political institutions in Europe has been stable over the

past years. Institutional trust even increased in countries in which a general downward trend

was documented during the 1990s or early 2000s. The analysis of trends in institutional trust

in 23 European countries reveals that after a decrease or increase in trust, trust levels restore

to their original levels in the following years. In newer democracies, institutional trust proved

to be more volatile than in more established democracies. In Hungary and Ukraine in

particular, substantial drops in institutional trust were documented during the 2000s.

Institutional trust also decreased sharply in Greece during the period. However, in line with

the trends in institutional trust that were reported in Sweden and the Netherlands, we can

expect that institutional trust will increase again in these countries in the following years.

These findings confirm Klingemann and Fuchs’s (1995) conclusion that there is no general

declining trend in political trust in Europe. However, it also implies that levels of political

trust in newer democracies remain rather low, and there are very few indications that levels of

trust in these countries will rise substantially in the years ahead.

In the next paragraphs, we will look into the trends in a more specific kind of political trust:

satisfaction with the current government. Respondents were asked ‘Now thinking about the

[country] government, how satisfied are you with the way it is doing its job?’ A value of 0

indicated that they were extremely dissatisfied, while a value of 10 indicated that they were

extremely satisfied. In 2008-2009, the average level of satisfaction with government

amounted to 4.42/10 in established democracies and 3.19/10 in newer democracies (F =

2,316.922; p < 0.000). The cross-national patterns in this specific trust judgement are similar

to the ones we observed in the more generalised institutional trust. But as we could expect

from Easton’s theory (1965), satisfaction with the current government is more volatile than

trust in political institutions. In terms of government satisfaction, the Nordic countries are also

at the top of the list, together with Switzerland and Luxembourg (Figures 7-9). While

satisfaction with government fluctuates more than institutional trust in Scandinavia, the

fluctuations are rather modest, especially in comparison to the evolution of satisfaction with

government in Southern and Eastern European countries (Figure 8 and Figure 10).

performing than in the Nordic countries. However, in 2005, satisfaction with government was

remarkably high in Spain and Greece, surpassing the satisfaction levels of their counterparts

in Norway and the Netherlands. Government satisfaction significantly increased in both

countries between 2002 and 2005. The increase in government satisfaction seems to follow

the economic growth that Spain experienced during the 2000s. In effect, previous research has

revealed that the economic situation is an important predictor for government support

(Lockerbie 1993). Government support can also suddenly increase due to a dramatic event,

which is called ‘rally around the flag’ in the literature (Hetherington & Nelson 2003; Gross et

al. 2009). The terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 could have led to such a rally

around the flag effect. The graphs indeed show a strong increase in satisfaction with

government in Spain between 2002 and 2005 (from 4.3 in 2002 to 5.1 in 2005). In Greece, the

alternation of the parties in office in 2004 and the organisation of the Olympic Games might

offer an explanation for these high levels of government satisfaction in 2005.

However, in the second half of the 2000s, satisfaction with Greek government dramatically

declined from 4.1 in 2002 to 2.7 in 2008. A quarter of the respondents indicated that they

were extremely dissatisfied with their current government. Greece was confronted with an

avalanche of political scandals in these years. Moreover, the government’s plans to reform

university regulation evoked several strikes and protests. The way in which the government

handled severe forest fires also created the public perception of an incompetent, ineffective

government. The general elections of 2007 revealed a widespread dissatisfaction with an

increase in abstention of 2.6 per cent and a substantial increase in protest votes for three minor

political parties (Mavrogordatos 2008). At the end of 2008, the Greek government was

confronted with the worst riots and unrest since the military dictatorship in 1974. The

government failed to restore order promptly and the riots persisted for several weeks

(Mavrogordatos 2009). Given the 2010 debt crisis and unrest, this declining trend in

government satisfaction is likely to persist. Satisfaction with government also proves to be

volatile in Portugal. In the beginning of the 2000s, satisfaction with government decreased.

Portuguese politics was characterised by a series of scandals which led to numerous

government reshuffles. In addition, the country was confronted with an economic recession

and the government introduced severe austerity policies in public spending. However, by the

mid-2000s, satisfaction with government increased gradually to its 2002 levels. At that time,

the economic situation also slightly improved and the centre-right government was voted out

of office and replaced by a new (socialist) government (Magone 2005).

Source: ESS 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008. Notes: The means of citizens’ ‘satisfaction with government’ are presented. The scale ranges from 0 to 10.

Satisfaction with government has also declined significantly in the United Kingdom and

Belgium during the past decade. In the United Kingdom, satisfaction with the Labour

government gradually declined during the 2000s (Figure 9). Satisfaction with government

amounted to 4.38 in 2002 and dropped to 4.05 in 2006. In 2008, the average level of

satisfaction with government only amounted to 3.60. Even the Labour voters were not

satisfied with government in 2008, with an average level of satisfaction of 4.44. This might

offer an explanation as to why the government could not secure re-election in the 2010

general elections. The next wave of ESS will show whether the alternation of power was able

to reverse this declining trend in government satisfaction. In Belgium, satisfaction with the

government reached its lowest level in the past decade (Figure 9). The political and economic

crisis seems to have exerted a strong effect on specific political support in Belgium.

Satisfaction with government decreased from 5.18 in 2002 to 3.92 in 2008. However, these

events do not seem to affect the more generalised kind of political trust, given the remarkable

stability of trust in political institutions in Belgium we observed in Figure 5.

On the other hand, satisfaction with the current government has increased in the Netherlands.

Previous research has documented a steep decline in satisfaction with government in the

Netherlands at the start of the century. While approximately two-thirds of the respondents in

1998 thought the Dutch government was doing a good job, less than a third of the respondents

were satisfied with government at the beginning of the century (Bovens & Wille 2008). The

ESS data show that this drop was only temporary; satisfaction with government was gradually

restored from 4.24 in 2002 to 4.45 in 2004 to 5.44 in 2006, and eventually to 5.53 in 2008.

Governments in Switzerland and Germany also received more support in 2008 than they did

in 2002, but these increases are rather modest.

Source: ESS 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008. Notes: The means of citizens’ ‘satisfaction with government’ are presented. The scale ranges from 0 to 10.

Finally, the new democracies in Eastern Europe are characterised by substantial volatility in

government satisfaction. In effect, only few governments in Central and Eastern European

countries are able to secure re-election (Tavits 2005). Figure 10 shows a steep decline in

government satisfaction in Hungary in the past decade. Satisfaction with the current

government declined by three points on an 11- point scale (i.e. from 4.88 (2002) to 3.23

(2004) to 2.68 (2006) to 1.88 (2008)). In 2008, 37.4 per cent of the respondents in Hungary

indicated that they were extremely dissatisfied with their government (i.e. value 0/10).

Category 0 and 1 together include more than half of the Hungarian respondents. Figure 6

already showed that institutional trust also declined in recent years in Hungary. Ukrainian

governments are also confronted with declining levels of government satisfaction. At the

beginning of 2005, in the aftermath of the Orange Revolution, satisfaction with government

amounted to 4.25 only to drop to 2.17 at the end of 2006 and to drop even further to 1.53 in

2009. Put another way, in 2009, 42.4 per cent of the Ukrainian respondents answered that they

were extremely dissatisfied with their government. Three-fourths of the Ukrainian

respondents can be found in the lowest four categories. Decreasing levels of satisfaction with

government are also prevalent in the Czech Republic and Estonia, but to a more modest

extent. In Poland, satisfaction with government decreased between 2002 and 2004, but was

restored to its original level in 2008. On the other hand, in Slovenia and Slovakia, satisfaction

with the current government increased. In Slovakia, we see quite a substantial increase in

satisfaction with the current government from 3.0 in 2002 to 5.0 in 2004 to 4.8 in 2008.

We see that similar trends emerge in institutional trust and satisfaction with the current

government in some countries. While diffuse and specific trust have different determinants,

there is certainly a spill-over between these two political trust measures. For instance, a

corruption scandal can erode satisfaction with the current government as well as trust in the

political institutions. In Hungary and Ukraine, strong declines in institutional trust and

satisfaction with the current government were documented. On the other hand, the political

and economic crisis does not seem to affect trust in political institutions in Belgium, while it

strongly decreased satisfaction with the current government. Given that trust in the political

institutions is less stable in new democracies, it is possible that the evaluations of the current

government are more important for trust in political institutions in newer democracies than in

established democracies. However, the calculation of correlations between measures of

institutional trust and satisfaction with the current government show that the relation between

these two is similar in established and new democracies (resp. 0.602 p < 0.000 and 0.572 p <

0.000). This correlation differs between the countries under study with the weakest

association in Denmark (Pearson correlation = 0.333; p < 0.000) and Slovenia (Pearson

correlation = 0.388; p < 0.000) and the strongest correlation in the Netherlands (Pearson

correlation = 0.681; p < 0.000) and Bulgaria (Pearson correlation = 0.644; p < 0.000). But no

clear cross-national pattern emerges.

its citizens resulting in an unprecedented confidence crisis (Crozier et al. 1975; Nye 1997;

Dalton 2004; Macedo et al. 2005). In the mid–seventies, Crozier, Huntington and Watanuki

(1975, 159) for instance stated ‘Dissatisfaction with and lack of confidence in the functioning

of the institutions of democratic government have thus now become widespread in the

Trilateral countries.’ Thirdly, years later, Dalton (2004, 1) repeats a similar message:

‘Contemporary democracies are facing a challenge today. This challenge does not come from

enemies within or outside the nation; instead, the challenge comes from democracy’s own

citizens, who have grown distrustful of politicians, sceptical about democratic institutions,

and disillusioned about how the democratic process functions’.

However, the evidence presented in this chapter clearly contradicts the claim that

contemporary democracies are losing citizens’ support. In effect, no general declining trend

could be found in institutional trust among a wide variety of European countries in the past

decade. Only in Greece, Hungary and Ukraine institutional trust declined substantially in the

past decade. More recent data is needed to ascertain whether this declining trend will persist.

While institutional trust has decreased in some European countries during the nineties and

early 2000s (Klingemann 1999; Bovens & Wille 2008), this study also shows that institutional

trust was restored to its original levels in the 2000s in these countries. Therefore, to date the

only conclusion that can be drawn is that institutional trust is stable (especially in the more

established democracies). These findings underline the importance of a good

operationalisation of political trust and of the study of political trust beyond the United States.

Throughout this chapter, the most outspoken difference in institutional trust is between

established and new democracies. Not only is political trust lower in newer democracies, it is

also more volatile. Nevertheless, the analyses revealed that institutional trust in new

democracies could also be measured in a valid manner. A one-dimensional attitude,

institutional trust, exists in all countries under study providing strong support for the claim

that institutional trust reflects an assessment of the prevailing political culture in a country.

Institutional trust influences citizens’ trust judgments of a broad range of institutions. While

institutional trust influences trust in representative as well as implementing institutions, its

influence on implementing institutions is smaller in established democracies. In new

democracies, on the other hand, institutional trust influences representative and implementing

institutions to the same extent. Put another way, citizens are distrustful of all institutions and

hardly differentiate between (impartial) implementing and (partisan) representative

institutions. Most likely, all institutions are perceived as political or even as corrupt.

While this study makes the necessary differentiations to the pessimistic claims that have

repeatedly put forward, the results also show that citizens are rather critical towards political

institutions and their government. Especially in new democracies, political institutions and

leaders lack popular support. In Hungary, for example, 37.4 per cent of the respondents

indicated to be extremely dissatisfied with their government (i.e. value 0/10). More than half

of the Hungarian respondents gave their government a value of 0 or 1 on a scale from 0 to 10.

Given the high levels of corruption in several of these newer democracies, it could be argued

that low levels of trust in political institutions reflect an accurate assessment of the

trustworthiness of these institutions. In established democracies, citizens might be dissatisfied

with how their political system is performing, but they can have at least a reasonable

expectation not to meet corrupt officials on a day to day basis.

iii The analyses are limited to free democratic countries. The Freedom House Index (FHI) is a widely used

indicator to assess whether a country is democratic by looking at the amount of political and civil liberties in the

country. Several political and civil rights are lacking in some of the countries included in the European Social

Survey. The Freedom House indices range between 1 and 7, where 7 is the lowest level of freedom. Based on

this index in 2008, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Romania and Croatia were not included in the analyses - with

combined Freedom House indices (political plus civil rights) of respectively: 11, 6, 5, 4 and 4. Given that the

focus of this study is on European countries, Israel was also not included.

iv These countries include Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,

Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain,

Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom in ESS (2008-2009). Austria, Iceland, Ireland and Luxembourg

were included in previous waves of the European Social Survey (see Appendix). The distinction between Eastern

and Western Germany is still considered to be relevant in public opinion research (Zmerli and Newton, 2008).

Therefore, the analyses were also performed considering Eastern Germany and Western Germany as two distinct

countries. These analyses led to similar results.

v The measurement model was also performed on every country separately. This additional analysis showed that

the measurement model in Cyprus gives a poor description of the data. The different results for the trust

measurement may be caused by the conflict between the Greek and Turkish community in Cyprus. However, the

case of Cyprus falls beyond the scope of this study as it calls for an in-depth investigation. The subsequent

analyses were conducted twice: including and excluding Cyprus. The model fit was each time slightly better

when Cyprus was excluded from the analyses, but the same pattern emerged in both cases. Therefore, I decided

to keep Cyprus in the analyses.

vi Several additional tests for cross-cultural equivalence can be performed which constrain the factor intercept,

factor variances and error variances (see, e.g. Brown, 2006; Reeskens and Hooghe, 2008).

vii Note that a comparison of the evolution of trust levels is not possible using table 3, as different countries are

included in each wave.

viii A t test was conducted per country showing a significantly higher level of trust in implementing institutions

than in representational institutions in every country.

ix These countries include Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,

Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain,

Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. A trend line can be presented for Ukraine as it was

included in the last three waves of ESS (2004-2008). Note, however, that Ukraine is not a free democracy

according to Freedom House and the results should be read with caution.

x These results should be read with caution as cross-cultural equivalence tests show that institutional trust in

Ukraine is not comparable to the other countries. Several political and civil rights are lacking in Ukraine, and

therefore, it cannot be considered a free democracy, which makes comparisons with democracies difficult.
