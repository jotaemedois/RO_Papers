This article analyses the impact of socializing experiences on the political attitudes of youngsters. More specifically, our goal is to evaluate the impact of the Youth Parliament program on youngsters’ confidence levels in the Minas Gerais State Assembly (MGSA). The analysis focuses on the cognitive foundations of attitudes and results show a substantial increase in confidence levels in MGSA, an increase associated with the acquisition of information on the institution. It is asserted that the increase in confidence in MGSA represents and attitudinal “gain”. The study design involves quasi-experimental research on a non-random sample. We conducted two rounds of interviews in 2008, prior and subsequent to the program, with 335 participants (167 in the treatment group; and 168 in the control group).

Keywords: Political attitudes; Political knowledge; Political socialization; Civic education.

Introduction

T

his article assesses the impact of the Youth Parliament on political attitudes of

its participants, focusing on their confidence in the Minas Gerais State Assembly

in Brazil. We examine whether changes in attitudes have a cognitive basis, that is, whether

they are related to changes in political knowledge.

The Youth Parliament project is sponsored by Minas Gerais’s State Assembly

(MGSA) and the Catholic University of Minas Gerais for public and private school

students from Belo Horizonte.Students from these schools participate in a series

of activities (lectures, workshops, roundtables, legislative activities etc) during one

semester. At the end of the program, students convene on the house floor to vote on a

series of proposals, which are subsequently sent as a bill to MGSA. The project aims

to enhance high school students’ civic education “through activities that lead them to

better understand the organization of powers, especially the Legislative, and prepare

them for political participation as citizens”.1

The Youth Parliament (YP) is part of a broader initiative in institutional development

promoted by MGSA. Since the early 1990s, the state assembly has been conducting an

ambitious project of institutional innovation, which in addition to modernizing their

structure and increasing their technical staff’s level of professionalism, aims to foster local

communities’ participation in the legislative process and improve access to the institution.

For this purpose, the project includes debates, seminars and forums that eventually lead

to the introduction of a bill in the MGSA.

As we shall see, young people’s perceptions in regards to MGSA have changed, and

their confidence in same has increased, both as a result of participation in the YP. In the

absence of direct evidence, we suggest that the institutional environment of the innovative

MGSA has contributed to this change, particularly in a positive direction.

We argue that this increased confidence in the MGSA has a cognitive basis because

it is associated with information gained through frequent contact with the state legislature,

its employees, and representatives, as well as through participation in workshops on civic

education and legislative activities. The existence of a cognitive basis for attitudinal change

depends on whether the YP provides any cognitive gains to participants and whether those

gains can be associated with an increase in confidence in the MGSA.

Our research design follows the logic of quasi-experimental research (Campbelland

Stanley 1979). In 2008, a non-random sample of 670 participants2 completed two rounds

of interviews3, 335 before and 335 after the program. We interviewed 167 YP participants

and 168 non-participants. The 2008 session of the YP, with the theme “youth and violence,”

included seven participating schools. In the selection of the control group, we sought to

ensure symmetry between the school types and between different family background factors.

Thus, seven schools with the same socioeconomic and cultural profiles as the schools of

participating students (public, private and military) were selected. Likewise, students from

our control group were selected on the basis of similar characteristics, such as gender, age,

grade, social class and parental education.

This article consists of three parts. First, we present studies in civic education and

political sociology and examine their contribution to the understanding of the gains

acquired through political socialization. Second, we analyze the initial attitudes and

changes of attitude among young people in an attempt to assess the impact of the Youth

Parliament on young people’s confidence in the MGSA. Finally, we verify whether the

program provides information gains and whether they are associated with increased

confidence in the MGSA.

Political Socialization and Civic Education

This paper discusses two streams in the literature on political socialization. One

stream is in the field of political sociology and involves the core idea that attitudes, knowledge

and political skills are acquired through socialization (Andolina, Jenkins, Zukin and Keeter

2003; Galston 2001; Jennings and Markus 1984; Sears and Funk1999; Sears and Valentino

1997). The classical view is that the formation of core political attitudes occurs in childhood,

under the predominant influence of the family, and remains stable over the years. Recent

studies (Jennings and Markus 1984; Jennings and Niemi 1974; Sears and Valentino 1997)

have questioned this view, suggesting that 1) important socialization processes occur after

childhood, 2) other agents, depending on the context, are as significant as the family and

3) many attitudes and beliefs formed in childhood are malleable and therefore subject to

change throughout life (Sapiro 2004).

A second tradition investigates the role of civic education in the development of

competent citizens (Campbell 2008; Finkel 2003; Finkel and Ernst 2005; Finkel et al. 2000;

Finkel and Smith 2011; Galston 2001; Niemi and Junn1998; Slomczynski and Shabad1998).

These studies are generally related to projects and programs for civic education in fledgling

democracies and countries undergoing democratic transitions. Researchers in this area are

interested in determining whether these programs, when successful, can make citizens more

informed about politics, more likely to engage in political activities, and more democratic

in their attitudes.

In a manner similar to the literature on political sociology, our research emphasizes

the importance of socializing experiences in an individual’s political development after

childhood. In addition, and similarly to prior research on civic education, our research

investigates programs designed to better inform citizens, and foster political activism,

attitudes, and values consistent with democratic regimes.

The central concept of our study involves socialization “gains.” This concept has been

used in studies that attribute importance to “events” in an individual’s political trajectory,

especially among youngsters. For example, Jennings and Markus’ (1984) panel study (1965,

1973 and 1982) of high school students and their parents concluded that flexibility and

openness to change in attitudes of young people are related to their limited experience

with the world of politics. This inexperience makes young people more vulnerable than

bpsr

(2012) 6 (1) 73 70 - 89

adults to the influence of social (such as war or economic crises) or personal events (such

as migration and marriage). In another study, Sears and Valentino’s (1997) findings on the

significant effect voting for the first time has on young people’s attitudes and knowledge

shows the importance of their first contact with politics. Sears and Valentino suggested

that young voters have more to gain in terms of knowledge acquisition and crystallization

of political attitudes than do adults who have voted several times. The authors argued

that voting is a socialization experience that reduces the gap between those with a greater

stock of information and more stable attitudes towards politics and those with virtually

no information.

The notion of “gains” is also present in the area of civic education. The quality

of democracy is assumed to depend on citizens’ ability to act according to democratic

principles (Galston 2001). This requires knowledge of those principles and their basic rules

of operation, as well as participation, and political tolerance (Finkel 2003; Finkel and Ernst

2005; Finkel et al. 2000). Gains are found when civic programs are able to develop political

behavior that is appropriate in democratic regimes.

More importantly, gains do not occur evenly across every dimension of political

behavior. While most studies conclude that individuals who participate in civic education

programs become more active and better informed citizens, those studies are not as

optimistic in regards to the effects this participation may have on political attitudes.

If we consider the distinction between different political objects (Almond and Verba

1989; Dalton 2004; Easton 1965; Norris 1999), we find that specific objects, such as trust in

political institutions, are more malleable than abstract principles, such as political tolerance

and adherence to democracy. Thus, changes in institutional trust may occur at the same

pace or even faster than cognitive change and political participation.

To better understand the socialization gains in political attitudes, we must establish

criteria for discussing two complex issues: the direction of the expected change (either

positive or negative) and its basis.

It is not easy to determine the direction of change in institutional confidence as a result

of civic programs, unlike identifying knowledge acquisition and political participation.In the

debate on political trust, some authors have called attention to the importance of trust for

the stability of democracy or specific policies (Almond and Verba 1989; Offe 1999; Warren

1999), whereas others have proposed the need for some mistrust to ensure responsiveness

to societal demands (Inglehart 1999; Inglehart and Welzel 2005; Norris 1999). How can we

tell if a particular event or program produces attitudinal gains for the participants? Finkel

et al. (2000, 1855) argue that it is only possible to speak of “gains” when change in political

trust happens as a result of its association with democratic attitudes or the acquisition of

relevant information.

To summarize: if civic education has positive effects on institutional trust, we expect those effects to operate through the individuals’ rejection of previous anti-democratic regimes and through a positive spill-over effect from increased efficacy, interpersonal trust, and other supportive democratic values. If civic education has negative effects on trust, we expect the effects to operate through increased awareness of poor system performance, through an increased sense of the unresponsiveness of local political elites, and through a heightened perception of the gaps between democratic ideals and current political practices.

In this paper, we adopt a similar approach in dealing with attitudinal gains. We

consider gains have occurred whenever a change in attitudes toward political actors and

institutions is founded on acquired information. Therefore, attitudinal changes represent

socialization gains when they are accompanied by informational gains. Conversely, changes

in attitudes are not considered gains if they are based on purely emotional ties.The normative

reference standard is the citizen who, through relevant information, is able to judge political

institutions and, as a consequence thereof, to increase or decrease the degree of trust they

have placed in them (Norris 1999).4

One can consider that the Youth Parliament program has generated gains if

participants’ attitudinal changes have a basis in information on the MGSA acquired during

the program. The data produced by our research do not allow us to examine this question

directly because YP participants were not asked to associate their level of confidence

in the state assembly with any political information they may have acquired about it. In

anticipation of one of our conclusions, we found young people who participated in the

YP to have achieved attitudinal gains because, during the program, they acquired both

knowledge in politics and confidence in the MGSA. While we cannot conclude that there

is a causal relationship between these changes, they stem from the same process of political

socialization. Teenagers who are more informed of MGSA processes, actors, and activities

come to rely more on the institution.

Our expectation is that the Youth Parliament’s dynamics, including its political

content and activities related to legislative practices that are coordinated by the MGSA’s

staff, positively affect young people’s confidence in the institution. The YP enables them to

acknowledge the MGSA and get involved in itsinstitutional development project (Anastasia

2001). This is especially true of project initiatives in increasing the MGSA’s outreach to society.

Initial Conditions and Changes in Time

An examination of the level of young people’s political confidence in the MGSA

prior to the YP reveals that it was not distributed evenly among high school students

in Belo Horizonte who participated in our study. In confirmation of a widely accepted

thesis (Finkel and Ernst 2005; Ichilov 2007; Slomczynski and Shabad 1998), school and

family environments are primarily responsible for these attitudinal differences. Individual

characteristics, such as political efficacy and the degree of knowledge of politics, tell us

nothing about differences in confidence in the MGSA among young people.5

However, this consideration of initial attitudes does not inform us in regards to the

subject of our study: change eventually caused by the YP. A first way to explore this question

is a graphical analysis of the curve of change over time for the groups that were studied.

Figure 1 provides a clear picture of change. There is a decrease in trust among young

people who did not attend the YP and an increase in trust among the participants. If we

consider that students who did not participate in the YP showed a decline in confidence

in the MGSA, the YP’s effects become more apparent: not only does the program help to

prevent this decline; it also increases participants’ confidence.6

There is clearly a growing confidence among YP participants in the MGSA. We ask if

this increase is attributable solely to participation in the Youth Parliament. To answer the

question, we used a regression model with a variable indicating time (before and after the

YP), and another, differentiating the treatment group and the control group. The interaction

between these two variables shows the effects of the Youth Parliament. Because other factors

may interfere with attitude changes during the program, we included in the model a set of

controls associated with socioeconomic conditions and individual attributes.

We organized the data to analyze changes both on an individual level and in the

context of program implementation in school.7 On an individual level, we classified the

students into a treatment group and a control group. We created two categories: 0 = no

participation and 1 = YP participant.8 For contextual analysis, the classification criterion

Mario Fuks and Gabriel Avila Casalecchi

was the success the program showed in each school. Two types of information were used as

a proxy for success: the number of times students in each school engaged in debate and the

average percentage of aggregate attendance in Youth Parliament workshops at each school.

The volume of talk indicates whether the YP was a dynamic experience. In the second

case, the average aggregate attendance indicates whether the experience, as a whole, was

motivating. The scale of success included the following categories: 0 = no participation, 1 =

participant in a school in which the YP was not successful (neither dynamic nor motivating),

2 = participant in a school in which the YP was successful (dynamic or motivating), 3 =

participant in a school in which the YP was very successful (dynamic and motivating).

Our two-level model of analysis aims to demonstrate the advantage of using

explanatory models of change triggered by political socialization experiences. These models

include distinctions in terms of participation in the program and its context.9

Table 2 shows the effect of the YP on the individual level of analysis. The data are

unequivocal: participation in the program increased confidence in the MGSA. Even when

we control for family and school environments and for individual characteristics, such as

political efficacy and exposure to political information in the media, participants in the

Youth Parliament were more than twice as likely to trust the MGSA than were students

who did not participate in the program.

Program effects were found to also depend on the program’s success in schools.

The program showed significant effects on participants in schools in which, according to

our criteria, it was considered successful. These effects were much larger when the program

was entirely successful. In this case, the students’ trust in the assembly was almost five

times higher than trust displayed by students in the control group.

In summary, the impact of the YP on students’ attitudes depends on an individual

factor – participation in the program – and on a contextual factor associated with the quality

of the program in the school.

The Cognitive Basis of Attitudinal Change

How should the increase in confidence in MGSA found in young people who participated

in the Youth Parliament be interpreted? We consider two possible interpretations. First,

the change in attitude could have occurred spontaneously as a result of the bond formed

with the institution, its employees, and representatives. In this case, the sudden increase

in confidence and positive attitudes toward the state assembly would be tied to a purely

emotional basis.

The other possible reason – which we argue to be the case – is that confidence in the

MGSA occurs in an environment of constant information flow regarding the legislative

process, the institution, its function and activities, and its interaction with the community.

This does not mean that high school students acquired, in only a few months, deep and

detailed knowledge of issues that even most educated citizens lack. Even so, their attitudinal

change is expected to be accompanied by cognitive changes, albeit modest ones.

Our research provides data that allow us to address the cognitive foundations of

attitudinal changes. At first we tested a political information index. This model leads

to the inevitable conclusion that the Youth Parliament did not provide cognitive gains.10

Young people who participated in the program “learned” next to nothing of prominent

political leaders, party ideologies, or even about acronyms that stand for political and

social organizations. This is not surprising because the YP does not prepare young people

for a test of their general knowledge of politics. A significant portion of the program’s

content involves broader issues, such as concepts of citizenship, democracy, and political

participation.

However, it is not the case that the YP taught participants only abstract concepts.

Upon completion of the program, participants were able to name a greater number of state

representatives. The YP also proved efficient in transmitting information about events

created by the MGSA to stimulate dialogue and the participation of organized sectors of

civil society in the legislative process.

The YP provided an excellent education on legislative procedures, especially the

ones students were in contact with during the program. As an example, students who

participated in the YP were fifteen times more likely to be familiar with markup procedure

(by means of which bills are amended during debate), even after controlling for variables of

family and school environments.11 The Youth Parliament also contributed to informing its

participants of issues in local politics.One indication of this knowledge is that participants

knew the names of more mayoral candidates in Belo Horizonte city in the 2008 elections

than the control group.

These data suggest that the increase in confidence in and knowledge of the MGSA

and related issues occurred during the same period and resulted from the same political

socialization experience. The simultaneity and common origin of cognitive and attitudinal

changes does not necessarily mean that these two phenomena are linked. However, they

suggest that the program had double effects. Even if young participants failed to use

knowledge acquired during the program, or the knowledge contributed to supporting (or

even reducing) their previous trust in the state legislature, YP participants were prepared

to form their attitudes on more solid cognitive bases.

A set of questions about the participants’ perceptions of the MGSA contributed to

the analysis of the relationship between attitudinal and cognitive changes. Weasked the

participants if they considered the MGSA transparent, dynamic, independent and open

to the participation of civil society. As opposed to expressions of pure confidence in the

MGSA, these questions have a clear evaluative component that depends on respondents’

existing information regarding the institution. For this reason, each question offers the

alternative “I don’t know”.

We can see a significant shift of responses to positive attitudes among the YP

participants.12 If this were simply an indication of a migration of negative to positive

attitudes, there would be no novelty in relation to what we already know about the increase

in confidence in the MGSA. The additional information supplied by the data is the migration

of “I don’t know” responses to favorable opinions of the MGSA. After participating in

the program, high school students became more favorable toward the MGSA and more

confident in their opinion thereof.

Therefore, we know that young people who participated in the program changed

their attitudes in the same direction, learned about politics, and began to feel more secure

in regards to their evaluation of the MGSA. However, can we conclude that the increase

in confidence in MGSA represents attitudinal “gains”? There are strong indications that

these changes were, in fact, gains, but any measure of certaintythat increased confidence

in the MGSA has a cognitive basis would require the identification of a direct association

between attitudes and cognition.

To answer this question, we used the method of “difference in difference.” The variables

used were derived by subtracting the values at time 1 (before the YP) from values at time

2 (after the YP took place) for each of the two groups (treatment and control). The result

of this transaction represents a change in the variable values over time for each group.

The answer, although modest, is positive. We find a positive correlation between

knowledge of MGSA-related events and trust in the institution. The same is not true for

knowledge regarding Minas Gerais’ state representatives. However, this does not mean

that the knowledge gains and attitudinal gains are independent processes. This point

is emphatically supported by the association between perceptions of the assembly and

knowledge items. A comparison between the group that participated in the program and

the control group shows that the attitudes of the former have stronger cognitive bases.First,

there is a clear association between the increase of knowledge about the representatives and

the increase in the MGSA’s positive image. The correlation between knowledge acquisition

regarding legislative events and an increase in positive evaluations of the state assembly

is even more significant. The control group gave no indication of an association between

cognitive and attitudinal change.

Thus, it can be said that the political socialization that took place during the program

not only resulted in an increase in knowledge and confidence in MGSA but also that many

participants who changed their attitudes acquired information that established consistent

attitudes regarding the MGSA. This does not mean that a “gain” in confidence is devoid

of any affective component; it means that this gain cannot be accounted for solely by that

component.13

One question remains: are there grounds,in political reality, for these attitudinalgains?

Why does learning about theMGSAincrease respondents’ level of confidence? The data

fromour studydo not providea direct answer to this question. We know, however, that what

makes the Minas Gerais State Assembly unique among Brazilian subnational legislatures

is the new institutional setting that emerged in the early 1990s. In an atmosphere of

institutional innovation (Anastasia2001), the MGSA modernized its structure and

administration, increased staff professionalism, and became more democratic in its

organization, by outreaching to the community and establishing an ongoing dialogue and

participationin the legislative process. The Youth Parliament is an offshoot of this new

context, and participants have witnessed and experienced this reality.

Concluding Remarks

The research results presented in this article are straight forward. In as little as a

few months, the students who attended the Youth Parliament activities showed increased

confidence in the Minas Gerais Legislative Assembly. That confidence increased even

further when the program in the school was found to be dynamic and motivating. Thus,

attitudinal changes can occur at the same pace as (or an even faster than) changes in

political knowledge and participation.

Furthermore, after attending the program, youngsters became more aware of legislative

procedures and the state representatives, more knowledgeable in regards to the MGSA and

more willing to obtain information from the media about the state assembly. They did not

necessarily gain a great deal of knowledge of politics.Far from leaving the program with an

encyclopedic knowledge (Lupia 1994) of the topic, students’ cognitive gains were found to

be limited and fragmented; however, these gains were more than enough to broaden their

understanding of politics and, particularly, of the MGSA. Knowing the names of Minas

Gerais’ state representatives and mayoral candidates, events organized by the MGSA, and

legislative procedures seems to say little on the formation of politically competent citizens.

However, one may be demanding too much in expecting high school students who took

part in a dozen meetings in a three-month program to show even more significant gains .

Besides, we assume that it is possible to relate the limited knowledge items of our

questionnaire to a wider repertoire of knowledge. It is reasonable to expect that students

who can name representatives also have more knowledge of their activities than those who

cannot. Likewise, students who are able to identify the activities promoted by the MGSA

are more likely to have more information about the institution than those who do not.

In short, we found that participation in the Youth Parliament did lead to attitudinal

gains. Let us keep in mind, however, that public confidence in political institutions is

not intrinsically valuable to democracy. In this article, “gains” mean that the increased

confidence in the MGSA has cognitive bases, which is a desirable outcome.

It is important to note that gains from the YP presented in this article are specifically

related to the state legislature and not to other institutions or political actors. This distinction

works as an antidote to the common and undesirable effect of “contamination” (Parker

1977; Rennó and Gramacho 2010) in perceptions of political institutions and actors. We

would not be surprised if new evidence revealed that the shield that prevents positive

attitude changes towards the MGSA from extending to state deputies and other political

institutions is built by cognitive gains provided by the YP program.

2. The project was designed to include 351 interviews in the pretest and 351 in the post-test, for a total of 702 interviews. However, we were only able to interview 335 students in the post-test. Thus, we decided to exclude from the analysis cases missing in the post-test.

3. The first round was conducted between February and April 2008, and the second round was conducted between June and November 2008.

4. Since the 1990s, there has been a fruitful debate on trust (or mistrust) in political institutions and its effect on democracy (Dalton 2004; Inglehart 1999; Pharr and Putnam 2000; Norris 1999). This debate calls into question the assumption of the classical theory of political culture, which suggests that confidence in political institutions fosters the stability of the democratic regime.

5. Regarding trust in the MGSA, there was no difference between the treatment group and the control group prior to the experience of the YP, which confirms the reliability of pairing both groups. On a scale of 0 to 3, the average confidence of the control group was 1.41, whereas for the participants it was 1.50. This difference is not statistically significant (0.289).

6. A test of means indicates that the differences shown in the chart are statistically significant. The difference between time 1 and time 2 was -0.12 for non-participants (significance 0.06) and 0.19 for participants (significance 0.008).

7. Because there were only 14 schools, we decided not to use multilevel regression models. The dependence of observations within each school was corrected by using the robust cluster in Stata.

8. The total number of workshops (including those that occurred at school and at the MGSA) ranged from ten to twelve, depending on the school. The total number of meetings in school ranged from seven to ten.

9. Ideally, this model would integrate the individual factor (including the degree of exposure of individuals to the program) and the contextual factor (the success of the YP at school). However, because of the limited number of observations in our database, it was not possible to create an integrated model with variables that included both levels of analysis.

10. The construction of the information index that we tested appears in the appendix of this

article. We used a linear regression model in which the variable of political information was the dependent variable and the variables of time, treatment and their interaction were independent. The coefficients were not statistically significant.

11. We used a logistic regression model with the following controls: parental education, parental

political participation, school type, subjective efficacy, media exposure and sex. The significance level was 0.001.

12. The questions were as follows. 1) In your opinion, is the Minas Gerais State Assembly closed

to the participation of society or open to the participation of society?; 2) In your opinion, is the Minas Gerais State Assembly a transparent institution that informs people about its acts or an institution that is not transparent and does not show the public what happens there?; 3) In your opinion, is the Minas Gerais State Assembly an institution without initiative that simply fulfills its duties or a dynamic and innovative institution?; 4) In your opinion, does the Minas Gerais State Assembly lack freedom of choice and yield to the will of the governor, or is it an independent institution that acts according to its own will? All questions offered the possible answer “don’t know.”

13. However, our research has no data with which to test this hypothesis.

Parents’ education. A construct was created by factor analysis (principal axis).

It generated a variable of parents’ education, which combined the years of schooling of

the respondent’s father and mother. The two original variables were measured in terms

of a complete or incomplete educational degree. To turn these variables into continuous

variables, following the strategy of Bills and Haller (1984), we assigned the following values

to the years of schooling: 0 (never attended school), 2 (1st to 4th grade of basic education,

incomplete), 4 (1st to 4th grade of basic education, complete), 6 (5th to 8th grade of basic

education, incomplete), 8 (5th to 8th grade of basic education, complete), 9.5 (1 to 3 years

of secondary education, incomplete), 11 (1 to 3 years of secondary education, complete),

13 (incomplete higher education), 15 (college degree), 16 (graduate education, incomplete)

and 17 (graduate degree).

Parents’ political participation. A construct was created using factor analysis (principal

axis). It generated a variable of parents’ political participation, which combined the political

participation of the respondent’s father and mother. The original individual values for the

political participation of the father and mother were the sum of the number of associations,

parties, and trade unions with which they were engaged.

Types of schools. One of the variables in our database sought to capture the school

environment in a single indicator. The categories were defined as follows: public school,

public military school, middle-class private school and elite private school. We created

dummy variables from the four categories. The criteria used for the classification of schools

as elite and middle class were tuition and geographic location. No middle-class school tuition

was higher than R$ 520, whereas the fees of elite schools ranged from R$ 642 to R$ 738.

Elite schools, in addition to being publicly recognized as the “best schools,” were located

in the most valued neighborhoods of Belo Horizonte city. In the case of public schools and

the military (also public), the classification represents their formal identity.

Subjective political efficacy. We provided the statement, “Sometimes politics and

government seem so complicated that a person like you cannot really understand what

is happening.” The answer was given on a Likert scale of five points, with the following

options: strongly agree, partly agree, neither agree nor disagree, partly disagree and strongly

disagree. We created a binary variable, excluding the middle option, so that each of the

new categories included all of the attitudes expressed in one of two directions (agreeing

or disagreeing).

Exposure to information in the media. We asked how often the interviewee was

exposed to political information through mass media, specifically through three types of

media: a) TV and radio, b) newspapers and magazines and c) the Internet. Each of the three

Annex

(2012) 6 (1) 88

types of media was given a rating for exposure (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = a few times a

month, 3 = a few times a week, 4 = daily). The final variable was the sum of the answers

to three questions.

Factual knowledge. We constructed an index of respondents’ political information by

factor analysis (principal axis) from four different sets of questions about political affairs.

The four sets were classified as follows. 1) Knowledge of leading politicians’ offices and

political parties: the questions were open and asked respondents to state the party and office

held by four leading politicians in Brazil: AecioNeves, Fernando Pimentel, José Serra, and

Martha Suplicy. There was also a question about the office and country of Hugo Chavez.

The questions were coded according to four levels of accuracy (3 = full accuracy, 2 =

incomplete accuracy, missing some information either about the name of the office or its

state level, 1 = stated the politician’s previous office, 0 = error or no response). The final

index for the set of variables was the result of the factor analysis (principal axis). Cronbach’s

alpha was 0.867, and all variable loads were satisfactory. 2) Number of parties that the

respondent was able to name: this set of variables was a list of the parties the interviewee

knew. For every Brazilian party named correctly, the interviewee earned a point, while

a non-response or error was worth zero. The index was constructed by the sum of the

scores and ranged from 0 to 11. 3) Knowledge of the meaning of abbreviations for political

and social organizations: respondents were asked to state the meaning of TRE (Regional

Electoral Tribunal), ONU (United Nations), UNE (National Union of Students) and MST

(Landless Workers’ Movement). The questions were open and were post-coded into three

levels (2 = full meaning; 1 = partial meaning, restricted its general subject, 0 = error or no

response). The index was constructed by factor analysis (principal axis). The Cronbach’s

alpha was 0.597, and all variable loads were satisfactory. 4) Knowledge of the ideological

position of parties: the respondent was asked to state whether each of four Brazilian parties

(DEM, PCdoB, PSTU and PP) were left or right. Each correct answer was worth 1 point.

The index was the sum of correct answers.

Trust in Minas Gerais State Assembly. The question asked was, “Regarding Minas

Gerais State Assembly, you (1) never trust it, (2) trust it sometimes, (3) trust it most of the

time or (4) always trust it.” A binary variable was created, with “never trust” and “trust

sometimes” = 0 and “trust most of the time” and “always trust” = 1.

Knowledge of the names of deputies. The following question was asked: “Could you

tell me the name of any deputy of the Minas Gerais State Assembly?” Two points were

awarded for the representative’s full name, and one point was awarded for an incomplete

name. This scale was then categorized for the multinomial model, with 0 = 0, 1 = 2, and

3 = all others.

Annex

bpsr

(2012) 6 (1) 89

Knowledge of Minas Gerais State Assembly forums for civil society. The question

asked was, “The Minas Gerais Legislative offers many possibilities for participation to

the population. Could you name any of them?” In case of no spontaneous response, the

interviewee was asked if he knew of the following: a) legislative seminars, b) technical

forums, c) public hearings or d) commission of popular participation. The variable was

then constructed from the spontaneous and forced responses. Each spontaneous response

was assigned two points. Each forced response was assigned one point. The responses

were added to create a scale from zero to four. This scale was then categorized for the

multinomial model, with 0 = 0, 1 = 1, and 2 = all others.

“Markup.”. The question asked was, “Markup is a legislative procedure. A bill is

subject to markup a) when the representative wants to express full support for its content,

b) when the subject was superficially addressed, c) to promote changesto the bill, d) to

block a vote or e) you don’t know.” The correct answer (c) was assigned the value 1, and

all other answers were assigned the value 0.

Knowledge of the candidates for mayor in the 2008 elections. The following question

was asked: “Who are the mayoral candidates in Belo Horizonte’s 2008 election whose

names you remember?”.
