Voice, Representation and Trust in Parliament

Abstract: The procedural justice literature argues that providing individuals voice in institutional processes facilitates trust in that institution. For democratic institutions, voice is provided to the citizenry via political representation. In this article, I apply the procedural justice argument to trust in parliament, equating representation with voice: if individuals believe they are represented in parliament, they will trust parliament more than if they believe otherwise. Analyses of data from three of four countries find support for this argument: those individuals who believe that a party with at least one seat in parliament represents their views trust parliament more than those who do not. This relationship holds even when accounting for political self-interest. For those who wish to promote trust in parliament, a suggested normative good with a host of politically important consequences, one potential pathway is to facilitate individuals’ belief that there is a party in parliament that represents them.

Keywords: Voice, Representation, Trust in Parliament, Procedural Justice, Left-Right Congruence

Modern representative democracy requires citizens to authorize a small group of political

elites to govern in their stead. This process entails that citizens trust that their elected

representatives will advocate for their interests in the processes of government. Recent

research, built on the procedural justice literature, argues that individuals trust parliament

more if they believe they have a voice (i.e., the ability to express one’s political preferences),

in the form of a selected representative, in the policy-making process (Dunn, 2012). As the

overwhelming majority of individuals never participate directly in parliament, they instead

gain voice through representation. Individuals will thereby trust parliament more when their

elected representative is perceived to advocate for their political preferences in the policy making process.

Research in the representative congruence literature argues, either explicitly or implicitly,

that electors and representatives should align on some relevant measure(s) of policy

preference, often Left-Right identification/classification (Andeweg, 2011; Blais & Bodet,

2006; Dalton, Farrell, & McAllister, 2011; Golder & Stramski, 2010; Holmberg, 2011; Huber

& Powell, 1994; M. Kim, 2009; Powell, 2009). Though there is debate regarding whether

alignment results from bottom-up or top-down processes (or some combination of both), in

any case, ideological alignment is suggested to be of central importance, with democratic

representation considered normatively better where the policy preferences of the electorate

and the parliament are ideologically congruent. Specifically, the congruence literature argues

that the ideological distribution of the parliament should, as closely as possible, match that of

the electorate. There are however, other ways of conceiving of representation, descriptive

representation being the most readily apparent (cf., Mansbridge, 1999). Certain conceptions

of representation suggest that parliament should act as the political voice of the electorate in

the policy-making process. Verba (1993, p. 677) argues that a “bedrock principle” of modern

democracy states that “in what the government does, the preferences and interests of each

citizen ought to be given equal consideration.” Modern democratic representation should

therefore make “voice its most active and consonant manifestation and judgment about just

and unjust laws and policies its content” (Urbinati, 2006, p. 19). Though this argument does

not necessarily translate to the equivalent individual-level argument that an individual

representative act as the voice of his or her elector, from the perspective of the elector, this is

precisely the purpose of a representative. For the individual-level perspective, a

representative is a person or party chosen to provide voice to the elector in the policy-making

process.

An individual perceives himself to have voice in the policy-making process, then, when he

believes a party in parliament is representative of his interests, however an individual may

define such. Since an individual tends to trust an institution (or process) more where he

perceives himself to have a voice in the institution (or process) (Culnan & Armstrong, 1999;

Grimes, 2006; van den Bos, Wilke, & Lind, 1998), he will trust parliament more if he

perceives that a party which holds at least one seat in parliament represents his interests. This

article examines this hypothesis using data from recent waves of the Austrian, Dutch, New

Zealand and Swiss Election Studies. Regression analyses indicate that believing one is

represented by a party in parliament does, in most cases examined, result in a higher level of

trust in parliament.

Trust and Voice in Parliament

Political trust has been an issue of interest to political scientists for decades. Political trust is

often considered a fundamental indicator of the health and legitimacy of a democracy and

crucial to its stability. Mishler and Rose (2001), for example, state that “popular trust in

political institutions is vital to democracy.” In addition to normative concerns, a number of

quantitative investigations demonstrate that political trust impacts such political attitudes and

behaviors as policy preferences (Hetherington, 2005), voter turnout (Cox, 2003; Grönlund &

Setälä, 2007), vote-choice (Bélanger & Nadeau, 2005; Hetherington, 1999; Hooghe, Marien,

& Pauwels, 2011), and perceived acceptability of illegal behavior (Marien & Hooghe, 2011).

Political trust affects not only the normative legitimacy of democratic governance but also

substantive outcomes associated with that governance.

The various facets and levels of political trust have gradually been fleshed out as research in

this area has evolved. Political trust covers a spectrum divided into five (perhaps not so

distinct, cf., Bowler & Karp, 2004) categories which proceed from diffuse to specific support

(Easton, 1965, 1975): political community, regime principles, regime performance, regime

institutions, and political actors (Norris, 1999a). As the institution most often referred to as

the voice of the people and most often studied by those interested in representation, this paper

focuses on trust in parliament, one aspect of the second most specific level of political trust,

trust in regime institutions.

Trust in parliament is undoubtedly the result of myriad factors, some self-interested, some

beneficent, some cognitive, and some affective. One recent suggestion regards the influence

perceived voice exerts on trust in parliament (Dunn, 2012). This argument, developed from

theory and evidence from the procedural justice literature, states that an individual will trust

parliament more if he believes he has a voice in the parliament via a self-selected

representative.

In modern representative democracy, individuals necessarily grant representatives the power

to act on their behalf in the processes of governing (cf., Montesquieu, 2002 [1748]). In doing

so, they abdicate control of their political lives to others and thereby place themselves at risk

of neglect, harm, or worse. Even though unable to act on their own behalf, when individuals

are given the opportunity to express their interests as respected members of the community

(Anand, 2001; Folger, 1977; Lind, Kanfer, & Earley, 1990; Lind & Tyler, 1988; Tyler &

Blader, 2003; Tyler & Lind, 1992), they gain a sense of control (van Prooijen, 2009) and

certainty about the future (Lind & van den Bos, 2002) that they may otherwise lack. A

perception of dignity and voice builds trust where authority is exercised by another whom

one does not personally know and whose actions one cannot directly control (Culnan &

Armstrong, 1999; van den Bos, et al., 1998). Individuals are thereby more likely to trust

institutions where they perceive themselves to have a voice in those decisions that affect them

and their community.

Importantly, the impact of perceived voice on the perception of fair process and trust in

institutions goes above and beyond simple self-interest; even when outcomes are negative,

the process by which those outcomes are reached is of considerable importance for individual

perceptions of fairness and trust. The perception of voice often results in the belief that the

outcome, even if negative, is fair (Lind & Tyler, 1988; Thibaut & Walker, 1978; Walker,

Lind, & Thibaut, 1979) which, in turn, produces greater levels of institutional trust (Culnan &

Armstrong, 1999; W. C. Kim & Mauborgne, 2003). A desire for voice is not simply the

expression of a desire for favorable outcomes, but a desire to be a valued member of the

group. Perceived provision of voice, believing that one’s voice is heard and acknowledged,

facilitates trust in those institutions where authority is held by another.

This is, of course, not to say that self-interest plays no part in the level of trust one expresses

in institutions. Procedural justice research often finds that individuals trust processes and

institutions more where those processes and institutions serve their self-interest (e.g.,

Korsgaard, Schweiger, & Sapienza, 1995; Lind, et al., 1990; Tyler, 1994). A number of

studies of trust in political institutions indicate that trust is higher among electoral or policy

winners – i.e., among those individuals who voted for or agree with the policy outputs of

those currently in power (Anderson & LoTempio, 2002; Banducci & Karp, 2003;

Hetherington, 1998; Miller, 1974; Miller & Borrelli, 1991; Norris, 1999b). As with

nonpolitical institutions, trust in political institutions will likely result from a mixture of

perception of voice and self-interested outcomes, among other things.

Individuals express greater trust in an institution when they believe they have a voice in that

institution, even when that institution produces outcomes they do not agree with. In political

terms, individuals will report greater trust in parliament if they feel they are represented in

parliament even if the government is controlled by a non-favored party or coalition. Based

on the proposed relationship, I derive and test the following prediction:

P1: Trust in parliament will be positively related to perceived representation by a party with

at least one seat in parliament.

Data and Measurement

There are two variables needed to examine the above prediction: trust in parliament and

perceived representation by a party in parliament. There are a number of surveys that include

a confidence or trust in parliament inquiry, with both of these items often used as indicators

of trust in parliament. The second variable, perceived representation, is less straightforward.

There are two measures that appear in a number of election surveys that can be considered to

measure such. The first directly inquires as to whether the respondent feels represented by a

political party, and if so, which one. Linking this question to the most recent parliamentary

election allows one to determine whether the respondent feels represented by a party with at

least one seat in parliament. The second and less direct measure, is whether an individual’s

vote-choice is perceived to be ideologically proximate to their own Left-Right placement.

This is a one-to-one measure of ideological-congruence (Golder & Stramski, 2010) that

utilizes intra-individual perceptions of the respondent’s own and his vote-choice’s location on

the Left-Right scale; an ideological-congruence measure that avoids differential item

functioning (DIF) issues which can arise due to assuming inter-individual measurement

equivalency where it does not exist (Aldrich & McKelvey, 1977; King, Murray, Salomon, &

Tandon, 2004). This second measure makes the rather large assumptions that Left-Right

placements of self and parties mean something to the respondent and that perceived

congruence between these placements is equivalent to representation. Both the empirical and

theoretical literature provide numerous arguments both for and against each of these

assumptions. It is therefore preferable to use the former measure, or at least to confirm the

convergent validity of the latter measure against the former.

Ideally, I would prefer to examine my stated hypothesis using data from a large-scale cross country survey. This would ensure that any findings resulting from the analyses were

applicable regardless of the political environment. This would also allow me to examine any

potential conditioning factors – such as whether certain electoral systems or regime types

condition the relationship between representation and trust in parliament.

Unfortunately, there is currently no large-scale cross-country dataset that provides both a

confidence/trust in parliament measure and both, or even one, of the perceived representation

measures. There are a small number of relatively recent election studies that include the trust

in parliament inquiry and inquiries relevant to creating both of the perceived representation

measures: the 2009 Austrian National Election Study (AUTNES; http://www.autnes.at/), the

2002 Dutch Parliamentary Election Study (DPES; http://www.dpes.nl/), the 2002 and 2008

New Zealand Election Studies (NZES; http://nzes.org), and the 2007 Swiss Election Study

(SELECTS; http://www2.unil.ch/selects/). Each of these surveys provide the necessary

individual-level data on trust in parliament, whether one feels represented by a political party

(and which one), ideological self-identification, the perception of the ideological placement

of major parties, and vote-choice, as well as a number of theoretically relevant control

variables. This limited selection of cases restricts the conclusions that can be drawn from the

following analyses, but does allow me to determine whether the hypothesis receives support

in at least a handful of Established Democracies.

The 2009 Austrian National Election Survey is a post-election survey of 1,165 enfranchised

Austrian residents aged 18 and above. The fieldwork was conducted in German using

computer assisted personal interviewing. The sample was drawn using multiple stratification

with a clustered address random procedure (Kritzinger et al., 2013).

The 2002 Dutch Parliamentary Election Survey is a pre- and post-election survey of 1574

residents. The trust in parliament question is asked in the post-election survey, while the

representation-relevant questions (see below) are split between the pre- and post election

surveys. The interviews were conducted using computer assisted personal interviewing for

all the pre-election interviews as well as for a majority of re-interviewees – a minority of re interviewees were surveyed via self-administered surveys. The sample was drawn using a

random sample of telephone numbers from a random sample of municipalities.

The 2002 New Zealand Election Survey is a post-election survey of 5783 enfranchised

residents aged 18 and above. Respondents completed the survey using mail and telephone

questionnaires. The sample consists of both a “new general sample” and follow-up panel

samples. Both sample groups were randomly selected from the electoral register,

proportionate to each of the then 62 regular parliamentary electorates; the 7 Maori electorates

were oversampled and therefore not proportionately sampled. The 2008 sample was gathered

similarly, consisting of 3042 individuals, including an oversample of 636 Maori.

The 2007 Swiss Election Survey is a post-election survey of 4392 Swiss citizens. The sample

consists of a nationally representative sample mixed with an oversampling of small cantons

to ensure at least 100 interviews per canton.

The dependent variable is an individual's trust in parliament. For Austria, this variable is

determined via reference to the respondent's answer to the following inquiry: "How much do

you trust… the Austrian parliament?" For the Netherlands: “How much trust do you have in

the Second Chamber?” For New Zealand in 2002: “please indicate how much trust and

confidence would you say you have in parliament.” For New Zealand in 2008: "please

indicate how much trust and confidence you have in Parliament." For Switzerland: “Please

tell me for each institution how much trust you have in it…: Parliament.” Unfortunately,

there is a diverse range of possible responses for each case, with only Austria and

Switzerland using a similar metric, making any comparison between countries difficult.

However, to provide some sense of comparison, I transform trust in parliament in each case

to range from 0 to 1, inclusive. With the above caveat in mind, in order from the lowest to

the highest transformed mean: New Zealand (2002) = 0.542, Netherlands (2002) = 0.575,

Austria (2008) = 0.580, New Zealand (2008) = 0.581, and Switzerland (2007) = 0.642.

Comparison of means using a two-sample t-statistic indicates that 7 of the 10 comparisons

yield statistically significant differences, with New Zealand (2002) being significantly lower

and Switzerland (2007) being significantly higher than the three middle-level cases, and each

other; the three middle-level cases are statistically indistinguishable from one another.

Above, I suggest two possible indicators of whether an individual believes he is represented

in parliament. The first uses a more direct tact, asking whether the individual feels

represented by a political party and then determining whether that party holds a seat in

parliament. The question for the AUTNES reads: “Would you say that any of the parties in

Austria represent your views reasonably well?” For the DPES (pre-election survey): “Is there

in the Netherlands a political party which on the whole reflects or represents your opinion

best?” For both iterations of the NZES: “Would you say that any of the parties in New

Zealand represent your views reasonably well?” And for the SELECTS: “Is there a party that

represents your personal views well?” A follow-up question inquires as to which party. If

the reported party holds at least one seat in parliament, the individual is coded as believing

(s)he is represented by a party in parliament (=1). If the person responds with a “no” to the

initial inquiry or does not answer either question, the individual is coded as not believing

(s)he is represented by a party in parliament (=0). There is considerable difference between

cases in the proportion of people who believe they are represented according to this measure:

Switzerland reports the lowest proportion of people who believe they are represented, at

0.437, followed by New Zealand (2002) at 0.656, Austria at 0.611, the Netherlands at 0.705,

and New Zealand (2008) at 0.811.

One drawback to this measure: as a result of each country relying on either a proportional or

mixed-member proportional representation electoral system, an overwhelming majority of

respondents who report a party, report a party that is represented in the parliament. This

means there is very little difference between this measure and a measure simply coding

whether a person feels represented by a political party.

The second possibility suggested above is a measure of vote-congruence, a respondent’s

perceived Left-Right congruence between himself and his reported vote choice. This variable

is determined via reference to the respondent's Left-Right self-placement, his/her reported

vote choice, and his/her perception of the Left-Right placement of his/her vote choice. In

Austria, the respondent's perception of the Left-Right placement of political parties is

determined via reference to the following question: "In politics people sometimes talk of left

and right. Thinking of the parties in Austria, where would you place the following parties on

a scale from 1 to 11 where 1 means the left and 11 means the right?" Respondents were

asked to place the following parties: SPÖ, ÖVP, FPÖ, Grüne, BZÖ, LIF, and Liste

Dinkhauser. Respondents in the Netherlands were asked a substantively similar question and

asked to place the following parties: PvdA, VVD, D66, GroenLinks, CDA, SGP,

ChristenUnie, Leefbaar Nederland, SP, and Lijst Pim Fortuyn. For the 2002 New Zealand

election survey respondents were asked to place the following parties: National, Labour, New

Zealand First, Alliance, Act, Green, Progressive Coalition, and United Future. For the 2008

New Zealand election survey: National, Labour, NZ First, United Future, Act, Green Party,

Progressive, and the Maori Party. For the Swiss election survey: CVP, FDP, SP, SVP,

Gruene, LPS, EVP, and LEGA. The request for Left-Right party placement was followed by

a request for the respondent to place themselves on the same scale. In Austria, for example:

"And what about yourself? Where would you place yourself on a scale from 1 to 11, where 1

means left and 11 means right?" For the Netherlands, both the self- and party-placement

inquiries were asked in the post-election survey. An individual's vote choice is determined

via reference to a question directly asking if the respondent voted in the recent elections, and

if so, for which party.

The respondent's vote-congruence is equal to ten minus the absolute value of the difference

between the respondent's Left-Right placement and the Left-Right placement of his vote choice. This produces an individual-level Left-Right-congruence score ranging from 0 to 10

with 10 being a precise match and 0 being the most extreme mismatch. Though this variable

can range from 0 to 10, for Austria vote-congruence ranges from 1 to 10 and in the

Netherlands, from 3 to 10. The distribution is heavily negatively skewed with the mean

ranging from 8.569 (in Switzerland) to 8.997 (in the Netherlands); over 90% of respondents

in each case (who were not removed from the analyses due to missing data) score between 7

and 10, inclusive.

Issues of accuracy in the Left-Right placement of parties, and therefore issues of projection

bias (seeing one’s vote choice as ideologically more similar to oneself than is actually the

case), are not an issue with this measure as it is solely concerned with individuals’

perceptions. The argument in this paper, as well as in the procedural justice literature in

general, is that the perception of voice matters for trust; in fact, it is precisely the relevance of

perception over reality that leads some authors to express concerns regarding the potential of

elite manipulation of perception to elicit trust in potentially unjust institutions (Cohen, 1989;

Dunn, 2012).

Examining the relationship between the two suggested independent variables gives reason to

suspect that perceived Left-Right vote-congruence may not accurately reflect whether an

individual believes he is represented. Table 1 presents the output from three separate

analyses analyzing the relationship between the two measures. The first analysis is a simple

difference in means test between the vote-congruence scores of those who believe they are

represented by a party in parliament and those who do not. Those who believe they are

represented in parliament have a higher mean vote-congruence score than those who do not,

and this difference is significant in three of the five cases analyzed: Austria (2008), the

Netherlands (2002), and New Zealand (2002). There is a non-significant difference for New

Zealand (2008) and Switzerland (2007). Pairwise correlations echo this result. There are

minimal and inconsistently significant correlations between vote-congruence and whether

one feels represented in parliament. A logistic regression of feeling represented on vote congruence again echoes these results indicating that the predicted probability of feeling

represented is higher for those with a higher level of vote-congruence, but this increase in

probability is only significantly different from zero in the same three cases noted above.

[INSERT TABLE 1 HERE]

These two variables, though somewhat related in three of the five cases examined here, are

clearly measuring different concepts (or are substantially differentially susceptible to noise);

though these concepts are certainly related to some degree in three of the five cases. As the

more direct measure possesses a higher degree of face validity, I will focus primarily on this

variable from here on. However, I retain the vote-congruence measure for inclusion in the

following analyses as this variable is at least a face-valid indicator of how an individual

perceives his relationship to his vote choice in terms of the Left-Right continuum.

In addition to the variables discussed above, research often argues for the inclusion of a

number of other relevant variables hypothesized to influence political trust: age; education;

gender; whether an individual’s vote choice is included in government (electoral winner); an

individual’s Left-Right identification; and an individual’s perception of the health of the

economy (perception of economy) (e.g., Anderson & LoTempio, 2002; Banducci & Karp,

2003; Norris, 1999a).

Perception of the Economy: The perception of economy variable reflects the respondent's

view of the state of the economy. The measurement of this variable varies from country to

country though it is intended to capture perceptions of economic health. In Austria this

variable is measured via reference to the following question: "How would you evaluate, very

generally, the current economic situation of Austria?" In the Netherlands: “do you think that

the economic situation has been influenced favorably, unfavorably or neither by the

government policies?” In New Zealand 2002 and 2008: "How do you think the general

economic situation in the country now compares with a year ago?" In Switzerland: “In your

opinion: how is the current economic situation in Switzerland?” Each of these questions

takes a slightly different approach to the intended concept and as such, the variable has

slightly different meaning in each country. Nevertheless, the variable does, in each case,

measure a respondent’s perception of the economy, whether from an absolute perspective or

relative to an earlier point of comparison. Higher values for this variable indicate a more

negative view of the economy and should therefore be negatively related to trust in

parliament.

Left-Right Identification: This variable indicates the respondent's Left-Right identification

and is measured, as noted above, by reference to the following question in Austria and a

substantively similar question in each of the other 4 surveys: "In politics people sometimes

talk of left and right… Where would you place yourself on a scale from 1 to 11, where 1

means left and 11 means right?"

Electoral Winner: This variable reflects whether the respondent's vote choice is represented

in government, in the cabinet. Following the 2008 election, the Austrian cabinet consisted of

members of the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). In

the Netherlands, following the 2002 election, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), List

Pim Fortuyn (PFL), and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) formed the

cabinet. Following the 2002 New Zealand elections, Labour and the Progressives formed the

cabinet and following the 2008 election, the National party formed a minority government.

After the 2007 Swiss elections, the Federal Council consisted of members of the Liberals

(FDP), Christian Democratic People’s Party (CVP), Social Democratic Party (SP), and Swiss

People’s Party (SVP) as it has for decades due to the ‘magic formula’ (cf., Ladner, 2001).

This variable is coded 1 if a person's vote choice is in the cabinet and 0 otherwise.

An individual's age is an approximate measure determined by subtracting the respondent's

birth year from the year of the survey; gender is coded 0 for female and 1 for male; education

is measured by reference to years of education in Austria and by level of education in the

Netherlands, New Zealand, and Switzerland, with higher values indicating a longer duration

or higher level of education; political interest is based on a question inquiring into how

interested in politics the respondent is, with higher values corresponding to greater interest.

Table A1 in appendix A provides a brief summary of the variables for each country.

The following analyses rely on datasets created using listwise deletion of missing data.

Appendix B reports analyses using data derived from multiple imputation by chained

equations (cf., Azur, Stuart, Frangakis, & Leaf, 2011; Royston & White, 2011; White,

Royston, & Wood, 2011).

Analysis

The data are analyzed separately for each country using ordinary least squares regression for

Austria, New Zealand and Switzerland and ordered logistic regression for the Netherlands.

The outputs of the regression analyses are displayed in Tables 2a, 2b, and 2c.

[INSERT TABLE 2 HERE]

Tables 2a and 2b display both the non-standardized and the standardized coefficients for the

OLS regression models – Austria, New Zealand and Switzerland. Table 2c displays the log

odds and the odds ratios for the ordered logistical regression – the Netherlands. Of the 5

cases, 4 demonstrate significant results for the relationship between perceived representation

and trust in parliament. In Austria, the difference between not believing one is represented

and believing one is represented predicts a 1.065 unit increase in the trust in parliament

variable, from just below the mean score of trust in parliament at 5.147 (all other variables

held at their mean), to just above the mean at 6.212; this corresponds to 0.413 standard

deviation change in trust in parliament, jumping from -0.253 standard deviations below the

mean to 0.161 standard deviations above. Of the variables included in the model, perceived

representation demonstrates the most substantial relationship (in terms of standardized

coefficients) with trust in parliament in Austria.

In the Netherlands, moving from not believing one is represented to believing one is

represented corresponds with a 0.417 unit increase in the ordered log-odds of reporting a

higher category of trust in parliament, or 1.517 times greater than the odds of reporting a

lower category. With the move from not believing one is represented to believing one is

represented, the probability of reporting “absolutely no trust” decreases from 0.022 to 0.014,

the probability of reporting “not so much trust” falls from 0.337 to 0.255, the probability of

reporting “fairly much trust” increases from 0.608 to 0.681, and the probability of reporting

“very much trust” increases from 0.033 to 0.049.

In New Zealand in 2002, the difference between not believing one is represented and

believing one is represented predicts a 0.248 unit increase in the trust in parliament variable,

from just below the mean score of trust in parliament at 4.172, to just above the mean at

4.420; this corresponds to 0.142 standard deviation change in trust in parliament, jumping

from -0.093 standard deviations below the mean to 0.049 standard deviations above. In terms

of relative impact, perceived representation lags behind all other significant variables save

gender.

In New Zealand in 2008, the difference between not believing one is represented and

believing one is represented corresponds with a 0.572 unit increase in the trust in parliament

variable, from just below the mean score of trust in parliament at 4.760, to just above the

mean at 5.333; this corresponds to 0.329 standard deviation change in trust in parliament,

jumping from -0.267 standard deviations below the mean to 0.062 standard deviations above.

For relative impact, perceived represented places third, behind education and political

interest.

For Switzerland, this relationship is neither statistically nor substantively significant. As

Switzerland is a fairly unique case among the four countries there are a number of reasons

this may be the case, be it the country’s federal design accommodating four linguistic/cultural

regions or the seven-member relatively-fixed multi-party executive.

Vote-congruence is a less consistent predictor of trust in parliament. This relationship attains

significance only in Austria and New Zealand in 2008. For these cases, perceived ideological

congruence with one’s vote choice independently and positively contributes to trust in

parliament above and beyond perceived representation, though it exerts less impact than

perceived representation.

The control variables, where they attain significance, act much as previous research leads us

to expect. However, of the control variables, only two, age and negative perception of the

economy, are consistently significantly related to trust in parliament. Age, though

consistently related to trust in parliament, varies the polarity of its relationship among

countries. In Austria and New Zealand, this variable is positively related to trust in

parliament, with older age cohorts more trusting of parliament. In the Netherlands and

Switzerland, this variable is negatively related to trust in parliament, with older cohorts less

trusting of parliament. A negative perception of the economy is consistently negatively

related to trust in parliament; a negative perception of the economy predicts less trust in

parliament.

Education, Left-Right identification, political interest, and surprisingly, even whether one is

an electoral winner are all only inconsistently related to trust in parliament. Education

achieves significance and is positively related to trust in parliament in Austria and New

Zealand; for Austria, a greater number of years in education predicts a higher level of trust in

parliament; for New Zealand, a higher level of education predicts a higher level of trust in

parliament. Left-Right identification achieves significance and is positively related to trust in

parliament in New Zealand in 2008 and in Switzerland and negatively related to trust in

parliament in the Netherlands; so whereas the those who identify with the Right are more

trusting of parliament in New Zealand in 2008 and Switzerland, those who identify with the

Left are more trusting of parliament in the Netherlands. Political interest achieves

significance only in Austria, the Netherlands, and in New Zealand in 2008 where it is

positively related to trust in parliament; those who are more interested in politics report a

higher level of trust in parliament.

Of the control variables, the most surprising result is that whether one voted for a party in

government, and thereby one of the dominant coalition in parliament, is not significantly

related to trust in parliament in the Netherlands and Switzerland. Plausible reasons for this

that are most apparent are the relatively consensual and fixed nature of the party composition

of the Swiss Federal Council (though, see Church, 2008) and the political turmoil following

the assassination of Pim Fortuyn (whose internally conflicted and controversial party, PFL,

formed part of the governing coalition following the 2002 election) during the 2002 election

campaign (cf., Pennings & Keman, 2003).

Similar to other research on individual levels of political trust (e.g., Bélanger & Nadeau,

2005; Bowler & Karp, 2004; Mishler & Rose, 2001), the models examined here do not

explain a great deal of the variance in the trust in parliament variable. Four of the models

explain less than 10% of the variance of trust in parliament, with those of the Netherlands and

Switzerland explaining less than even 5%. Austria is the exception, with the included

variables explaining slightly over 17% of the variance of trust in parliament.

Conclusion

Political trust, considered a normative good by many, impacts political attitudes and behavior

in a variety of ways, exerting a definitive impact on a country’s political climate. In seeking

to understand political attitudes and behavior we are thereby encouraged to also understand

political trust. This article looks at political trust, specifically trust in parliament, from the

perspective of the procedural justice literature.

The literature on procedural fairness provides decades of evidence that perceived voice in a

process increases individuals’ trust in the process and the institution responsible for the

process. Dunn (2012) extends this research into the political trust literature in an analysis of

the effect of electoral systems on individually-held levels of trust in parliament, finding that

voice in parliament (measured as the form and proportionality of the electoral system)

predicts greater trust in parliament. This research argues that an individual will trust

parliament more if the individual has a voice in that institution, but never directly measures

whether an individual perceives that he has a voice in parliament. This paper resolves this by

utilizing the concept of representation.

The proposition that democratic representatives should provide voice (i.e., the ability to

express one’s political preferences) to their constituents is common in political theory (e.g.,

Mansbridge, 2009; Mill, 1861; Urbinati, 2006; Williams, 1998) and is often echoed, at least

cursorily, in recent quantitative research (e.g., Blais & Bodet, 2006; Golder & Stramski,

2010; Pande, 2003; Powell, 2006). In this sense, this article equates voice with democratic

representation: an individual believes he is represented in parliament insofar as he believes

that a representative in parliament provides him the ability to express his political preferences

in the processes undertaken by parliament.

This train of reasoning leads me to predict that individuals will trust parliament more if they

believe they are represented in parliament. Making use of five electoral surveys of four

countries, this article tests whether believing one is represented by a party in parliament

corresponds with a higher level of political trust. In three of the four countries, and four of

the five cases (Austria 2009, the Netherlands 2002, New Zealand 2002, New Zealand 2008),

believing one is represented by a party in parliament does correspond with a higher level of

political trust. However, in Switzerland 2007, there is no significant relationship between

believing one is represented and trust in parliament. Though there is confirmation of this

relationship in four of the five cases studied, the absence of any relationship in 2007

Switzerland suggests caution. Nevertheless, there is certainly reason to suggest that, in

general, believing that one has a voice in parliament leads one to trust parliament more than

one otherwise would.

The standard warning one should keep in mind when looking at evidence derived from cross sectional data applies: these findings are correlational, even though the theory predicting

them indicates a causal relationship. Further, as the data analyzed here are also restricted to

only four countries, I cannot be sure of how these results will generalize to more culturally

divergent areas. There is some comfort in the numerous cultural, geographic, historical, and

institutional differences between the four countries. However, all of these countries are

advanced democracies and thereby limit generalization. More conclusive tests could be

derived from data allowing individual measurement of perceived representation and trust in

parliament over time and across a wider variety of countries.

Data limitations notwithstanding, this evidence indicates that for those hoping to increase

individuals’ trust in parliament, facilitating the perception that one is represented in

parliament appears a promising tactic. One possible method for doing this would be

increasing the proportionality of the electoral system (Golder & Stramski, 2010; Huber &

Powell, 1994; Powell, 2000, 2009), a method equated with increasing perceptions of voice in

parliamentary representation (Dunn, 2012; Mill, 1861). However, further evidence is

necessary to determine whether the results obtained here apply more broadly, whether

Switzerland in 2007 is an anomaly or indicative of a broader trend, and whether electoral

systems designed to deliver more proportional results do actually increase individual

perceptions of representation.
