Over the\n\npast two decades, an extensive literature has developed that seeks to identify the sources\n\nand determinants of institutional trust in East and Southeast Asia. While this literature has\n\nsolidified around several factors, for example, positive evaluations of economic\n\nperformance or anti-corruption efforts, there is still significant debate on the importance\n\nof others. This study seeks to contribute to this ongoing debate by testing the role of\n\ntraditionalism or traditional social values and partisanship. Utilizing data on 13 countries\n\nfrom Wave 4 of the Asian Barometer Survey and controlling for a range of commonly\n\nidentified determinants of institutional trust, this study uses regression analysis to test to\n\nwhat extent traditional social values and partisanship shape individual-level institutional\n\ntrust, both at the regional, aggregate level as well as on a country by country basis. While\n\ntraditional social values quite consistently display a positive, significant relationship with\n\ninstitutional trust, the role of partisanship is less consistent, varying from country to\n\ncountry.\n\niii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI would like to thank Dr. Timothy Rich, not only for his support and advice\n\nduring this project, but also for his guidance on a host of topics over the course of my\n\nundergraduate career.

What factors, if\n\nany, shape that level of trust? Are these levels of trust consistent across all governmental\n\ninstitutions and actors, or do they vary? On the surface, these types of questions tap into a\n\nrelatively simple concept - why and to what extent individuals trust their government.\n\nHowever, even a cursory glance at the academic literature on these topics, a literature\n\nconcerned with investigating the determinants and impacts of what is commonly termed\n\npolitical or institutional trust, reveals an incredibly complex and still-contentious field of\n\nstudy.\n\nWhy should we care about institutional trust? The reasons are many and varied.\n\nTo take just a few examples, while Grönlund and Setälä (2007) acknowledge the mixed\n\nresults found in the literature on the topic, using survey data from the 2002-2003\n\nEuropean Social Survey, they find that, even when controlling for a wide variety of\n\ndemographic and attitudinal variables, trust in parliament exerts a significant, positive\n\ninfluence on voter turnout at the regional level, and this relationship holds for eleven of\n\nthe twenty countries included in the survey. While it is certainly possible to debate the\n\nnormative aspect of whether increased levels of turnout are good or bad, this is an\n\nimportant outcome of institutional trust regardless.\n\nLooking at the impact of institutional trust from a different direction, Evers and\n\nGesthuizen (2011) investigate what impact institutional trust has on donation behavior,\n\nand they find that higher levels of individual-level institutional trust lead to increased\n\n2\n\nlevels of donations to what they term “activist” and “leisure” organizations, and higher\n\naggregate levels of individual trust at the country level, indicative of greater general faith\n\nin the institutions in those countries, leads to significantly lower levels of donations.\n\nIntriguingly, Hudson (2006), looking at EU data, makes the case that, when controlling\n\nfor a host of other factors, trust in several international institutions as well national\n\ngovernment, coded as a binary 0 or 1, has a significant and positive impact on levels of\n\nhappiness. While no means comprehensive, the impressive breadth of topics that these\n\nstudies cover, ranging from voter behavior to individual happiness, emphasizes the many\n\nconsequences of higher institutional trust. The practical importance of these effects\n\nsuggests a fuller understanding of both the determinants and implications of institutional\n\ntrust is warranted. It is on the former, the determinants of institutional trust, that I focus\n\nthis analysis.\n\nIn this work, I seek to contribute to this growing literature, specifically as it\n\nrelates to institutional trust in East and Southeast Asia, through the lenses of a few key\n\nquestions. One, for countries in East and Southeast Asia, what influences individual-level\n\ntrust in government? Two, are there certain approaches that more effectively explain\n\nlevels of individual-level institutional trust? And three, are there any broad\n\ngeneralizations that can be made about institutional trust in East and Southeast Asia, or\n\ndo the explanations about institutional trust vary from country to country? While I choose\n\nto focus more heavily on the determinants of institutional trust rather than the outcomes\n\nof institutional trust, this study joins a growing number of works looking at both aspects\n\nacross the globe. As Marien and Hooghe (2011) note, “In recent years, the topic [political\n\nor institutional trust] has attracted renewed attention in the scholarly literature as a\n\n3\n\nreaction to various studies documenting a structural decline in levels of political trust –\n\nmost notably in the United States,” (pg. 267). Moreover, this study seeks to contribute to\n\na growing regional literature on institutional trust, what Park (2017) identifies as the\n\nstudy of institutional trust in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nPark’s work also offers a few reasons as to why further attention deserves to be\n\npaid to the study of institutional trust in the Asia-Pacific more broadly and East and\n\nSoutheast Asia in particular. In brief, the region is one, “… of greater cultural and\n\nreligious diversity…” and, “… varies widely by the type of regime and mode of\n\ngovernance,” (Park 2017, pg. 488). While areas like Western Europe have some\n\ndiversity, the greater regional diversity of East and Southeast Asia permits studies of\n\ninstitutional trust to account for a wider variety of factors. For one example, Shi (2001)\n\nwas able to use the shared cultural background but wildly different regime types present\n\nin Taiwan and China to isolate the impact of cultural factors and regime types on\n\ninstitutional trust, something that would not have been possible in a region of well established democracies.\n\nAdditionally, the trends in overall levels of institutional trust that Marien and\n\nHooghe (2011) discuss are not as easily apparent in East and Southeast Asia. Looking at\n\ndata points from 17 different countries in the Asia-Pacific between 1996 and 2011, Park\n\n(2017) identifies four different patterns of fluctuations in institutional trust, only two of\n\nwhich appear to be trending downwards. If even the general trends of institutional trust in\n\nthe region do not fully mirror the global experience, it is especially important for further\n\nstudies to test whether commonly accepted determinants of institutional trust hold up to\n\nscrutiny when tested in East and Southeast Asia. While this question will be more fully\n\n4\n\nexplored in the literature review, one example of cause for such concern can be found in\n\na study by Kim (2005), who calls into question the relationship between institutional trust\n\nand social capital in South Korea, a relationship put forward and tested in Western\n\ncountries by scholars like Putnam. These types of studies should make us hesitant to\n\nblindly accept that such relationships are easily transferable from region to region.\n\nIn the following sections, I utilize data from Wave 4 of the Asian Barometer\n\nSurvey1, covering 14 countries in East and Southeast Asia and conducted between 2014\n\nand 2016, to investigate several potential determinants of institutional trust. I place\n\nparticular emphasis on the roles of traditional social values and partisanship, variables\n\nthat to date have received comparatively little attention in the wider literature. In the\n\nliterature review, I elaborate on two broad approaches to explaining levels of institutional\n\ntrust while also documenting and exploring the impacts of methodological\n\ninconsistencies in the literature on what conclusions can be drawn about institutional trust\n\nin the region. Additionally, it is from this analysis that I derive two hypotheses and\n\nidentify several variables that need to be tested in the later quantitative sections.\n\nFollowing this review of the literature, I include two quantitative chapters, each\n\nconsisting of a section detailing the data and methods used and a section detailing the\n\nresults of the analysis. While both chapters contain an array of independent variables, the\n\nfirst chapter specifically investigates the relationship between traditional social values\n\nand institutional trust while the second chapter focuses on partisanship. After this\n\n1 Data analyzed in this paper were collected by the Asian Barometer Project (2013-2016), which was codirected by Professors Fu Hu and Yun-han Chu and received major funding support from Taiwan’s Ministry of Education, Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University. The Asian Barometer Project Office (www.asianbarometer.org) is solely responsible for the data distribution. I appreciate the assistance in providing data by the institutes and individuals aforementioned. The views expressed herein are my own.\n\n5\n\nanalysis is complete, I conclude the paper with a reflection on the broad implications of\n\nthe results of the analysis and potential avenues for future research.\n\n6\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES\n\nAn analysis of the literature surrounding individual-level institutional trust in East\n\nand Southeast Asia reveals a substantial amount of internal debate. In this literature\n\nreview, I provide an overview of two of the major debates observable in the literature.\n\nThe first is somewhat more explicitly methodological in nature. When discussing\n\nindividual-level trust in government, which parts of government and other institutions are\n\nbeing referred to? I argue that the literature takes two broad approaches to this topic, and,\n\nimportantly, an analysis of these two approaches suggests that this methodological\n\ndistinction appears to have meaningful implications for analysis on what factors influence\n\ninstitutional trust. Second, I provide an overview of the main debate in the literature, that\n\nbeing which factors are the key determinants of individuals’ trust in government. This\n\nsection includes not only a listing of competing explanations but also attempts to assess\n\nthe extent to which the current literature supports said explanations, and in which areas\n\nthe literature could be improved or further developed.\n\nMethodological Distinctions\n\nBeginning with the first debate, a review of the relevant literature produces two\n\nrelatively clear trends in terms of which institutions authors utilize to test determinants of\n\nindividual-level trust in government. First, a portion of the literature largely limits its\n\nanalysis to a subset of institutions. For example, Kim (2005), in a study that looks at\n\npolitical trust in South Korea, limits his analysis to parliament and political parties. Wang\n\n(2013) utilizes two different sets of institutions when measuring political trust in China,\n\n7\n\nSouth Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, first looking at the presidency or prime minister as well\n\nas the national government and then later looking at trust in the central and the local\n\ngovernment levels. Similarly, Park (2017) limits his regression analysis of institutional\n\ntrust to an indexed score utilizing responses to questions about trust in the national\n\ngovernment and parliament. What is particularly worth noting is that both Wang (2013)\n\nand Park (2017) utilize various waves of Asian Barometer data, which offers trust data on\n\na large suite of institutions ranging from the national government, to courts, to the police,\n\nto the armed forces, to the media, and Park (2017) even includes much of this data in a\n\ndescriptive discussion of trends in trust in East Asia before focusing in only two\n\ncategories to conduct further analysis.\n\nBy contrast, another subset of the literature employs a much more broad-based\n\napproach to the topic. For example, Zhai (2016), in his analysis of institutional trust in\n\nChina, not only includes a greater list of institutions by looking at parliament, political\n\nparties, the national government, and courts, but he also includes trust in governmental\n\nofficials as another avenue of analysis, while Tang (2011) extends this further, adding the\n\npresidency, the civil service, the military, the police, and local government to his models.\n\nIn summary, at the methodological level, there is broad variance from study to study as to\n\nwhich institutions are considered when attempting to statistically test the determinants of\n\npolitical trust, and these differences persist despite the availability of data concerning\n\nmuch a more expansive set of institutions.\n\nJustifications as to why some studies select a small battery of institutions while\n\nothers work with a much more holistic one vary. One justification for the selection of\n\nparliament and political parties as the only institutions simply asserts that trust in\n\n8\n\nparliament is the best measure available because parliament is preeminent in a\n\nrepresentative system (Kim 2005). Sometimes the explanations are not fully developed.\n\nFor example, the extent to which Park (2017) discusses why an index of only trust in\n\nnational government and parliament is used to conducted regression analysis is limited to\n\na brief statement that they are the, “… political branches of government,” (pg. 501).\n\nHowever, there are studies that limit their selection of institutions while more fully\n\ndeveloping their reasoning. Chi and Kwon (2016), when looking at the impact of\n\nperceived inequality on trust in Taiwan and South Korea borrow from Mishler and Rose\n\n(2001) and Chang and Chu (2006), limiting themselves to a list of six institutions. Chang\n\nand Chu (2006) themselves, when looking at the relationship between corruption and\n\npolitical trust in East Asia, borrow the framework from Mishler and Rose (2001). Mishler\n\nand Rose (2001), in a study of trust of 10 post-Communist countries in Eurasia, base their\n\ndecision to limit themselves to six institutions (parliament, the prime minister/president,\n\ncourts, police, political parties, and the military) out of an original list of 11 due to\n\nanalysis that found those institutions accounted for the lion’s share of variance in trust,\n\nand they additionally note that repeating their analysis with all 11 institutions results in\n\nno meaningful change in results. While it would have been potentially worthwhile to see\n\neither Chang and Chu (2006) or Chi and Kwon (2016) repeat the analysis that led to such\n\na decision to limit the range of institutions with new data sets in a new region, but the\n\nlogic used to arrive at this decision is easy to follow.\n\nImportantly, the literature suggests that differences in which institutions are\n\nincluded in the analysis have an impact on the results. One way in which this materializes\n\ncan be seen in the work of Tang and Huhe (2016), who find that decentralization has a\n\n9\n\nstatistically significant impact on political trust, but the direction of this relationship is\n\ndifferent depending on whether local or national trust is being measured and whether the\n\nregime is authoritarian or democratic. In particular, in authoritarian regimes\n\ndecentralization has a negative impact on local trust and a positive impact on national\n\ntrust, whereas decentralization leads to a significant, positive increase in local trust in\n\ndemocracies and loses significance at the national level (Tang and Huhe 2016).\n\nDisregarding for the moment the differences based on regime type, just the differences in\n\nthe way that decentralization influences trust when looking at local government versus\n\nnational government suggests a greater need to carefully consider what institutions\n\nresearchers choose to study in future research.\n\nA study by Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) also highlights potential consequences of\n\nonly using a small battery of institutions in measurements of trust, as they find that\n\npartisanship does not equally impact trust in all institutions. Instead, they find that trust in\n\nwhat they term “partisan institutions” like the president or prime minister and parliament\n\nis more strongly impacted by partisanship than in “neutral institutions” like the civil\n\nservice and the military. While Park (2017) measures whether respondents voted for the\n\nwinner or loser the last election, and Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) measure partisanship\n\nexplicitly as identification with the party in power or with opposition parties, Park\n\nconcludes that the partisan bias quantified by this winner/loser split does not have an\n\nimpact in Mongolia for political trust measured with two institutions, whereas Huang,\n\nLee, and Lin find a significant relationship between partisanship and trust in Mongolia\n\nfor a subset of the institutions they measure. While some of this difference may be in how\n\npartisanship is being measured, the design of Park’s study prevents this question from\n\n10\n\nbeing answered by not considering a wider variety of institutions. Finally, Yang and Tang\n\n(2010) look at a set of 13 political institutions in China and utilize factor analysis to\n\ndivide them into administrative, legal, and societal categories, and they find that a variety\n\nof potential determinants of individual trust in institutions have different effects\n\ndepending on the category of institution under discussion. Altogether, the findings in\n\nthese studies and the different conclusion reached by Park and Huang, Lee, and Lin’s\n\nreinforce the notion that there are differences in the determinants of political trust across\n\na wide range of institutions, and a failure to include a wider range of institutions when\n\ntesting institutional trust has the potential to generate conclusions that do not accurately\n\nreflect the full complexity of the factors that impact institutional trust in East and\n\nSoutheast Asia.\n\nDebates on the Determinants of Institutional Trust\n\nThe second major debate in the literature centers around which factors best\n\nexplain individual-level institutional trust in East and Southeast Asia. While there are\n\nvarious ways one might categorize potential determinants, this paper utilizes a framework\n\nput forward by a number of studies (e.g. Wong, Wan, and Hsiao 2011; Tang 2011; Zhai\n\n2016; Wang 2013; Yang and Tang 2010; Mishler and Rose 2001; Ma and Yang 2014),\n\ndividing approaches into two large categories: institutional approaches and cultural\n\napproaches. To elaborate more, Wong, Wan, and Hsiao (2011) borrow from Mishler and\n\nRose (2001) in splitting up the relevant literature between institutional and cultural\n\napproaches, and in their review of the relevant literature they argue that the institutional\n\napproach centers around rational evaluations of the performance of government. When\n\ntesting the institutional approach, the authors measure such a rational evaluation via\n\n11\n\neconomic performance, as represented by handling of the economy and unemployment,\n\nand political performance, as represented by views governmental handling of political\n\ncorruption and human rights issues. There appears to be in the literature a broad-based\n\nagreement on at least some of the factors that fall under the institutional approach, as\n\nnumerous studies (e.g. Tang 2011; Huang, Lee, and Lin 2013; Wang 2013; Shi 2001)\n\nincorporate measures designed to capture economic performance and/or issues with\n\ncorruption.\n\nHowever, this is not the only way in which studies have attempted to measure\n\nevaluations of governmental performance. Mujani and Liddle (2013) utilize an index\n\nconsisting of responses to five questions such as satisfaction with the current government,\n\nlikeliness of the government to solve what respondents viewed as a serious problem, ease\n\nof access to services like help from the police, and so on, focusing on these types of\n\nissues in addition to questions regarding economic performance rather than topics like\n\ncorruption. Park (2017) also employs a slightly different approach, creating categories of\n\npolicy performance, including economic performance, security, and anti-poverty efforts,\n\nand process performance, measured by a sub-set of topics related to rule of law. The\n\nbenefit of this type of approach is that it allows for analysis to tease out further details\n\nabout which factors shape individual-level trust institutional trust and to control for\n\npotential competing explanations. For example, returning to the topic of economic\n\nperformance as a determinant of trust, Park (2017) finds that views on the national\n\neconomy are much better predictors of political trust in East Asia than perceptions of the\n\nrespondent’s own economic situation. These varying approaches showcase that, even\n\nwith a general agreement in the literature on these important aspects of the institutional\n\n12\n\napproach, the constituent methods used to measure such performance can vary to some\n\nextent from study to study. And, small variations in the methods used can help contribute\n\nto a greater overall understanding of the institutional factors that shape institutional trust.\n\nMoreover, there are several potential determinants analyzed in the literature that\n\nmight not fit entirely with the definition of institutional trust provided by Wong, Wan,\n\nand Hsiao (2011), but might fit under an expanded definition. First, both Park (2017) and\n\nHuang, Lee, and Lin (2013) incorporate media exposure as a potential determinant of\n\ntrust, something seen as a significant, negative determinant of trust in portions of the\n\nAfrican literature (Hutchison 2011; Hutchison and Johnson 2011), and Huang, Lee, and\n\nLin explicitly include it in an evaluation of governmental performance while Park lists it\n\nas an alternative explanation. However, the findings of these two papers provide slightly\n\ndifferent results. Both Park (2017) and Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) utilize Asian\n\nBarometer Survey data to measure the impact of media exposure, although Park utilizes a\n\ncombination of waves 1, 2, and 3 of the ABS as available and Huang, Lee, and Lin limit\n\ntheir analysis to the wave 3 data. Both studies use different sets of additional variables as\n\ncontrols and independent variables, and the question used within these surveys simply\n\nasks how often respondents view news about government or politics.\n\nHuang, Lee, and Lin (2013), when looking at Korea, Taiwan, Mongolia, the\n\nPhilippines, Thailand, and Indonesia, find that only in Korea is there a significant,\n\nnegative impact of media consumption on institutional trust that persists in a generalized\n\nanalysis of institutional trust as well as when controlling for partisan versus neutral\n\ninstitutions, although in the Philippines there is a significant, positive influence on trust in\n\nneutral institutions. Park (2017), in a battery of ten countries, including all six countries\n\n13\n\ntested by the aforementioned paper, measures trust only in national government and\n\nparliament, and finds a significant effect for media exposure in the Philippines and\n\nCambodia. It is difficult to ascertain what, exactly, is driving this difference in findings. It\n\nmay be that the limited range of institutions that make up the trust measure in Park’s\n\npaper leads to differing conclusions, but in the Asian context media exposure appears to\n\nbe a comparatively unreliable determinant of institutional trust as it is only significant in\n\na small number of countries.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that there are potential concerns about using such a\n\nsimple measure of media exposure. For example, Ceron (2015) utilizes data from 27\n\ncountries in the Eurobarometer survey dataset to investigate the impact on institutional\n\ntrust, indexed as trust in the national government, regional and local governments,\n\nparliament, and political parties, of exposure to different types of news media,\n\nparticularly government and traditional media websites versus social media. Ceron\n\n(2015) finds that higher rates of social media news consumption decrease trust, while\n\nsuch consumption from governmental and traditional media websites actually increases\n\ntrust. Moreover, in testing the impact on trust of news consumption from non-web-based\n\nsources, press and radio news consumption significantly increased trust, while TV news\n\nhad no effect (Ceron 2015).\n\nApplying these findings to the East and Southeast Asian context, then, it raises the\n\npotential that either the data available through the Asian Barometer Survey is simply not\n\ndetailed enough to accurately test more nuanced relationships or that the analyses\n\nthemselves are not nuanced enough. Luckily, a study by Wu (2014) looking at trust of the\n\ncourts and police in China and Taiwan utilizes second wave ABS data to measure the\n\n14\n\nimpact of varying forms of media consumption and highlights that it is possible to control\n\nfor the amount of Internet use among respondents as well as whether they utilize\n\ntelevision or newspapers as their primary source of information. The results are again\n\nsomewhat inconclusive, with the only significant relationship between types of media\n\nconsumption and trust in the police/courts being that in China those who consumed\n\nforeign news were less likely to trust these two institutions (Wu 2014). But the\n\nmethodology utilized in the study suggests that it is possible to in more detail analyze the\n\nimpact of media exposure on various institutions in the region with available data. And, it\n\nwould be of benefit to the literature to do so, if only to more firmly demonstrate the\n\ninconsistent relationship between media exposure and institutional trust.\n\nSimilarly, there is some discussion in the relevant literature on the role of\n\ngovernment type and electoral systems. Tang and Huhe (2016) find that whether a\n\ncountry is a democracy or autocracy, measured either on a dichotomous scale or via\n\nPolity’s index, has an important interaction effect when it comes to measuring the impact\n\nof decentralization on political trust. This suggests that the generalized type of\n\ngovernment a country operates under, while not directly impacting individual trust, may\n\nstill need to be incorporated into models to control for any potential interactions with\n\nother variables. Focusing on a slightly different area, Park (2017) notes differences in the\n\ninfluence of winning or losing the last election on trust in both competitive authoritarian\n\nand electoral systems, arguing that electoral systems that disproportionately create losers\n\nhave a larger influence on changes in institutional trust.\n\nUnfortunately, there appears to be comparatively little literature focused on East\n\nand Southeast Asia that explicitly analyzes the differences between different electoral\n\n15\n\nsystems or electoral outcomes, although literature from outside the region suggests some\n\nways in which the topic might be approached. For example, Cho (2012) conducts a study\n\nof 16 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, seeking to test to what extent differences in\n\nelectoral systems, particularly majoritarian versus proportional representation systems,\n\ninfluence political trust in the legislatures of those countries. Conducting a multi-level\n\nanalysis and controlling for factors including election quality, economic conditions,\n\nwinner/loser divide, demographic variables, and so on, feelings of accountability towards\n\nlegislators had no significant impact on trust whereas feelings of representation had a\n\nsignificant, positive impact on trust (Cho 2012). Accountability played no greater role in\n\nmajoritarian systems than PR systems, and PR systems were significantly more able to\n\ntranslate feelings of representation into trust as compared to majoritarian systems (Cho\n\n2012). At a minimum, these findings suggest that in some regions differences in electoral\n\nsystems have a wider sphere of influence than only the relationship between the\n\nwinner/loser divide and institutional trust, and it would benefit the East and Southeast\n\nAsian literature to pursue this direction moving forward.\n\nLooking at the topic from a different angle, Marien (2011) utilizes data from\n\nEurope and focuses not on the type of electoral system being utilized by a country but\n\ninstead the impact of overall proportionality of the outcomes on political trust in\n\nparliament, politicians, and political parties. Controlling, for various demographic\n\nvariables, institutional performance, the winner/loser divide, good governance, the age of\n\nthe regime, and GDP per capita, Marien (2011) finds a curvilinear relationship between\n\ninstitutional trust and proportionality; very proportional and very disproportional election\n\noutcomes both lead to significant, positive increases in trust, which she suggests would\n\n16\n\nexplain why previous empirical analyses have, when attempting to model this\n\nrelationship linearly, found contradictory results on the impact of proportionality on\n\npolitical trust. Again, however, a review of the East and Southeast Asian literature on\n\ntrust did not turn up studies that have attempted to apply this process to the region, which\n\nsuggests yet another way forward that could help expand on the impact of electoral\n\nsystems on political trust in the region. Altogether, although the role of electoral systems\n\nmay be a factor that does not explicitly fall under a restrictive definition of the\n\ninstitutional approach, it seems reasonable to include it under a discussion of the\n\ninstitutional approach expanded to incorporate the impact of the structural design of\n\ngovernmental systems.\n\nReturning to the other half of this debate, Wong, Wan, and Hsiao (2011) define\n\nthe cultural approach to understanding institutional trust as one that acknowledges the\n\nimpact of unique cultural backgrounds, noting that these backgrounds can influence the\n\nway in which people might otherwise rationally evaluate the performance of their\n\ngovernment. One commonly tested method that the literature suggests may explain the\n\nway in which the cultural background of a person might influence trust is Putnam’s social\n\ncapital theory, which several studies (e.g. Kim 2005; Wang 2013; Huang, Lee, and Lin\n\n2013) break down into social trust and civic engagement. On this topic, Huang, Lee, and\n\nLin (2013) conclude that social trust is a better explanatory variable than civic\n\nengagement when controlling for other factors such as economic performance and\n\npartisanship. Perhaps due to similar sentiments among other researchers, social trust has\n\nalso found application in several studies separate from civic engagement (e.g. Mujani and\n\nLiddle 2013; Tang 2011; Park 2017) but there appears to be significant variation between\n\n17\n\nstudies that incorporate social trust, or even both social trust and civic engagement, as to\n\nwhether it is a significant determinant of individual institutional trust in all cases.\n\nTo look further into this variation, it is helpful to focus on several studies with\n\ndiffering results. Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013), Park (2017), and Wang (2013) all\n\noperationalize social trust in the same way, utilizing a dichotomous variable indicating\n\nwhether respondents feel that other people can, generally, be trusted, but each study uses\n\ndifferent controls, different countries, different institutions that make up its institutional\n\ntrust measure, and different combinations of waves of the Asian Barometer Survey data.\n\nAnd, potentially due to these differences, the conclusions that these three studies draw\n\nexperience noticeable variation. Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) find that social trust is a\n\nsignificant, positive determinant of institutional trust for at least one subset of institutions\n\nthey analyze, with institutions being grouped into partisan and neutral categories in\n\naddition to a general trust score, in all six countries - Korea, Taiwan, Mongolia,\n\nPhilippines, Thailand, and Indonesia - they study. Park (2017) adds an additional four\n\ncountries, for example, Japan, to those used in Huang, Lee, and Lin’s study, and he finds\n\nthat for only three countries of the 10 studied – South Korea, Mongolia, and Indonesia does social trust have a significant impact on institutional trust, and it is positive in each\n\ncase. While there is some agreement here, then, the two studies find diverging\n\nconclusions on Taiwan, the Philippines, and Thailand. Finally, Wang (2013) finds that\n\nsocial trust has a significant, positive impact on institutional trust in an aggregate data set\n\nfrom Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, but upon disaggregating this data down to the\n\ncountry level the relationship remains only in South Korea. What these disparate results\n\nsuggest is that, even when a variable like social trust is being operationalized in the same\n\n18\n\nway, studies manage to find contradictory results that call into question which finding is\n\ncorrect.\n\nMoreover, due to the lack of a consensus as to which index to use for institutional\n\ntrust, which controls to incorporate in an analysis, and which years of survey data to\n\ninclude, there is no immediately available way such comparisons might be made. This\n\nissue is further compounded by the fact that Mujani and Liddle (2013) operationalize\n\nsocial trust differently, creating an index from responses to five questions rather than\n\nrelying on a single dichotomous variable, and conclude that social trust has a significant,\n\npositive impact on institutional trust across all seven countries they study. If comparing\n\nthis study to only one of the three mentioned above, one might simply suggest that\n\nvariance in how studies measure social trust is the issue. But, these contradictory results,\n\nboth with and without contradictions in this area, suggest that studies sharing at a\n\nminimum more than one methodological feature are necessary to resolve these issues.\n\nFinally, a not-insignificant amount of discussion has been dedicated to what\n\nextent traditionalism or traditional values play in shaping political trust. Wong, Wan, and\n\nHsiao (2011) found no significant relationship between traditionalism and institutional\n\ntrust, but their measure of traditionalism centered around the superiority of one’s\n\ntraditional culture over another. By contrast, a number of studies, both looking at China\n\nin particular (e.g. Yang and Tang 2010; Zhai 2016) or in multi-country studies (e.g. Shi\n\n2001; Tang 2011; Ikeda 2013) have put forward the argument that some form of what is\n\noften called traditional social values, placing an emphasis on topics like attitudes towards\n\nhierarchy derived from the historical context of the East and Southeast Asian region,\n\ncontribute to levels of political trust in the region. To borrow one explicit definition,\n\n19\n\nIkeda (2013) argues that, “This measure [the traditional social values measure] reflects\n\n‘social values’ in daily social settings and positive attitudes toward paternalism, harmony\n\norientation, and collectivism,” (pg. 20).\n\nLooking at the China-focused studies first, Yang and Tang (2010) look at trust in\n\na battery of 13 different institutions, utilizing factor analysis to group them into\n\nadministrative, legal, and societal categories. Yang and Tang (2010) narrow down their\n\nmeasure of traditional values to one category closely associated with Confucian\n\ntraditions, attitudes towards hierarchy, and find that when controlling for other variables\n\nrelated to modernization, government performance, and the impact of mobilization efforts\n\nby the Chinese government, this measure of traditional values leads to a significant,\n\npositive increase in trust across all categories of institutions. Zhai (2016), however, takes\n\na broader view of the topic, suggesting that although traditional values in China can be\n\nlinked not only to Confucianism, but other religious and quasi-religious traditions like\n\nDaoism and Buddhism, it is possible to quantify these attitudes with a set of 11 questions\n\nand then sub-divide them into categories of family, social, and political values. Zhai\n\n(2016) finds that traditional social and traditional political values have a significant,\n\npositive impact on trust in both institutions (parliament, parties, the national government,\n\nand courts) and governmental officials, while traditional family values maintained this\n\nrelationship only for officials. Altogether, these findings suggest that despite broad\n\ndifferences in the range of interpretation of traditional values, the operationalization of\n\nthis interpretation, and differing sets of institutions, at least in the case of China,\n\ntraditional social values are meaningful determinants of political trust.\n\n20\n\nIn cross-country comparison studies, the impact of traditional social values on\n\ninstitutional trust is inconsistent, and it, unfortunately, marks a return to the types of\n\nissues found in a number of studies utilizing social trust. Tang (2011), measuring\n\ntraditional social values via six questions broadly related to attitudes towards authority,\n\nviews on conflict, and collective wellbeing, finds a positive relationship between this\n\nvariable and institutional trust across the region, but there is no available regression-style\n\nanalysis of this relationship present in the study. Due to the lack of such an analysis, and\n\nthe subsequent commentary on the strength of the relationship relative to other factors, it\n\nis difficult to rely on that conclusion. By contrast, Wang (2013) finds that in Japan,\n\nSouth Korea, and Taiwan, traditional social values, as measured with a battery of three\n\nquestions, do not significantly influence political trust. But Ikeda (2013), looking at an\n\naggregate data set of individuals from 11 countries in East and Southeast Asia finds that\n\ntraditional social values have a significant, positive impact on political trust at the\n\nindividual level, if not at the country level. What is to be made of these differences?\n\nAgain, Ikeda (2013) and Wang (2013) utilize different waves of Asian Barometer Data,\n\noperationalize the measure via different methods, not only in that Ikeda uses a more\n\nexpansive battery of questions but that the phrasing of many questions themselves\n\nchanged from Wave 2 to Wave 3 of the ABS, and differ in the controls used, all of which\n\nhas the potential to cause the observed differences. In much the same way that the area of\n\nsocial trust likely requires a convergence on methodology in order to come to more firm\n\nconclusions about the role it plays in shaping political trust in East and Southeast Asia,\n\nsuch convergence will likely be necessary for the role of traditional social values.\n\n21\n\nIn a more general sense, what conclusions can we draw from the wider literature?\n\nFirst, while the claim that the institutional approach to understanding institutional trust is\n\nsuperior (e.g. Wong, Wan, and Hsiao 2011; Park 2017) may be premature, the assertion\n\nthat “… national economic well-being and control of corruption play the most consistent\n\nrole in determining political trust…” (Park 2017 pg. 503) is harder to dispute. Studies by\n\nPark (2017), Wong, Wan, and Hsiao (2011), Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013), Tang and Huhe\n\n(2016), and Wang (2013) all examine more than one country utilizing various\n\nmethodological frameworks and find perceptions of corruption and economic\n\nperformance are, generally, significant determinants of institutional trust. In other words,\n\nthe consistent, significant presence of these measures across studies, apparent even\n\ndespite differences in methodology, is a comparative rarity in the literature and therefore\n\na meaningful reason to target a policy at one of these two areas if the goal of a policy\n\nproposal is to be applicable in as many contexts as possible. Wang (2013) provides\n\nfurther justification to focus on corruption, as he finds the positive impact on trust of\n\nincreased evaluations of governmental performance is limited to a large extent when a\n\nperson has concerns about corruption.\n\nBecause of the consistency associated with the institutional approach across the\n\nwider literature, I will focus less on this approach to understanding institutional trust in\n\nthis study. I will still control for such variables in my analysis, but in an effort to provide\n\na greater contribution to the literature, I choose to on areas of continued debate. For this\n\nreason, more focus will be paid to understanding specific aspects of the cultural approach\n\nto institutional trust.\n\n22\n\nSecond, one issue that repeatedly surfaces in the wider literature is a lack of\n\nmethodological consistency, an issue that likely needs to be resolved moving forward.\n\nHow to begin to resolve this issue, however, is a difficult question. Not only are there\n\nserious differences in methodology associated with meaningful differences in conclusions\n\nnot only in the battery of institutions utilized to create a measure of political trust, as the\n\ndiscussion in the first debate highlights, but also as it relates to determinants of\n\ninstitutional trust themselves. Any suggestions aimed at correcting these methodological\n\ndifferences, then, should target at least one of these areas.\n\nIt is my recommendation that, in an effort to begin to address such\n\nmethodological inconsistencies, it would be beneficial to come to an agreement on a\n\nminimum battery of institutions to include in any index of institutional trust. At a\n\nminimum, the justifications utilized by Mishler and Rose (2001) and then implemented in\n\nseveral other studies (Chang and Chu 2006; Chi and Kwon 2016), wherein the battery of\n\ninstitutions consists of parliament, the prime minister/president, police, the military,\n\ncourts, and the police, provide an acceptable baseline. This is not to suggest that there be\n\nno flexibility in terms of grouping institutions for analysis. But it is important that such\n\ndecisions are made with sound reasoning behind them, as done with statistical\n\njustification by Yang and Tang (2010), in order to tap into a theme that non-grouped\n\ninstitutions could not, as done by Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) for partisanship, or due to\n\ndata restrictions. Moving forward into the quantitative analysis chapters, I will attempt to\n\nconsistently utilize such a broader definition of institutional trust.\n\nKeeping these conclusions in mind, and cognizant of the vast number of potential\n\navenues by which to investigate the determinants of institutional trust, I choose to narrow\n\n23\n\nmy focus down to three key topics, two of which I develop into hypotheses and one\n\nwhich, while not a hypothesis, I still devote a portion of the analysis to. First, using Wave\n\n4 data from the Asian Barometer Survey, what is the relationship between traditional\n\nsocial values and institutional trust at the regional and country-level in East and Southeast\n\nAsia? Second, can we attribute the inconsistent results associated with measures of social\n\ncapital to differences in the operationalization of variables? And third, building on the\n\nwork of Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013), what is the relationship between partisanship and\n\ninstitutional trust when controlling for a wider number of additional variables, including\n\ntraditional social values? Keeping in mind the relevant discussion of the current state of\n\nthe literature on these topics, I put forward the following hypotheses:\n\nHypothesis 1: Controlling for other factors, traditional social values should positively\n\ncorrelate with institutional trust.\n\nHypothesis 2: Controlling for other factors, voting for the winning party of the last\n\nelection should positively correlate with institutional trust. The magnitude of this\n\nrelationship should be diminished for non-partisan institutions.\n\n24\n\nINSTITUTIONAL TRUST AND TRADITIONAL SOCIAL VALUES\n\nData and Methods\n\nThis project utilizes data from the 4th Wave of the Asian Barometer Survey\n\n(ABS), which contains survey results from 14 different countries and territories in East\n\nand Southeast Asia (Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, China, Mongolia, the Philippines,\n\nTaiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar).\n\nThe surveys constituting the 4th Wave of the ABS were conducted between 2014 and\n\n20162, and sample sizes for each individual country range from approximately 1,000\n\nrespondents to as many as 4,000, with a regional sample size of 19,467. Of interest for\n\nthis research project, the ABS survey provides a relatively holistic battery of questions\n\nsuitable for an investigation into the potential determinants of institutional trust. Not only\n\ndoes the ABS survey contain a battery of questions designed to measure trust in 13\n\ndifferent political and non-political institutions, but it also has sections dedicated to voter\n\nbehavior, social trust and social capital, views on governmental performance,\n\ntraditionalism, and so on. It should be noted, however, that due to certain restrictions on\n\nthe questions asked in a subset of the 4th Wave countries, particularly as it relates to\n\nquestions on trust in various institutions, there is some limit to the extent that cross national comparisons can be made.\n\n2 Surveys in each country were conducted in the following time periods: Taiwan – June through November 2014; Singapore - October through December 2014; Philippines – July 2014; Mongolia – June through August 2014; Thailand – August through October 2014; Malaysia – September through November 2014; China – December 2014 through June 2016; Myanmar – January through March 2015; Indonesia – January 2016; Vietnam – September through October 2015; Hong Kong – February through April 2016; Japan – March 2016; South Korea – October through December 2015; Cambodia October through November 2015.\n\n25\n\nDependent Variable\n\nOne of the most important methodological decisions in this project is what\n\nmethod to use to operationalize institutional trust. As highlighted in the literature review,\n\nthere are a wide array of methods used in the relevant literature, many of them with their\n\nown potential benefits and issues. However, in line with my prior observations about the\n\ncurrent state of the literature, any method must fulfill two major criteria:\n\n1. The method used should be applicable to as many countries in the dataset as\n\npossible. This will not only allow for country-to-country comparisons to\n\ndetermine whether the models developed in this paper work equally well in each\n\ncountry contained in the sample, but it will also provide the most latitude for\n\nfuture research on the topic to be compared against the results found in this paper.\n\n2. The method should incorporate a relatively broad set of institutions into its\n\nmeasurement of institutional trust. The review of the relevant literature suggests\n\nthat such choices matter, and studies that limit a definition of institutional trust to\n\nonly a small subset of institutions investigated in the ABS survey risk missing\n\nvaluable insights into the determinants of institutional trust.\n\nUnfortunately, any operationalization method that attempts to fulfill both criteria\n\nimmediately runs into several issues. First, although the 4th Wave ABS Survey contains\n\nquestions on a battery of 13 separate institutions3, due to issues such as structural\n\ndifferences between the 14 countries included in the survey, questions on trust in the\n\n3 The full list includes: The president or prime minister, the courts, the national government located in the capital city, political parties, parliament, the civil service, the military or armed forces, the police, the local government, newspapers, television, the election commission, and NGOs. The election commission and NGOs are listed as optional questions in the survey.\n\n26\n\nexecutive office, political parties, local government, the election commission, and NGOs\n\nare not asked in at least one country. As some of these, particularly institutions like the\n\nexecutive office, seem quite relevant to a comprehensive measure of institutional trust,\n\nthis presents potential issues in attempts to create a model that works for every country in\n\nthe sample. Second, respondents in Vietnam were not presented the same answer choices\n\nfor the institutional trust questions as the rest of the sample. Respondents in every\n\ncountry except Vietnam were presented with a 4-point Likert scale asking them to\n\nindicate how much they trust each institution, ranging from “A great deal of trust” to\n\n“None at all”, as well as options such as declining to answer. In Vietnam, however,\n\nrespondents have only three answers to indicate their level of trust: “A great deal of\n\ntrust,” “Quite a lot of trust,” or “Some trust.” This means that it is impossible to directly\n\ncompare Vietnam to the rest of the sample, and because of this I choose to exclude\n\nVietnam from the analysis entirely.\n\nFrom there, I create two distinct indexes of institutional trust, Trust Index 1 to\n\napply to all 13 remaining countries in the sample and Trust Index 2 to apply to a nine country subset, the countries where questions about all of the institutions composing\n\nTrust Index 2 were asked. The former utilizes only those questions pertaining to\n\ninstitutions that were asked about in every country in the set and so excludes questions\n\nregarding the executive branch of government, local government, political parties, the\n\nelection commission, and NGOs. Additionally, while there is likely some value in\n\nknowing to what extent respondents trust T.V. and newspapers as sources of information,\n\nI choose to not include these institutions in my indexed measure as they in many cases\n\nare not explicitly political groups, a government branch, or otherwise a governmental\n\n27\n\norgan. As such, the first institutional trust index only contains respondents’ evaluations of\n\nthe courts, the national government, parliament, the civil service, the military, and the\n\npolice.\n\nHowever, in order to have a measure that incorporates other important organs of\n\ngovernment like the executive office, I also choose to create a second index including\n\nevaluations of all possible institutions excluding newspapers, television, and NGOs.\n\nWhile this index applies to only nine countries in the set4 and necessitates running a\n\nsecond set of models, this is the best compromise available between a model that\n\nincorporates and allows comparisons between as many countries as possible and a model\n\nthat does not exclude potentially important institutions from its operationalization of\n\ninstitutional trust.5 The first model, applicable to all 13 countries, will permit a full,\n\nregional comparison, whereas the second model with allow for a more comprehensive\n\ndefinition of institutional trust to be tested on a subset of countries. Moreover, at least for\n\nthe nine countries present in both sets of data, I will be able to directly compare the two\n\nmodels to analyze what impact defining the dependent variable of analysis more\n\ncomprehensively has on the regression results.\n\nIndependent Variables\n\nThe various independent variables in this study draw heavily from prior literature\n\non the topic of institutional trust in East and Southeast Asia. First, in line with most of the\n\n4 China, Singapore, Indonesia, and Hong Kong all fail to ask at least questions regarding at least one of the 10 institutions (The executive office, courts, national government, political parties, parliament, the civil service, the military, the police, the local government, and the election commission) included in this second index. 5 While there are slight variations in the mean level of trust as measured by Trust Index 1 and Trust Index 2 for the nine countries for which the two measures are applicable, this variance is in each case less than .1\n\n28\n\nprevious literature, this project attempts to capture the impact of the evaluation of\n\ngovernmental performance on institutional trust via a question on respondents’ views of\n\nthe current economic situation in their country. To measure this, I use Question 1 of the\n\n4th Wave ABS Survey, which reads, “How would you rate the overall economic condition\n\nof our country today?” utilizes a 5-point Likert scale ranging from very good (1) to very\n\nbad (5), which I recoded as very bad (1) to very good (5). Additionally, in line with\n\nworks such as Park (2017), I also choose to include Question 4 of the ABS Survey, “As\n\nfor your own family, how do you rate the economic situation of your family today,” in\n\norder to account for any potential difference in a respondent’s economic evaluation of\n\ntheir personal situation versus the national situation. Question 4 is recoded in the same\n\nmanner as Question 1.\n\nThe second independent variable included in this study is corruption. While the\n\nABS Survey provides several different ways to tap into the issue of corruption, I choose\n\nto follow a number of previous studies in looking at corruption through the lenses of\n\ngovernmental efforts to combat corruption. To capture perceptions of anti-corruption\n\nefforts, I utilize Question 119, which reads, “In your opinion, is the government working\n\nto crack down on corruption and root out bribery?”. This is akin to the operationalization\n\nof the variable as done by studies such as Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013), although it might\n\nalso be reasonable to follow studies such as Park (2017) and Wang (2013), who use a\n\nquestion asking about how widespread corrupt behavior is. Using Question 119,\n\nrespondents are presented with a 4-point Likert scale with response ranging from “It is\n\ndoing its best” (1) to “Doing nothing” (4), but I recode this variable so that “It is doing its\n\nbest” correlates to 4 and “Doing nothing” correlates to 1.\n\n29\n\nThe third and fourth independent variables included in this study relate to social\n\ncapital. As discussed in the literature review, studies looking at social capital have taken a\n\nfew different approaches to this topic. Some restrict their analysis solely to social trust,\n\nwhile others control for both this and membership in a variety of civic organizations. To\n\nbe as comprehensive as possible, I follow with the latter category, and as such I attempt\n\nto capture the impact of social capital with two different variables. The first is\n\nmembership in a variety of civic organizations. Via the ABS Survey, this is captured with\n\nquestions 20-22, asking respondents to name various organizations that they belong to.\n\nWang (2013) uses the absolute number of organizations as a measure of this variable,\n\nhowever, the 4th Wave data set contains a variable “fq” indicating whether the respondent\n\nis a member of any formal organization which I have recoded from “Yes” (1) and “No”\n\n(2) to a dichotomous variable where being a member of formal organization is coded as 1\n\nand not being a member is coded as 0. This is in line with the way that Huang, Lee, and\n\nLin (2013) operationalize the variable. Additionally, I utilize two different methods to\n\ncapture social trust. First, in line with studies such as Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013), Park\n\n(2017), and Wang (2013), I utilize Question 23 of the ABS Survey, “Generally speaking,\n\nwould you say that ‘most people can be trusted’ or ‘that you must be careful in dealing\n\nwith people?” While this variable was initiated coded so that “Most people can be\n\ntrusted,” was a 1 and, “You must be very careful in dealing with people,” was a 2, I\n\nrecode this so that a value of 0 indicates a lack of trust in others and a value of 1 indicates\n\ntrust in other people. But, in order to test whether a different operationalization of social\n\ntrust would alter its relationship with institutional trust, I also follow the general method\n\nput forward by Mujani and Liddle (2013) and construct an indexed measure of social\n\n30\n\ntrust, utilizing questions 23 and 26-28 of the ABS survey6. Questions 26-28 ask\n\nrespondents to what extent they trust a subset of the population: relatives, neighbors, and\n\nothers you interact with, respectively. For each question, the response options consist of a\n\n4-point Likert scale ranging from “A great deal of trust,” (1) to “None at all,” (4)7, with\n\nthese options recoded in reverse order. Once recoded, Questions 26-28 are converted into\n\nvalues of 0 or 1 to indicate non-trusting or trusting and all and four questions are summed\n\nto create an indexed social trust measure.\n\nOf note, even a cursory glance at the distributions of answers to the questions\n\ncomposing these two operationalizations suggests that the choice of method will\n\npotentially affect the relationship between social trust and institutional trust. In Table 1.1\n\nbelow, the responses to questions 26-28 have been recoded so that 0 represents not\n\ntrusting and 1 represents trusting. Missing values are not included in the table. For the\n\ndichotomous measure of social trust commonly utilized in the literature, the vast majority\n\nof the survey sample believes they must be careful in dealing with others. However, in\n\nthe case of trusting relatives and neighbors the lion’s share of the survey sample falls into\n\nthe trusting category. Moreover, while there does appear to be a decrease in trust as the\n\ncircle of people expands, at somewhere between 14-15% per stage, even when this is\n\nextended to include the wider population that respondents interact with, most of the\n\nsurvey believe they can trust others. This stands in direct contrast to the more common,\n\nsingle-question measure of social trust, where only 28.8% of the sample felt that most\n\n6 One of the questions used in the index created by Mujani and Liddle (2013) is not asked in Indonesia as part of the Wave 4 survey. In the interests of including Indonesia in the remainder of the analysis, I choose to use the other four questions to create a four-point scale. 7 The full range of responses is: “A great deal of trust” (1); “Quite a lot of trust” (2); “Not very much trust” (3); “None at all” (4).\n\n31\n\npeople can be trusted. This disparity reinforces the notion that it will be useful to test both\n\nmeasures of social trust in further analysis and compare to what extent the performance\n\nof the two measures vary.\n\nTable 1.1: Responses to Social Trust Questions\n\nSocial Trust Dichotomous\n\nMeasure\n\nTrust in Relatives Trust in Neighbors\n\nTrust in Others you Interact With\n\nFrequency Percent Frequency Percent Frequency Percent Frequency Percent 0 13186 67.7 2410 12.4 5375 27.6 8050 41.4\n\n1 5613 28.8 16787 86.2 13547 69.6 10651 54.7\n\nTotal 18800 96.6 19198 98.6 18922 97.2 18701 96.1\n\nFifth, one of the core independent variables in this project is the measure of the\n\nrespondent’s traditionalism, or traditional social values (TSV). While discussed in more\n\ndepth in the literature review, it is important to reiterate that there are a variety of ways in\n\nwhich to conceivably operationalize this measure of traditionalism or TSV, ranging from\n\nWang, Wan, and Hsiao’s (2011) definition of traditionalism as belief in the supremacy of\n\none’s traditional culture over another society’s, to Wang’s (2013) three-question index, to\n\nthe various models that Ikeda (2013) develops based on prior research and analysis of the\n\nAsian Barometer dataset. In this paper, I utilize a definition that Ikeda (2013) tests,\n\nspecifically the seven-question battery for an overarching traditionalism scale, for a few\n\nkey reasons.\n\nFirst, as it relates to Wang, Wan, and Hsiao (2011), the measure they use to define\n\ntraditionalism is very specific, and rather than tapping into the extent that a respondent\n\nholds onto traditional cultural beliefs, it instead seems likely to measure something akin\n\nto cultural nationalism. By contrast, the models that Wang (2013) and Ikeda (2013)\n\n32\n\nutilize, based on data from prior waves of the Asian Barometer Survey, seem to much\n\nmore directly tap into cultural views. However, Wang (2013) chooses to utilize the 2nd\n\nWave of the Asian Barometer Survey, whereas Ikeda (2013) utilizes the 3rd Wave, and\n\nthis decision has important implications for the replicability of their respective models.\n\nBetween the 2nd and 3rd Waves of the Asian Barometer Survey, the battery of questions\n\nrelated to traditionalism changed significantly, with 11 questions either having altered\n\nwording or being entirely new in the 3rd Wave as compared to the 2nd Wave. By contrast,\n\nthe 3rd and 4th Wave sections on traditionalism are remarkably similar, with only a single\n\nquestion having been removed in the latter survey. Importantly, this means that the\n\noperationalization of traditionalism that Ikeda (2013) utilizes in his study on 3rd Wave\n\ndata can be replicated with the 4th Wave data used in this paper.\n\nEach of the questions present in the 4th Wave survey’s battery on traditionalism are 4 point Likert scales, asking respondents to indicate to what extent they agree with a series\n\nof statements, with responses ranging from “Strongly Agree” (1) to “Strongly Disagree”\n\n(4). I first recode each of these variables so that “Strongly Disagree” corresponds to 1 and\n\n“Strongly Agree” corresponds to 4. Then, I create an index following the method Ikeda\n\n(2013) utilizes, incorporating the recoded variants of questions 55, 57, 60, 62, 63, 64, and\n\n658, wherein the mean of the summed responses to these questions is calculated, forming\n\na new 1-4 scale.\n\n8 Questions composing the scale: Q55 - “For the sake of the family, the individual should put his personal interests second.”; Q57 – “For the sake of national interest, individual interest could be sacrificed.”; Q60 - Even if parents’ demands are unreasonable, children still should do what they ask.”; Q62 – “Being a student, one should not question the authority of their teacher.”; Q63 – “In a group, we should avoid open quarrel to preserve the harmony of the group.”; Q64 – “Even if there is some disagreement with others, one should avoid the conflict.”; Q65 – “A person should not insist on his own opinion if his co-workers disagree with him.”\n\n33\n\nThe prior literature on traditional social values in the region has largely focused\n\nitself on what Tan and Tambyah (2011) term, “Confucian Asia” – China, Japan,\n\nSingapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. Tang (2011), for example,\n\nmakes an explicit connection to Confucianism, arguing that, “… we cannot conduct our\n\nanalysis by relying on perspectives taken from Western culturalism that make no\n\nallowance for the importance of Confucian values in East Asian cultures,” (pg. 12). Wang\n\n(2013) limits his analysis of traditionalism to only Confucian Asia, looking at China,\n\nJapan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Yang and Tang (2010) similarly explicitly link attitudes\n\ntowards hierarchy with the Confucian tradition, and even Zhai (2016), who acknowledges\n\nthe influence of non-Confucian traditions on Chinese thought, limits in-depth analysis to\n\nChina and data-based comparisons of traditional values to Confucian Asia proper. These\n\nstudies showcase at least some consensus on the need to test the role of traditional social\n\nvalues in shaping institutional trust in a subset of the wider region.\n\nWhile there are certainly reasonable arguments to be made for the applicability of\n\nthe traditionalism measures as defined by the 4th Wave Asian Barometer Survey to be\n\napplicable in what Tan and Tambyah (2011) term “Confucian Asia,” it is important to\n\ndiscuss whether such a measure would be appropriate for the rest of the region. A simple\n\ncountry-by-country comparison of the mean scores for the traditional social values\n\nhighlights an interesting trend that supports the assertion that the measure is capturing a\n\nset of ideal and beliefs that are not solely limited to “Confucian Asia,”, but that is also\n\npresent across the wider ABS region and, as Ikeda (2013) notes in his study looking at all\n\n11 East and Southeast Asian countries included in Wave 3 of the Asian Barometer\n\n34\n\nsurvey, potentially in other regions across the globe9. Countries that would seemingly\n\nhave more direct engagement with Confucian thought, for example, China, Taiwan,\n\nJapan, and South Korea, fall on the lower end of the scales for the measure of\n\ntraditionalism, whereas the other countries in the 4th Wave data set actually exhibit higher\n\nlevels.\n\nTable 1.2: Mean TSV Scores by Country\n\nMean TSV Scores by Country Country Mean TSV Value Japan 2.5 Hong Kong 2.52 Korea 2.57 China 2.75 Mongolia 3.01 Philippines 3.07 Taiwan 2.65 Thailand 2.91 Indonesia 3.12 Singapore 2.78 Cambodia 3.06 Malaysia 3.1 Myanmar 3.39\n\nOne potential explanation for this is that solely defining the set of beliefs that the\n\nAsian Barometer traditionalism battery of questions attempts to capture as ‘Confucian’ is\n\nincorrect; as Zhai (2016) notes while using this battery of questions to tap into the impact\n\nof traditionalism on institutional trust in China, at least in the Chinese case Buddhism and\n\n9 Specifically, Ikeda (2013) argues that, “What we mean by “Asian” in this essay is that the traditional social values detailed here are widely supported in the East/Southeast Asian area. It does not deny that the same value configuration has support in other areas of the world,” (pg. 20).\n\n35\n\nTaoism also play important roles in shaping traditional Chinese thought. That\n\ntraditionally “Confucian” Asia actually falls on the lower end of these two measures of\n\ntraditionalism, then, supports the assertion that the ABS measure is in fact picking up a\n\nmore wide-ranging set of beliefs, not solely Confucian beliefs. Understanding the ABS\n\nmeasure of traditional social values in these terms, not as values ascribed to a single\n\ntradition but as values that can be identified in a number of unique cultural backgrounds,\n\nsuggests that it is reasonable to apply such a measure to every country in the data set, not\n\njust a sub-set therein.\n\nFinally, the regression analysis conducted in this paper will include a variety of\n\nadditional control variables. In addition to traditional demographic variables such as age,\n\neducation, gender, and income, I also choose to include a Freedom House score for each\n\ncountry so as to attempt to capture any facets of living in a comparatively more or less\n\nauthoritarian society that are not picked up by other variables used in my analysis. In\n\nother words, this variable attempts to identify to what extent, controlling for other factors,\n\nregime type influences institutional trust. In order to do this, I created a new variable in\n\nthe data set, “FreedomHouse,” setting the value of the variable to the Freedom House\n\nscore of the respondent’s country in the year that the survey was conducted.10\n\nTaking in the full account of relevant variables, in the following section I will\n\nconduct regression analysis on the 4th Wave ABS data set, testing the relationship\n\nbetween traditional social values and institutional trust, controlling for the other\n\n10 For the year that surveys were conducted, Myanmar did not receive a traditional PolityIV score, as the country underwent a transition in 2015. Additionally, Hong Kong as a territory does not receive a PolityIV Score. Because of these issues, and since every country/territory in this data set receives a Freedom House score, I choose to use Freedom House rather than PolityIV as a proxy for living in a more or less authoritarian system.\n\n36\n\nindependent variables discussed above. This analysis will first be conducted on the full\n\n13-country data set, utilizing Trust Index 1, and afterward this analysis will be re-run on\n\nthe nine-country data set, utilizing Trust Index 2. In each case, I will additionally dis aggregate the data set and re-run the analysis on a country by country level to pick up any\n\nvariation in the relative effectiveness of the models.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nBefore diving into detailed regression analysis of the determinants of institutional\n\ntrust, it is helpful to have a general understanding of the levels of institutional trust in the\n\n13 countries under study. Table 1.3 below displays the mean value of Trust Index 1 by\n\ncountry along with the respective countries’ Freedom House scores for the year that\n\nsurveys were conducted in that country. Based on Table 1.3, there is a noticeable level of\n\nvariance within the region. The mean for the entire region is 2.6894, and seven of the\n\nthirteen countries’ average levels of institutional trust fall below this point. These levels\n\nfall as low as 2.25 in South Korea and rise as high as 3.07 in China, .82 points on a scale\n\nranging from 1 to 4. In line with much of the recent discussion on low levels of political\n\ntrust in democratic societies, it is telling that it is the comparatively long-standing\n\ndemocracies of the region, such as Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, in which trust is\n\nlowest. Moreover, of the six countries with a Freedom House score of six or less on the\n\noverall 14-point scale11, five of them (Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, Philippines, and\n\nTaiwan) all fall below the regional mean for political trust. These findings suggest reason\n\n11 When utilizing the Freedom House measure, a lower score indicates that a country is relatively freer than a country with a higher score. As such, the fact that lower Freedom House scores seem to be associated with lower levels of institutional trust means that freer countries appear to have lower levels of institutional trust.\n\n37\n\nfor concern among scholars tracking the decline in institutional trust in democracies\n\nacross the globe.\n\nTable 1.3: Mean Trust Levels by Country (Trust Index 1)\n\nMean Trust Levels by Country for Trust Index 1 Country Mean Standard Error of Mean Freedom House Score Japan 2.48 0.02 2 Hong Kong 2.55 0.02 7 Korea 2.25 0.01 5 China 3.07 0.01 13 Mongolia 2.46 0.01 4 Philippines 2.51 0.02 6 Taiwan 2.28 0.01 3 Thailand 2.78 0.02 11 Indonesia 2.77 0.01 6 Singapore 3.05 0.02 8 Cambodia 2.73 0.02 11 Malaysia 2.98 0.02 8 Myanmar 2.41 0.02 11\n\nKeeping this regional variation in mind, I first run OLS regression analysis on the\n\nfull thirteen-country data set with Trust Index 112 as the dependent variable, creating\n\nthree models. I test these models first for the regional data sample with all countries\n\nincluded, and then I additionally test the models for each country. The first model\n\ncontains only factors that have regularly been investigated in the wider literature on\n\ninstitutional trust in the region: Evaluations of the national and local economic situation,\n\nperceptions of anti-corruption efforts, as well as social trust and social capital. In these\n\nmodels, social trust is defined using a dichotomous variable derived from the response to\n\nQuestion 23 from the ABS Survey. In Model 2, I introduce the measure of traditional\n\n12 Trust Index 1 is composed of only trust in the courts, the national government, parliament, the civil service, the military, and the police.\n\n38\n\nsocial values (TSV) as operationalized by Ikeda (2013), Finally, Model 3 introduces\n\nvarious other control variables, namely gender, education, income, and a Freedom House\n\nscore assigned by the related score of the respondent’s country.\n\nTable 1.4 Trust Index 1 Regional-Level OLS Regression\n\nModel Unstandardized Coefficients\n\nStandardized Coefficients\n\nt Sig.\n\nB Std.

First, in every model, respondents’ evaluations of the national\n\neconomic situation (Q1) and evaluations of governmental anti-corruption efforts (Q119)\n\nhave a positive, significant impact on institutional trust. That these are consistent across\n\nall three models and the magnitude of the associated coefficients are the largest in each\n\n39\n\nmodel reinforces the broader conclusion that can be drawn from the literature:\n\nevaluations of governmental performance, utilizing the national economic situation as a\n\nproxy, and evaluations of government anti-corruption efforts are reliable determinants of\n\ninstitutional trust in the region. Interestingly, while respondents’ evaluations of their\n\nfamily economic situation (Q4) do not reach significance in Model 1 or Model 2, it does\n\nso in Model 3; however, even in Model 3 the coefficient is much smaller than the\n\ncoefficient associated with Q1.\n\nMoreover, this trend continues when Trust Index 1 is tested on the country level13,\n\nrather than considering the entire sample on aggregate. In each model where Q4 is\n\nsignificant at p <= .05, it exerts a notably smaller, but still positive effect on institutional\n\ntrust than the evaluation of the national economic situation. Compounding this issue, at\n\nthe country level Q4 repeatedly fails to reach the level of significance. For Hong Kong,\n\nSouth Korea, China, Thailand, Indonesia (p-value of .055 in Model 3) and Myanmar, Q4\n\nis not significant in all three models. For Cambodia, and the Philippines, Q4 is only\n\nsignificant in Model 3, in Taiwan it is significant in Model 2 and Model 3, although the\n\np-value in Model 1 is .053, and in Singapore Q4 is only significant in models 1 and 2,\n\nfailing to reach significance in Model 3.\n\nWhat to make of these trends? At a minimum, while evaluations of familial\n\neconomic situation do seem to have some impact on levels of institutional trust at the\n\nregional level, and in a small subset of the data at the country level, this impact is much\n\nsmaller as compared to evaluations of the national economic situation. Combine this with\n\n13 See Appendix 1.1 for the country-level regression models; only model three is included for brevity.\n\n40\n\nthe fact that Q4 so often fails to reach significance at the country level, and this suggests\n\nthat evaluations of the national economic situation are a more consistent determinant of\n\ninstitutional trust than family economic evaluations. One potential explanation as to why\n\nevaluations of family economic situation fail to significantly influence institutional trust\n\nis that respondents might fail to link the particulars of their own economic situation to\n\ngovernment actions, reducing the role that this evaluation plays in shaping institutional\n\ntrust, whereas they more explicitly link the national economic situation to governmental\n\nperformance, more drastically influencing institutional trust.\n\nSecond, the various demographic and other control variables present something of\n\na mixed message. As it relates to the demographic controls, there does not appear to be\n\nany particular pattern to be observed. The significance of gender, income, and education\n\nvaries greatly from country to country. Moreover, the direction of these relationships is\n\nnot consistent between the regional model and the country models, or even between\n\ncountries. By contrast, at the regional level the Freedom House score is significantly and\n\npositively correlated with institutional trust; higher Freedom House scores, and therefore\n\n‘less free’ countries, tend to have higher levels of institutional trust.\n\nThird, this analysis offers some insight into the accuracy of Hypothesis 1. While\n\nthis model does not control for partisanship, at the regional level the seven-question\n\noperationalization of traditional social values has a significant, positive impact on\n\ninstitutional trust for both Model 2 and Model 3 (the two models which include TSV as a\n\nvariable). Admittedly, the magnitude of the coefficient in each model is somewhat lower\n\nthan the coefficients attached to questions about the national economic situation and anti corruption efforts. At the same time, the fact that it reaches significance at a p-value of 0\n\n41\n\nseems to suggest that, contrary to the findings of studies such as Wang (2013), traditional\n\nsocial values do have a significant impact on shaping institutional trust in the region.\n\nMoreover, these results are largely in line with the findings of Ikeda (2013), utilizing the\n\nsame operationalization of TSV on a new set of data, and this displays that there is at\n\nleast some degree of replicability over time in the impact of TSV on institutional trust.\n\nIn addition, whereas a country-level analysis casts doubt on the consistency of\n\nevaluations of familial economic situations as a determinant of institutional trust, this\n\ntype of analysis instead further supports Hypothesis 1. There is some variance between\n\nthe magnitude of the associated coefficient for each country, but for all the countries in\n\nthe data set, the seven-question measure of traditional social values is statistically\n\nsignificant to at least the .05 level. In terms of consistency, then, this places traditional\n\nsocial values in the same category as the national economic situation and anti-corruption\n\nefforts, by far the two most consistently significant determinants of institutional trust\n\ntested in the broader literature. Altogether, then, I find initial evidence in support of\n\nHypothesis 1 based on an analysis of Trust Index 1, regardless of whether this analysis is\n\nconducted on the regional sample or country-specific samples, although it is still\n\nnecessary to test this relationship when partisanship is factored into the model.\n\nMoreover, this regression analysis offers some insights into the relationship\n\nbetween social capital, both in terms of participation in organizations as well as social\n\ntrust, and institutional trust. At the regional level, membership in an organization displays\n\na significant relationship with institutional trust in Model 1 and Model 2. Surprisingly,\n\nconsidering the wider literature’s predictions related to social capital, the direction of this\n\nrelationship is negative. However, there are two caveats to these results that call into\n\n42\n\ndoubt the veracity of this relationship. For one, when controlling for gender, education,\n\nincome, and the Freedom House score of respondents in Model 3, membership in an\n\norganization fails to reach significance with a p-value of .387. For another, the\n\nrelationship between institutional trust and organizational membership at the country level varies greatly from country to country. Of the 13 countries in the data set,\n\norganizational membership reaches significance in at least one model in seven countries.\n\nIn Hong Kong, South Korea, Mongolia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Myanmar, organizational\n\nmembership has a significant and positive impact on institutional trust in all three models.\n\nIn Singapore, this relationship is negative but significant only for Model 1. In the other\n\nsix countries, the variable fails to reach significance with 95% certainty in any model. In\n\nother words, the impact of organizational membership on political trust varies based on\n\nlocation, and this level of variance at the country level potentially explains the\n\nunexpected results at the regional level.\n\nFinally, this analysis offers insight into the role that social trust plays in shaping\n\ninstitutional trust. At the regional level, social trust as measured by a dichotomous\n\nvariable is significant in each of the three models tested, and this relationship between\n\nsocial trust and institutional trust is positive. Relative to the magnitude of the coefficients\n\nassociated with anti-corruption efforts or evaluations of the national economy, the impact\n\nof social trust is somewhat smaller. Again, however, the regional level analysis does not\n\ntell the entire story. As compared to organizational membership, social trust performs\n\nmuch better at the country level of analysis, having a significant, positive relationship\n\nwith institutional trust for all models in each country except Mongolia, Cambodia, and\n\n43\n\nTaiwan. For the former two countries, social trust is not significant in any model, and in\n\nTaiwan it is only significant for Model 3.\n\nTable 1.5: Trust Index One OLS Regression with Social Trust Index\n\nModel\n\nUnstandardized Coefficients\n\nStandardized Coefficients\n\nSig.\n\nB Std.

As part of this process, the models are identical\n\nexcept for the fact that, rather than operationalizing social trust as a dichotomous\n\n44\n\nvariable, I instead use the general method utilized by Mujani and Liddle (2013), creating\n\nan index of responses to four separate questions14 to measure social trust. I test these new\n\nmodels at both the regional and country level.15 Looking only at social trust, at the\n\nregional level, while the size of the standardized coefficient associated with social trust is\n\nnotably larger than when a dichotomous measure is used, there is no difference in terms\n\nof the direction of the relationship or the significance between social trust and\n\ninstitutional trust dependent on the operationalization of social trust. Both\n\noperationalizations have a significant, positive impact in all three models. At the country\n\nlevel of analysis, however, there are some immediate differences. Whereas the\n\ndichotomous measure of social trust fails to reach significance in Cambodia, Mongolia,\n\nand in two models in Taiwan, the index operationalization achieves significance in every\n\nmodel in each country. This result in some way supports the idea that divergent\n\noperationalizations of social trust can result in different outcomes; there are differences in\n\nthe statistical significance of social trust dependent on the operationalization16. But these\n\ndifferences are limited to only three of the thirteen countries analyzed, so differences in\n\noperationalization cannot adequately explain the extent of the variation in results that\n\nprior studies testing the relationship between social trust and institutional trust have\n\nfound.\n\n15 See Appendix 1.2 for the country-level regression models; only model three is included for brevity. 16This study focuses on the quantitative impact of different operationalizations of social trust, but Ikeda (2013) provides a brief discussion of the difference between,” … trust in others one already knows…”, “… trust in a category that one knows is trustful, in general, such as medical doctors…,” and, “… when one judges an unknown other (upon first contact) as trustable…” (pg. 18). While it is largely outside of the scope of this study, these two different operationalizations might tap into these different types of trust, leading to the different outcomes observed.\n\n45\n\nTable 1.6: Trust Index Two Regional-Level OLS Regression\n\nModel\n\nUnstandardized Coefficients\n\nStandardized Coefficients\n\nt Sig.\n\nB Std.

As such, Trust\n\nIndex 2 allows for the analysis to tap into responses to a battery of ten institutions (The\n\n46\n\nexecutive office, courts, national government, political parties, parliament, the civil\n\nservice, the military, the police, the local government, and the election commission).\n\nWhen compared to the 13-country model, at the regional level there are slight but\n\nimportant differences in results. Whereas social trust is significant at the .05 level in all\n\nthree models at the regional level and organizational membership is significant at this\n\nlevel in models 1 and 2, utilizing Trust Index 2 these two variables fail to attain\n\nsignificance at the .05 level in Model 1 (with p-values of .094 and .252, respectively), and\n\norganizational membership again fails to reach significance in Model 2. Interestingly,\n\nboth variables are significant in Model 3, whereas organizational membership failed to\n\nreach significance in the 13-country subset. Additionally, Q4 is significant in all three\n\nmodels, whereas it is only significant in Model Three for the 13-country subset. Because\n\nseveral countries have been removed from the sample, though, it is difficult to isolate\n\nwhether these differences are due to the additional institutions added to the institutional\n\ntrust index or the removed cases from the four countries that were dropped. To further\n\ndive into these differences, it is more beneficial to directly compare the country-level\n\nresults17.\n\nUnfortunately, when comparing the country-level models for the nine countries\n\nincluded in both analyses, few clear patterns emerge. Certainly, there are some\n\ndifferences. Relative to the Trust Index 1 measure, in South Korea familial economic\n\nevaluations are significant in all three models, in Taiwan Q4 is significant in Model 1,\n\nand in Cambodia social trust barely fails to meet the 95% confidence level for\n\nsignificance, with a p-value of .051. However, these changes are often isolated to singular\n\n17 See Appendix 1.3 for the country-level models.\n\n47\n\nmodels, and are minimal at best. As such, these results seem to suggest that, on the\n\nmargins, the decision of which institutions to include in a measure of institutional trust\n\ndoes have some ability to impact the interpretation of some of the determinants of\n\ninstitutional trust, but this decision does not impact each variable equally. The one clear\n\ntrend of note is that, for every country in both sets, the R-squared value of the model\n\nutilizing Trust Index 2 as its dependent variable is higher than that of Trust Index 1.\n\nWhile this does not directly reflect on which operationalization of institutional trust most\n\naccurately captures trust in government, it does at least support the assertion that the\n\nindependent variables used in both models more fully predict Trust Index 2’s broader\n\ndefinition of institutional trust.\n\nAt the same time, the results of the analysis of Trust Index 2 do offer further\n\ninsight into Hypothesis 1. Namely, the seven-question index for traditional social values\n\nonce again remains a consistent determinant of institutional trust, showing a significant\n\nand positive relationship with institutional trust in all three models at the regional level as\n\nwell as in each country. Much like in the thirteen-country analysis, this consistency is\n\nakin to that of evaluations of the national economic situation and governmental anti corruption efforts. All together then, these findings provide further support for\n\nHypothesis 1.\n\n48\n\nINSTITUTIONAL TRUST AND PARTISANSHIP\n\nData and Methods\n\nHaving concluded the above discussion investigating Hypothesis 1 and the impact\n\nof varying operationalizations of social trust, this section of the paper centers around an\n\ninvestigation into Hypothesis 2, largely inspired by the work of Huang, Lee, and Lin\n\n(2013). As discussed in the literature review, in their paper, Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013)\n\nfind that broadly speaking, partisanship, defined as self-identified association with a\n\npolitical party, exerts a significant influence on institutional trust; those that identify with\n\nan opposition party have a significantly lower level of institutional trust. Moreover,\n\nborrowing a framework from the work of Rothstein and Stolle (2008), Huang, Lee, and\n\nLin (2013) divide the institutions they investigate into “partisan” and “neutral”\n\ninstitutions; while there is variance from country to country, the study generally finds that\n\nthe impact of partisanship is larger for partisan institutions than neutral institutions.\n\nIn this section of the paper, I draw heavily on this approach, with a few key\n\ndifferences. First, and perhaps most important, I choose to define partisanship in a\n\nslightly different manner. Within the context of this study, I choose to define partisanship\n\nnot as self-identified affiliation with a party but instead as whether respondents voted for\n\nthe winner or loser of the last major election, as identified by the Asian Barometer\n\nSurvey. This operationalization is functionally akin to the measure that taps into what\n\nPark (2017), citing the work of Anderson et. al (2005), terms the “winner-loser thesis,”\n\npredicting that, “… political [institutional] trust should be higher among those who voted\n\n49\n\nfor the party in power while lower among those who voted for the opposition,” (pg. 501).\n\nI choose this operationalization method for two major reasons. One, as discussed in the\n\nliterature review, there are some notable differences between the findings of Park and\n\nHuang, Lee, and Lin, but due to Park’s limited definition of which institutions matter\n\nwhen considering institutional trust, it is impossible to isolate whether said differences\n\nare due to different operationalizations of ‘partisanship’ or differences in the battery of\n\ninstitutions considered. Measuring partisanship in a manner like Park with an expanded\n\nbattery of institutions may help clarify this issue. Two, Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) rely\n\non detailed knowledge of the political situation in the countries they investigate in order\n\nto properly identify and define what, if any, coalitions represent those in power and the\n\nopposition. By contrast, the variable used to identify winners and losers in the Wave 4\n\nABS data set, Q34a, was created by the in-country survey teams. By utilizing their\n\ndefinitions of winners and losers, I can rely on their knowledge of the local political\n\nscene.\n\nThere are some potential ramifications of this choice to consider. All things\n\nconsidered, it seems reasonable to expect relatively high levels of consistency between\n\nthe two measures – we would expect supporters of a given party to vote for said party,\n\nand opponents to vote against said party. One potential point of concern, however, is\n\nwhether or not voters report their voting behavior accurately. For example, several\n\nstudies focusing on the United States (e.g. Wright 1990; Wright 1992; Carsey and\n\nJackson 2001) have found long-running issues with excessively high numbers of voters\n\nreporting that they had voted for the winner in elections. It may be a concern, then, that\n\nthe number of winners is overstated and some people who voted for a loser or did not\n\n50\n\nvote may be classified as winners. Based on the predictions of Hypothesis 2 and the party\n\naffiliation partisanship-related findings of Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013), this could\n\nartificially deflate trust levels among winners.\n\nI would, however, push back on this concern to some extent. When analyzing the\n\nmean levels of institutional trust for winners, losers, and non-voters in the eight countries\n\nI include in the regression analysis below, the expected distribution of trust levels is still\n\nevident.\n\nFigure 2.1: Mean Trust Levels by Voter Category\n\nFigure 2.1 displays this point. For all three institution classifications utilized in\n\nthis chapter, winners display the highest mean levels of trust, followed by non-voters,\n\nfollowed by losers. Even if some members of the latter category have misreported their\n\nvoting behavior and therefore have been miscategorized, it does not appear to alter the\n\nfundamental relationship that would be expected.\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nGeneral Trust Index Partisan Trust Index Neutral Trust Index\n\nMean Trust Level\n\nTrust Index\n\nMean Trust Levels by Voter Category\n\nNon-Voters Winners Losers\n\n51\n\nIn addition to this difference, as implied using eight countries from the sample, I\n\nchoose to slightly vary the countries included in this analysis. Huang, Lee, and Lin\n\n(2013) choose to investigate six countries included in Wave 3 of the Asian Barometer\n\nSurvey: South Korea, Taiwan, Mongolia, The Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia. By\n\ncontrast, I choose to include eight of the countries from Wave 4 of the Asian Barometer\n\nSurvey that I used when analyzing Trust Index 2 above: Japan, South Korea, Mongolia,\n\nThe Philippines, Taiwan, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar.\n\nThis difference exists for a few reasons. First, Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) choose\n\nto utilize a single definition of partisan and neutral institutions across all the countries\n\nthey study, predicated on the assumption that, “… the involvement of national elections,\n\nin which all major parties compete, is the principal criterion for partisan politics,” (pg.\n\n10) Based on this assumption, the authors, “… classify the president/prime minister, the\n\nnational government, and parliament as partisan institutions and the courts, civil service,\n\nthe military, the police, and the election commission as neutral institutions,” (Huang, Lee,\n\nand Lin 2013, pg. 10). Moreover, they exclude newspapers, television, and NGOs as\n\nneither partisan nor neutral institutions, and political parties and local government\n\nbecause they are, “… not unique nationally, and respondents of the ABS may have been\n\nreferring to different entities,” (Huang, Lee, and Lin 2013, pg. 10). Broadly speaking, I\n\nbelieve these classifications to be reasonable, and I mirror them in my analysis in this\n\nchapter. Unfortunately, questions about the election commission were not asked in\n\nIndonesia in Wave 4 of the ABS, precluding its inclusion, and a similar lack prevents the\n\ninclusion of China or Singapore.\n\n52\n\nExcluding Indonesia, China, and Singapore, the remaining sample consists of ten\n\ncountries. However, there are some peculiarities with the winner and loser data at the\n\ncountry level that are a potential cause for concern.\n\nTable 2.1: Distribution of Winners, Losers, and Non-Voters\n\nWinnerLoserAggregate Total Total N Valid %\n\nNon-Voter Winner Loser\n\nJapan 199 396 325 920 1081 85.11 Hong Kong 128 85 114 327 1217 26.87 Korea 171 491 295 957 1200 79.75 Mongolia 133 702 338 1173 1228 95.52 Philippines 182 694 184 1060 1200 88.33 Taiwan 260 623 518 1401 1657 84.55 Thailand 88 186 228 502 1200 41.83 Cambodia 257 576 283 1116 1200 93.00 Malaysia 165 506 146 817 1207 67.69 Myanmar 447 392 403 1242 1620 76.67 Total 2030 4651 2834 9515 12810 74.28\n\nDue to the way in which Q34a is coded, only three categories of responses are\n\nprovided: voting for the winner, voting for the loser, or a non-applicable category. This\n\nmeans that it is impossible to establish a baseline of non-voters from Q34a alone; it is\n\nimpossible to know whether the non-applicable category refers to a respondent not\n\nvoting, voting but refusing to disclose who they voted for, whether the data for the said\n\nvoter is missing, and so on. Instead, it is necessary to pull data from both Q34a and Q33.\n\nSo, from Q33 I retrieve whether a respondent did not vote in the last election, providing\n\nthe non-voter baseline, and then from Q34a I pull information about whether voters voted\n\nfor the winning or losing party or candidate in the last election. I use this information to\n\ncreate the variable WinnerLoserAggregate, responses to which are detailed in Table 2.1,\n\n53\n\na variable that contains information on respondents who either confirmed they did not\n\nvote or voters who did vote and provided information on who they voted for. From this\n\nvariable, I create dummy variables for winners and for losers that will be used in the\n\nregression analysis.\n\nThe issue, and what necessitates the inclusion of only eight countries out of the\n\nremaining ten, is that for Hong Kong and Thailand there are notable issues with this data.\n\nAs seen in Table 2.1, in Hong Kong only 26.9% of all respondents from the territory can\n\nbe classified as a winner, a loser, or a non-voter. In Thailand18, only 41.8% of\n\nrespondents can be classified in this way. Comparatively, in every other country, at least\n\ntwo-thirds of respondents can be classified. For this reason, I choose to exclude both\n\nHong Kong and Thailand from the analysis, leaving only eight countries.\n\nMoving forward, I conduct the analysis in three parts, following the process\n\nutilized by Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013). In addition to a measure of generalized\n\ninstitutional trust, TrustIndexGeneral19, an indexed measure of questions 7, 8, 9, 11, 12,\n\n13, 14, and 18 constructed in the same manner as Trust Index 1 and Trust Index 2 above,\n\nI also create a measure of institutional trust in partisan institutions, TrustIndexPartisan,\n\nconsisting of only questions 7, 9, and 11, and a measure of institutional trust in neutral\n\ninstitutions, TrustIndexNeutral, consisting of questions 8, 12, 13, 14, and 18. In each\n\n18 As an additional note, for respondents from Thailand, 1064 respondents stated that they voted in Q33, with 88 saying they did not and 48 either refusing to answer or otherwise not having a coded yes/no answer to the question. But, in Q34 and Q34a, 612 respondents are missing, rather than declining to answer or falling into some similar category. I cannot account for such a massive discrepancy, one that is not present for many other questions in the survey, and this provides further reason to exclude Thailand from the analysis in this section. 19 The institutions included in this measure are: The Executive Office, the National Government, Parliament, the Courts, the Civil Service, the Military, the Police, and the Election Commission. The former three constitute the partisan trust index measure, and the latter five constitute the neutral trust index measure.\n\n54\n\ncase, the minimum response is a 1 and the maximum a 4, ranging from the least amount\n\nof institutional trust to the maximum. I treat each of these indexes as their own dependent\n\nvariable, and I conduct regression analysis at both the regional level and at the country\n\nlevel for each one. The independent variables, outside of the addition of the winner and\n\nloser dummy variables, remain the same as in Chapter 1.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nBefore diving into the regression analysis, it is beneficial to have a general grasp\n\nof the relationship between these three measures of institutional trust. Table 2.2 displays\n\nthe mean values for each of the three measures along with the standard error of the mean.\n\nFrom this distribution, it is possible to identify some general trends. First, following the\n\ntrends associated with the institutional trust measures in Chapter 1, countries with lower\n\nFreedom House scores, therefore being considered freer, tend to have lower levels of\n\ninstitutional trust across the board. Second, largely consistent with the findings of Huang,\n\nLee, and Lin (2013), the mean partisan institutional trust measure is lower than both the\n\nneutral and general measures of institutional trust in every country except Myanmar.\n\nIn the case of Myanmar, this unique distribution can be better highlighted by\n\ntaking an in-depth look at trust levels in these eight countries for all institutions included\n\nin the general trust index. For the three partisan institutions (the executive office, the\n\nnational government, and parliament) the mean scores in Myanmar are approximately .2\n\nto .25 points higher than the regional average. For the five neutral institutions, mean trust\n\nin the courts and the civil service are .1 to .15 points lower, but the major differences lie\n\nwith trust in the military, approximately .25 points lower, and the police, more than .5\n\npoints on a four-point scale. It is possible these drastically lower levels of trust in two of\n\n55\n\nthe five neutral institutions, in combination with above-average trust in partisan\n\ninstitutions, create this statistical oddity.\n\nTable 2.2: Mean Trust Levels by Institution Type\n\nMoving into the OLS regression analysis, the findings are in many ways\n\nconsistent with the findings and predictions of Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) and support\n\nHypothesis 2. Of note, in the previous chapter, I ran the regression analysis with three\n\nmodels. But, because this chapter concerns both regional and country-level analysis for\n\nthree different dependent variables, I choose to simply run one model for each case. This\n\nmodel includes all the independent variables including demographic controls, making the\n\nmodels functionally like Model 3 in the previous chapter outside of the addition of the\n\nwinner and loser dummy variables.\n\nBeginning with the general institutional trust model, at the regional level all\n\nvariables except for the female dummy variable, income quintiles, and organizational\n\nmembership reach significance at the 95% confidence level. It should be noted, however,\n\nthat while organizational membership does not strictly meet this definition of\n\nsignificance, its associated p-value is .059. Much like in Chapter 1, evaluations of the\n\nnational economic situation and anti-corruption efforts exert significant, positive\n\nTrustIndexPartisan TrustIndexNeutral TrustIndexGeneral Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE Freedom House Japan 2.17 0.02 2.66 0.02 2.48 0.02 2 Korea 2.1 0.02 2.41 0.02 2.29 0.01 5 Mongolia 2.3 0.02 2.53 0.01 2.44 0.01 4 Philippines 2.46 0.02 2.6 0.02 2.54 0.02 6 Taiwan 2.07 0.01 2.39 0.01 2.27 0.01 3 Cambodia 2.71 0.02 2.77 0.02 2.74 0.02 11 Malaysia 2.93 0.02 2.99 0.02 2.97 0.02 8 Myanmar 2.65 0.02 2.37 0.02 2.47 0.02 11\n\n56\n\ninfluences in institutional trust, and the standardized coefficients for these two variables\n\nare by far the largest in the model. Social trust, traditional social values, the Freedom\n\nHouse score, and evaluations of family economic situation all have a significant and\n\npositive relationship with institutional trust, but the standardized coefficients are\n\ncomparatively low. Interestingly, these initial results do seem to further support the\n\npredictions of Hypothesis 1; even when controlling for partisanship, higher levels of\n\ntraditional social values are correlated with higher levels of institutional trust. Higher\n\nlevels of education do result in a significantly lower level of institutional trust, but the\n\nmagnitude of this relationship is relatively small. Finally, moving on to the winner and\n\nloser dummy variables, these initial findings provide support for Hypothesis 2. Compared\n\nto non-voters, voting for the winning party in the last election results in a significant and\n\npositive change in general institutional trust at the regional level, and voting for the\n\nlosing party results in a significant decrease in institutional trust.\n\nTable 2.3: General Institutional Trust Regional-Level OLS Regression\n\nModel Unstandardized Coefficients\n\nStandardized Coefficients\n\nt Sig.\n\nB Std.

Much of this\n\nvariance can be attributed to the various demographic controls, but more pertinent to this\n\ndiscussion is the variance in the significance of the winner and loser dummy variables,\n\nsocial trust, organizational membership, and traditional social values. Compared to the\n\nregional model, organizational membership is significant and positively associated with\n\ninstitutional trust in South Korea, Mongolia, and Myanmar. Social trust fails to reach\n\nsignificance in Mongolia and Cambodia. Considering that these two variables displayed\n\nsimilar levels of variance in significance in the previous chapter, such trends are not\n\ninherently surprising. However, for the first time, traditional social values fail to reach\n\nsignificance in a model – in Myanmar, the associated p-value is only .082. Finally, the\n\nwinner and loser dummy variables are somewhat erratic. In the case of the former, the\n\nwinner dummy variable is not significant in Mongolia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and\n\nMyanmar. In the case of the latter, the loser dummy variable fails to reach significance in\n\nJapan, Mongolia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Myanmar. These findings do not entirely\n\ndiscredit Hypothesis 2 as one might expect the influence of voting for the winning or\n\nlosing party to be diluted in a trust measure that includes both partisan and non-partisan\n\ninstitutions, but it does at least begin to suggest the impact of such effects is not even\n\nacross all countries, much as Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) find in their study, and it raises\n\nthe possibility that the loss in trust from voting for a loser is less noticeable than the\n\nincrease in trust from voting for the winner.\n\n20 See Appendix 2.1 for the country level regression models.\n\n58\n\nKeeping these findings in mind, I then move onto the analysis of the partisan trust\n\nindex. At the regional level, only the female and income quintile variables fail to reach\n\nsignificance, and there is no variation in the direction of the significant relationships\n\nbetween the general and partisan models. The magnitude of the impact of the winner and\n\nloser variables is also higher for the partisan trust index than the general trust index,\n\nwhich suggests that the scale of the impact for voting for the winner or loser may be\n\nlarger for partisan institutions. Like the general trust index, there is still noticeable\n\nvariation in terms of the significance of determinants between countries21. Organizational\n\nmembership fails to reach significance in Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Cambodia, and\n\nMalaysia. Social trust fails to reach significance at the 95% confidence level in Mongolia,\n\nthe Philippines (with a p-value of .061), Taiwan, and Cambodia. Again, traditional social\n\nvalues fail to reach significance in one country, but in this case, it is Mongolia, not\n\nMyanmar. While this does not discredit the notion that, in many cases, traditional social\n\nvalues are an important determinant of institutional trust, the fact that evaluations of\n\nnational economic performance and anti-corruption continue to remain significant in\n\nevery model highlights their relative consistency compared to other determinants.\n\n21 See Appendix 2.2 for the country level regression models.\n\n59\n\nTable 2.4: Partisan Institutional Trust Regional-Level OLS Regression\n\nModel\n\nUnstandardized Coefficients\n\nStandardized Coefficients\n\nt Sig.\n\nB Std.

Again, the inconsistency of the winner and loser\n\nvariables in certain countries further supports the assertion that the impact of partisanship\n\non institutional trust is, while a factor, one that cannot be generalized to every country.\n\nBut both the winner and loser variables reach significance in a larger number of countries\n\nfor the partisan institutions, and the direction of the relationship for the countries where\n\nthese measures reach significance is in line with expectations, so in many ways, these\n\nfindings still provide support for Hypothesis 2.\n\nFinally, I repeat the above process for the neutral trust index. At the regional\n\nlevel, the results are quite like those of the general trust index, with organizational\n\n60\n\nmembership, the female dummy variable, and income quintiles not reaching significance\n\nat the 95% confidence level. While these results are quite similar, an important difference\n\nis that the R Square value for the neutral trust index is notably smaller at .199 than the\n\ngeneral trust index, .292, or the partisan trust index, .355. Similarly, for each country the\n\nR Square value of the neutral trust index is lower than that of the partisan trust index.\n\nThis, in combination with the fact that the magnitude of the coefficients for the winner\n\nand loser variables in the neutral trust index are the smallest out of all three regional\n\nmodels, suggests that the winner and loser variables in particular, and the entirety of the\n\nindependent variables tested in general, are less able to explain variance in institutional\n\ntrust for these neutral institutions.\n\nTable 2.5: Neutral Institutional Trust Regional-Level OLS Regression\n\nModel\n\nUnstandardized Coefficients\n\nStandardized Coefficients\n\nt Sig.\n\nB Std.

Interestingly,\n\norganizational membership fairs better for these institutions, failing to reach significance\n\nonly in the Philippines, Cambodia, and Malaysia. Social trust fails to reach significance\n\nin Mongolia, Cambodia (p-value .078), and Myanmar (p-value .078), and once more,\n\ntraditional social values fail to reach significance in Myanmar. The variables whose\n\nperformance most suffer in this model, however, are the winner and loser variables. The\n\nwinner variable fails to reach significance in South Korea, Mongolia, the Philippines,\n\nTaiwan, Cambodia, and Myanmar, and the loser variable fails to reach significance in\n\nJapan, Mongolia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Myanmar23. Evaluations of national\n\neconomic performance and governmental anti-corruption efforts are still consistently\n\nsignificant, positive determinants of institutional trust in every country, and evaluations\n\nof family economic situation pass the 95% confidence interval in all but South Korea and\n\nMyanmar.\n\nWhat to make of these findings? Before diving into how these findings shape the\n\nunderstanding of Hypothesis 2, it is necessary to revisit a point made in the literature\n\nreview, the way in which the impact of partisanship in Mongolia serves as an example of\n\npotential issues with a limited definition of which institutions matter when creating a\n\n22 See Appendix 2.3 for the country level regression models. 23 Myanmar is very much an oddity in terms of this analysis, with the winner and loser variables failing to reach significance in every single model. While this may, in fact, be accurate, it is important to note that, as detailed by sources like The Economist (2015) that at the time the Wave 4 ABS was being conducted in Myanmar, the country was in a run-up to its first comparatively free and fair general election in decades, coming on the tail-end of five years of military-approved reforms. Further analysis, perhaps when a fifth wave of the ABS survey is released, will likely be necessary to determine whether these findings are a fluke or a pattern.\n\n62\n\nmeasure of institutional trust. Unfortunately, these results do not provide a\n\ncomprehensive conclusion on whether it was Park’s (2017) choice of a limited definition\n\nof institutional trust, only considering parliament and national government, that led to the\n\ndivergence in findings between his work and the work of Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013). As\n\nI found, only in the case of partisan institutions does voting for the winner have a\n\nsignificant, positive impact on institutional trust in Mongolia. But, trust in parliament and\n\nnational government makes up two-thirds of this measure, so it is difficult to say with\n\ncertainty that it was the institutions chosen rather than changes in the political situation in\n\nMongolia that explain such variance. What the expanded battery of institutions in\n\ncombination with dividing the analysis into partisan and neutral institutions does offer,\n\nhowever, is the ability to concretely state that, at any given period, partisanship does or\n\ndoes not significantly impact trust in a wider set of institutions.\n\nMore broadly, the collective impression is at least somewhat supportive of\n\nHypothesis 2. At the regional level, for each model the winner and loser dummy variables\n\nhave significant impacts on institutional trust, positive for the case of the winner variable\n\nand negative for the loser variable. This supports the assertion that, as compared to non voters, those who vote for the winner of the most recent election display higher levels of\n\ninstitutional trust, not only in partisan institutions but also in institutions more broadly,\n\nand losers display lower levels. It is the country-level results that require conditioning the\n\nacceptance of Hypothesis 2 to some extent.\n\nCertainly, the winner and loser dummy variables perform at different levels\n\ndepending on whether the model uses a more holistic index of institutional trust or a\n\npartisan/non-partisan measure. That the best performance is found in the partisan model,\n\n63\n\nand the worst the neutral model, suggests that on aggregate the impact of partisanship on\n\ntrust in neutral institutions is less than on trust in partisan institutions and is in line with\n\nHypothesis 2 and the findings of Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013). That these broad\n\nrelationships hold when controlling for a wider range of factors than those tested by\n\nHuang, Lee, and Lin (2013) provides further support to their argument that partisanship is\n\nan important determinant to test, one that as of yet is underrepresented in the wider\n\nliterature on institutional trust. At the same time, the wide variance in country-level\n\nresults should serve as something of a cautionary note. It does not seem reasonable to\n\nsuggest that partisanship is a sweeping force that influences institutional trust equally in\n\nevery location as the regional-level results might initially indicate. Instead, it is likely that\n\nthe causal link between partisanship and institutional trust is case-specific, and attempts\n\nto explain such a link will likely necessitate in-depth analysis of time-sensitive situations\n\nin any given location, much as Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) do when attempting to\n\nexplain the variance in results they find in their study.\n\nFinally, with the emphasis that this study places on the roles of traditional social\n\nvalues and partisanship, I re-run the above analysis with a two-level OLS regression\n\nmodel, the first level including all variables except for traditional social values and the\n\nsecond model also including traditional social values. If, for example, there were a\n\nnumber of cases in which the inclusion of traditional social values altered the significance\n\nof the winner or loser variables, it may suggest some form of interaction between these\n\nvariables24. However, this does not appear to be the case. For both the partisan and\n\ngeneral trust indexes, the inclusion of traditional social values in no way influences the\n\n24 Because there is no meaningful difference in results, the models are not included in this paper.\n\n64\n\nsignificance of the winner or loser variables at either the regional-level or the country level. In the case of the neutral trust index, such an effect is only found in South Korea,\n\nalthough in this case the loser dummy variable actually reaches significance only after\n\ntraditional social values is accounted for. For the most part, then, there appears to be no\n\nunique relationship between partisanship and traditional social values.\n\n65\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTaking a holistic look at the findings of this study, in many ways they serve as\n\nvalidations of observable trends in the wider literature. At the same time, this study also\n\nprovides several conclusions that serve to further advance the discussion on institutional\n\ntrust in East and Southeast Asia while providing meaningful avenues of future research.\n\nFirst, in a broad sense, this project provides further insight into the debate over\n\nwhether institutional or cultural factors best explain trends in institutional trust. The\n\nanalysis in this paper was prefaced by the claims of authors (e.g. Wong, Wan, and Hsiao\n\n2011; Wang 2013; Park 2017) about the relative superiority or consistency of the\n\ninstitutional approach to institutional trust. Within that discussion, I asserted, based on\n\nprior literature, that the latter portion of the argument seems a more reasonable claim than\n\nthe former, and the results of this study support that assertion. Consistency is, in fact, the\n\nhallmark of the variables reflective of the institutional approach like evaluations of the\n\nnational economic situation and governmental anti-corruption efforts. In every single\n\nmodel included in this paper, these two variables have a significant, positive impact on\n\ninstitutional trust. Moreover, the standardized coefficients associated with these variables\n\nsuggest that the magnitude of their impact is the largest of any tested variable.\n\nThe consistency of these two variables, and therefore the comparatively higher\n\nconsistency of the institutional approach, is further highlighted by the lack of consistency\n\ndisplayed by the variables attempting to tap into social capital. For both social trust and\n\norganizational membership, there is a much greater level of variation in significance from\n\n66\n\nmodel to model and from country to country. This is, admittedly, not surprising given the\n\ninconsistent conclusions the wider literature reaches about these variables, but the fact\n\nthat this inconsistently remains apparent when controlling for a wider number of\n\nvariables than much of the literature does lend further credence to voices that downplay\n\nthe role of social capital in shaping institutional trust in East and Southeast Asia.\n\nMoreover, there appears to be only marginal support for the role that different\n\noperationalizations of social trust play in explaining some of this variance. While\n\nutilizing an alternative operationalization of social trust on the same data set, the general\n\nprocess modeled off the work of Mujani and Liddle (2013), does alter the significance of\n\nsocial trust in a subset of the countries studied, it is not a comprehensive explanation. As\n\nsuch, it seems reasonable to largely accept the literature’s preference for the institutional\n\napproach.\n\nAt the same time, there are some findings that prompt pushback on a blanket\n\nassertion that the institutional approach is clearly superior to the cultural approach as\n\ncompared to acknowledging that the cultural approach does provide some value. In\n\nparticular, the conclusions that we can draw about traditional social values from this\n\nstudy reflect positively on the cultural approach. Whereas social trust and organizational\n\nmembership fail to reach a significant level of certainty in many of the models tested,\n\ntraditional social values almost always have a significant, positive impact on institutional\n\ntrust. Behind evaluations of the national economic situation and governmental anti corruption efforts, traditional social values are actually the most consistent variable tested\n\nin the entire study. While the wider literature on the topic of traditionalism is much more\n\nmixed, because the results of this study were found using the same operationalization but\n\n67\n\na newer set of data than Ikeda (2013), it seems reasonable to conclude that much of the\n\ndiscrepancy in the conclusions drawn about traditional social values are due to issues\n\nwith operationalization rather than intrinsic issues that might suggest a lack of a\n\nrelationship between traditional social values and institutional trust.\n\nMore broadly, these findings offer a mixed picture on the long-term prospects of\n\ninstitutional trust in the region. Considering their findings on partisanship, Huang, Lee,\n\nand Lin (2013) take a relatively negative tact, arguing that, “… the implications of our\n\nfindings seem pessimistic. If institutional trust is subject to partisan projection, there is a\n\nlimit to what a democratic government can do to improve trust by improving\n\ngovernance,” (pg. 67). To some extent, these same fears exist with the findings in this\n\nstudy. Partisanship does seem to play a role in shaping levels of trust in the region. At the\n\nsame time, this relationship does not hold true for each country or each type of\n\ninstitution, and even in those it does the magnitude of this relationship is smaller than\n\nmany other variables. Moreover, the two most consistent and influential determinants of\n\ninstitutional trust, evaluations of the national economic situation and perceptions of anti corruption efforts, are much more closely associated with governmental performance.\n\nCertainly, there are factors outside the influence of governments that can negatively\n\nimpact economic growth, but those concerned about increasing levels of institutional trust\n\nshould take heart in the fact that institutional trust does still appear to be tied closely to\n\ngood governance. What might be more concerning in the long run is the relationship\n\nbetween traditional social values and institutional trust. If one assumes that these\n\ntraditional values will decay over time, this presents a source of further decline in\n\n68\n\ninstitutional trust that may be difficult for governments to address. More research is likely\n\nnecessary to determine if such a trend exists.\n\nThis study also provides additional avenues for further research. First, in line with\n\nthe necessity of further research tracking the level of traditional social values in the\n\nregion, traditional social values should feature much more prominently in any future\n\nresearch on institutional trust in East and Southeast Asia. At the same time, this study\n\nutilizes a relatively straightforward operationalization of traditional social values. It\n\nwould likely be worthwhile to disaggregate traditional social values further, as Zhai\n\n(2016) does when disaggregating traditional social values in China into family, social,\n\nand political values. There are also several variables discussed in the literature review\n\nthat were, unfortunately, not included in this study that warrant further testing. These\n\ninclude testing to see to what extent the electoral systems utilized influence levels of\n\ninstitutional trust, the extent to which the proportionality of electoral outcomes influences\n\ninstitutional trust, and whether a more comprehensive definition of media consumption\n\nwould lead to more consistent conclusions about the impact of the variable than currently\n\nexist in the wider literature and address the discrepancies about the variable that exist\n\nbetween the East Asian and African literature on trust. The more expansive models\n\nutilized in this study are a good first step, but further progress can be made on uniformly\n\ntesting competing explanations about the determinants of institutional trust within any\n\nsingle study.\n\nAdditionally, there are some methodological aspects utilized in this project that\n\neither warrant further study or should be more commonly incorporated in the literature on\n\nthe topic. The differences in results between partisan and neutral institutions explored in\n\n69\n\nChapter 2 lend further credence to the assertion made by Huang, Lee, and Lin (2013) that\n\nthe relationship between partisanship and institutional trust needs to be accounted for in\n\nmore studies. At the same time, it was not only the relationship between partisanship and\n\ninstitutional trust that varied when looking at partisan versus neutral institutions. This\n\nsuggests that, regardless of whether partisanship is being investigated in a study, there is\n\nvalue in carving out this distinction between types of institutions. Of course, the\n\ndifferences in the significance of other determinants between partisan and neutral\n\ninstitutions may not be linked to their partisan or non-partisan nature, but at the very least\n\nthis point supports my earlier claim that studies should be taking into account a greater\n\nnumber of institutions when defining institutional trust; a measure looking at views for\n\nonly one or two institutions simply can’t pick up any such potential variation.\n\nAltogether, this study has provided valuable insights on both the institutional and\n\ncultural approaches to institutional trust. It has confirmed the importance of testing both\n\npartisanship and traditional social values as determinants of institutional trust in East and\n\nSoutheast Asia. And, more broadly, it has explored some of the implications of the\n\nvarying methodologies that have been used in the wider literature while providing some\n\nsuggestions on areas where progress can be made on standardizing approaches. Issues of\n\ninstitutional trust will likely maintain their importance in the years to come, and further\n\nresearch, both on the regional and at the country level, will be necessary to continue to\n\nimprove our understanding of the topic.\n\n70\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nAnderson, C.J., A.

XXXVIII (167), 2003, 443-465\n\nA confiança nos parlamentos nacionais: regras institucionais, representação e responsabilização política\n\nA confiança que os cidadãos depositam nas instituições políticas tem vindo a tornar-se um tópico de crescente interesse para a ciência política. Desde finais da década de 90, a emergência de novos regimes democráticos por toda a Europa de Leste suscitou preocupações quanto à sua sobrevivência e desempenho em países que partilham um chamado «legado leninista» (Jowitt, 1999). Apesar das importantes diferenças entre países, estas novas democracias têm sido caracterizadas, de acordo com diversos estudos, por uma fraca «cultura política democrática», uma tradição jurídica de flagrante desrespeito pelos valores do Estado de direito, valores iliberais de intolerância e atitudes de um ostensivo cinismo político — ou, pelo menos, de um profundo cepticismo — em relação aos partidos, aos políticos e à maior parte das instituições sociais e políticas (Rothschild e Wingfield, 1993; Mishler e Rose, 1997). Contudo, o contraste entre estes novos regimes democráticos e o Ocidente industrializado não é tão claro como poderíamos supor. Embora alguns estudos feitos com base em dados dos anos 70 e 80 tenham mostrado poucas mudanças no que respeita à confiança dos cidadãos nas instituições políticas na maioria das democracias da Europa ocidental (Listhaug e Wiberg, 1995), os anos 90 são vistos de modo quase unânime como um período de viragem a esse respeito. Ao examinar as tendências nos padrões de confiança nas instituições sociais e políticas em dezassete democracias desde inícios dos anos 80 até inícios dos anos 90, Pippa Norris concluía que «o apoio institucional diminuiu em cada um dos países comparados, se bem que, de um modo geral, apenas ligeiramente» (Norris, 1999, p. 227). Mas outros\n\n* Instituto de Ciências Sociais da Universidade de Lisboa.\n\n444\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\nautores detectaram tendências ainda mais fortes de declínio da confiança institucional não apenas nos Estados Unidos, como também em muitas democracias europeias, particularmente no que diz respeito a atitudes de apoio aos parlamentos (Rosenstone e Hansen, 1993; Craig, 1993; Pharr, Dalton e Putnam, 2000). Um declínio nos níveis de confiança depositada pelos cidadãos nas suas instituições políticas e cívicas terá de ser visto com alguma preocupação. A democracia representativa é, em grande medida, um acto de delegação condicional do poder por parte dos cidadãos em agentes políticos. Tipicamente, as democracias concedem aos eleitores mecanismos por meio dos quais podem seleccionar esses agentes e controlar o seu comportamento, reduzindo não apenas as probabilidades de que venham a ter preferências divergentes da maioria dos cidadãos, como também de que venham a usar o poder principalmente para servirem os seus interesses pessoais (Strøm, 2000). Deste ponto de vista, um determinado grau de «desconfiança institucional» poderá não ser surpreendente nem mesmo nocivo, tendo em conta a pouca informação que os cidadãos têm sobre aquilo que os governos fazem (Hardin, 1999). No entanto, a prevalência de atitudes de desconfiança para com as instituições políticas também pode contribuir para minar a democracia representativa e o seu desempenho político e económico. A ausência de uma certa margem de manobra para os governantes democráticos tende a exacerbar a influência dos objectivos eleitorais de curto prazo sobre o comportamento político, estimulando uma preocupação permanente com a consulta dos eleitores, mesmo quando as eleições estão ainda distantes. A potencial consequência é a redução dos incentivos para o estabelecimento de compromissos políticos claros por parte dos políticos, assim como a anulação da própria razão de ser da delegação política implícita no conceito de democracia representativa (Mishler e Rose, 1997; Hetherington, 1998; Strøm, 2000). Para além disso, a criação de um ambiente de desconfiança social em relação aos políticos e às instituições pode também encorajar a crescente importância das personalidades e das reputações na competição política, reduzindo o conteúdo informativo das eleições no que respeita às propostas políticas dos candidatos e, desse modo, afectando a qualidade da representação e da responsabilização política. A desconfiança nas instituições pode até minar a confiança entre os cidadãos, sugerindo aos eleitores que os seus concidadãos poderão obter vantagens indevidas por parte de um governo no qual não se pode confiar (Rothstein, 2001). Um baixo nível de confiança no parlamento deverá, provavelmente, ser visto como um fenómeno particularmente perturbante. De facto, embora pareça inegável que o papel dos parlamentos no processo legislativo terá\n\n445\n\nA confiança nos parlamentos nacionais\n\n«declinado», diversos estudiosos têm apontado como eles desempenham outras funções cruciais dentro do sistema político. Ao analisar um tal «declínio» no caso do parlamento britânico, Beer sugeriu que um dos papéis cruciais dos parlamentos continuava a ser o da «mobilização de consentimento» entre os períodos eleitorais, ao contribuírem para «um intercâmbio contínuo de comunicações» entre o governo e o público (Beer, 1966, p. 46). Similarmente, Packenham defendeu que uma das funções dos parlamentos era a de produzirem «entre o povo e as elites relevantes um sentido mais amplo e profundo do direito moral do governo para governar», além de desempenharem uma função legitimadora, ao «colocarem o selo de aprovação legislativo em iniciativas tomadas noutros contextos» (Packenham, 1970, p. 527; v. também Mishler e Rose, 1994). Todavia, este entendimento dos papéis dos parlamentos levanta outra questão particularmente perturbadora: como poderá um parlamento contribuir para a construção de uma base de apoio a um regime e para a mobilização de consentimento para as decisões governamentais se ele próprio é visto como uma instituição indigna de confiança?\n\nEXPLICAR A CONFIANÇA INSTITUCIONAL: CULTURA, APOIO ESPECÍFICO E NORMAS INSTITUCIONAIS\n\nO que poderá explicar o nível de confiança que os cidadãos depositam no seu parlamento? A bibliografia existente avança três conjuntos principais de hipóteses: valores e atitudes culturais; desempenho do governo e apoio específico; e o papel das regras institucionais. A noção de que as atitudes e valores políticos são produzidos pela socialização política — o resultado de experiências de vida ligadas a posições sociais determinadas pelo sexo, pela classe social e pela idade — é tudo menos nova na ciência política (Almond e Verba, 1963; Eckstein, 1966). Contudo, alguns estudos recentes têm relacionado explicitamente o declínio da confiança nas instituições políticas nas democracias ocidentais com mudanças estruturais na cultura política, sugerindo que as evoluções ao nível dos valores e padrões dominantes da socialização se reflectirão inevitavelmente no grau de apoio concedido às instituições democráticas. Esta perspectiva apresenta duas vertentes principais. De acordo com Putnam, o declínio da confiança depositada pelos cidadãos nas instituições e nos agentes políticos pode ser parcialmente atribuído à erosão da família e dos laços comunitários, bem como ao papel desempenhado pelos meios de comunicação de massas (especialmente a televisão) nas actividades de lazer e na socialização política (Putnam, 1995a; Pharr, Dalton e Putnam, 2000). Por um lado, a crescente separação entre os cidadãos e as suas famílias,\n\n446\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\namigos e vizinhos terá conduzido a um declínio do capital social e, desse modo, das «redes, normas e confiança social que facilitam a coordenação e cooperação para benefício mútuo», que, por sua vez, está altamente correlacionado com um afastamento psicológico relativamente à política e à governação (Putnam, 1995a). Por outro lado, os meios de comunicação, e a televisão em particular, terão reforçado estas tendências não apenas mediante a exposição dos cidadãos a retratos negativos da esfera política, mas também através da substituição de outras actividades cívicas por formas de lazer «privatizadas» e «individualistas» (Putnam, 1995b; Brehm e Rahn, 1998; Campbell, Yonish e Putnam, 1999). Outra vertente desta perspectiva culturalista é a que tem sido desenvolvida de modo mais proeminente por Ronald Inglehart. De acordo com este autor, o crescimento económico, o bem-estar e a expansão dos níveis de instrução terão conduzido a uma mudança cultural «pós-moderna» nas nações mais desenvolvidas, particularmente entre os estratos mais jovens. Uma das principais características da «pós-modernização» é o modo como retira importância a «todos os tipos de autoridade, seja ela religiosa ou secular, permitindo um campo muito mais amplo de autonomia individual na procura do bem-estar subjectivo individual» (Inglehart, 1999, p. 238). No que toca às atitudes perante as instituições, estas tendências terão conduzido a um crescente apoio à democracia como regime político, mas também a um declínio na confiança depositada nas instituições hierárquicas tradicionais e no governo em geral. Um segundo tipo de explicação para a confiança depositada nas instituições democráticas relaciona-a, não com valores culturais, mas antes com o apoio específico concedido pelos cidadãos ao sistema político. A ideia de «apoio específico» refere-se ao grau de satisfação dos cidadãos perante o desempenho das instituições políticas, a forma como o governo responde às exigências sociais e os benefícios e custos que distribui (Easton, 1965). Embora a distinção entre apoio «específico» e apoio «difuso» — «o grau de simpatia geral por objectos políticos [...] não condicionado por proveitos específicos num dado momento» (Easton, 1965, p. 268) — seja conceptualmente clara, há fortes razões para crer que a confiança e o apoio específico e difuso se encontram fortemente interligados. A combinação de frustrações de curto prazo com o desempenho do sistema político é em si mesma uma experiência de socialização política que, provavelmente, dará forma a atitudes de longo prazo para com os políticos e as instituições (Mishler e Rose, 1997). Níveis de performance económica persistentemente baixos, por exemplo, poderão minar o apoio ao regime e a sua legitimidade, independentemente das características institucionais e de outros aspectos da performance política desse mesmo regime (Przeworski et al., 1997). Foi até já demonstrado que, mesmo nos regimes democráticos consolidados, a performance\n\n447\n\nA confiança nos parlamentos nacionais\n\neconómica e as avaliações subjectivas da economia têm um impacto pelo menos modesto — mas sempre significativo — sobre as atitudes de confiança no governo e nas instituições políticas (Citrin, 1974; Citrin e Green, 1986; Clarke, Dutt e Kornberg, 1993; McAllister, 1999). Além do mais, o «apoio específico» deve ainda ser entendido na sua relação com a avaliação subjectiva do governo e seu desempenho. Como afirma Hetherington (1998), «uma vez que o governo é em grande medida composto por instituições operadas por incumbentes, os sentimentos que ambos suscitam deverão explicar a confiança». Como destacam Anderson e Guillory, «as pessoas que votaram num partido do governo — seja ele o partido do governo ou um entre os diversos partidos de uma coligação governante — são, quase por definição, mais propensas a acreditarem que o governo está interessado em conhecer as suas necessidades e em dar resposta às mesmas» (Anderson e Guillory, 1997, p. 68; v. também Norris, 1999, p. 220). Na realidade, há até outra variável que poderá relacionar-se de uma forma ainda mais forte com o apoio ao sistema e a confiança institucional: em vez do voto no partido do governo nas anteriores eleições, a intenção de voto no partido do governo caso venha a haver eleições. Finalmente, um terceiro conjunto de hipóteses de explicação da confiança institucional relaciona-a com as próprias regras institucionais vigentes em cada regime democrático. Estas disposições institucionais têm sido classificadas de diferentes formas, e de modo mais proeminente por Lijphart, que as divide em dois modelos básicos: democracia maioritária versus democracia consensual. O princípio organizador subjacente à democracia maioritária é a concentração do poder nas mãos de uma maioria, e as características institucionais básicas deste tipo ideal são os governos maioritários de partido único, domínio do executivo sobre o parlamento, sistemas bipartidários, sistemas eleitorais maioritários, sistemas de grupos de interesses pluralistas, regimes unitários, unicameralismo ou bicameralismo assimétrico, constituições flexíveis, ausência de revisão judicial e bancos centrais dependentes. Pelo contrário, o princípio organizador da democracia consensual é partilhar, dispersar e limitar o poder político. As características institucionais básicas do tipo ideal de democracia consensual são a divisão do poder por coligações multipartidárias, um equilíbrio de poder executivo-legislativo, sistemas multipartidários, sistemas eleitorais de representação proporcional, corporativismo, federalismo, bicameralismo simétrico e incongruente, constituições rígidas com fiscalização judicial da constitucionalidade e bancos centrais independentes (Lijphart, 1999). Os modelos consensual e maioritário de Lijphart coexistem com outras tipologias, entre as quais o contraste estabelecido por Powell entre as concepções «maioritária» e «proporcional» de democracia (Powell, 2000). Contudo, nem o princípio organizador geral da tipologia (concentração versus\n\n448\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\ndispersão do poder) nem as expectativas a respeito do seu impacto sobre as atitudes perante as instituições diferem de modo significativo dos propostos por Lijphart. Em primeiro lugar, as democracias consensuais, ao favorecerem uma representação parlamentar mais perfeita dos diferentes interesses sociais e preferências políticas da sociedade, têm mais probabilidades de suscitarem um apoio político e confiança institucional mais alargados (Norris, 1999). Em segundo lugar, e na medida em que dispersam o poder, favorecem a partilha do poder dentro do executivo e fortalecem a influência das oposições na determinação das orientações políticas, as democracias consensuais proporcionam aos «perdedores» mais do que uma mera representação simbólica: proporcionam-lhes voz activa nas decisões políticas, contribuindo para atenuar «as consequências negativas de uma derrota eleitoral» (Anderson e Guillory, 1997, p. 68). Finalmente, as democracias que encorajam a dispersão e a partilha de poder parecem funcionar melhor em termos da criação de governos ou de coligações políticas cujas preferências se encontram consistentemente próximas do eleitor médio (Huber e Powell, 1994; Powell, 2000). Assim, não surpreende que os regimes democráticos «consensuais» pareçam estar empiricamente associados não apenas a níveis mais elevados de satisfação com a democracia (Lijphart, 1999), mas também a diferenças mais reduzidas entre os níveis de satisfação dos «vencedores» e dos «perdedores» (Anderson e Guillory, 1997). Não obstante, a noção de que as instituições da democracias consensuais deveriam gerar níveis mais elevados de confiança institucional, particularmente no que diz respeito aos parlamentos, encerra um aspecto algo desconcertante. Um dos argumentos teóricos fundamentais a favor da democracia maioritária continua a ser o de que, do ponto de vista dos cidadãos, aquela permite identificar com muito maior clareza os detentores do poder. E isto, por sua vez, facilita a tarefa enfrentada pelos cidadãos quando têm de decidir se devem recompensar ou punir os agentes políticos pelo seu desempenho. Como faz notar Powell, «se todos os recursos necessários para a determinação da orientação política forem controlados por um conjunto unificado, identificável, de políticos eleitos, será fácil os cidadãos identificarem esses políticos como os responsáveis pelas políticas adoptadas» (Powell, 2000, p. 51). Por conseguinte, na medida em que a capacidade para responsabilizar os políticos é valorizada pelos eleitores e afecta as suas atitudes políticas para com as instituições governamentais, seria de esperar que pelo menos alguns dos elementos da democracia maioritária aumentassem a confiança no parlamento e nas restantes instituições políticas. Assim, por que será que não parece acontecer isto? Uma resposta possível é que, simplesmente, a responsabilização política não tem importância no que toca à formação de atitudes de confiança nas instituições. Contudo, outra resposta inteiramente diferente é que, enquanto as\n\n449\n\nA confiança nos parlamentos nacionais\n\nnormas institucionais que facilitam a responsabilização eleitoral dos governantes são de facto importantes quando pretendemos explicar donde provém a confiança política, o seu impacto tem permanecido oculto. Em Elections as Instruments of Democracy Powell classifica as configurações constitucionais de vinte democracias de acordo com dois critérios principais: regras eleitorais e regras de decisão política (Powell, 2000, pp. 20-43). Até hoje, e no que toca aos factores institucionais que explicam as atitudes políticas, os estudiosos têm-se concentrado principalmente no impacto ou das regras eleitorais ou da combinação entre essas e as regras de decisão política (Anderson e Guillory, 1997; Lijphart, 1999; Norris, 1999). Todavia, trata-se de dimensões independentes dos tipos gerais de configuração constitucional que favorecem quer a concepção «proporcional», quer a concepção «maioritária» de democracia. Como tem sido abundantemente debatido na literatura especializada, as democracias cujas regras eleitorais permitem equidade no modo de representação dos pequenos partidos e das diferentes opiniões do eleitorado podem de facto exibir níveis mais elevados de confiança institucional. Contudo, e independentemente das regras eleitorais, as democracias com regras de decisão política que multiplicam o número de pontos de veto institucionais são propensas a criarem importantes obstáculos à «responsabilidade vertical» dos representantes perante os eleitores (Strøm, 2000) e, desse modo, a minarem a confiança nos parlamentos. Será esta a hipótese geral que iremos testar na próxima secção do presente estudo.\n\nA VARIÁVEL DEPENDENTE: CONFIANÇA NO PARLAMENTO EM CATORZE DEMOCRACIAS EUROPEIAS\n\nAs sondagens do Eurobarómetro fornecem uma fonte de dados particularmente útil de variáveis a nível individual, como a informação sócio-demográfica e atitudes e comportamentos políticos. No presente estudo utilizo dados do Eurobarómetro 51.0, um conjunto de inquéritos de opinião conduzidos em catorze nações democráticas da União Europeia entre Março e Maio de 19991. Nesses inquéritos pediu-se aos inquiridos de cada país que declarassem o seu grau de confiança em dezassete instituições políticas e cívicas diferentes, desde as Nações Unidas à Igreja, sendo-lhes dadas duas opções de resposta: «tende a confiar» ou «tende a não confiar» nessas instituições. A figura n.º 1 mostra a percentagem de inquiridos de cada país que afirmaram tender a confiar no seu parlamento nacional.\n\n1 Os inquiridos da Irlanda do Norte e do Luxemburgo foram excluídos, os primeiros devido ao seu contexto político particular e os segundos devido à pequena dimensão da amostra.\n\n450\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\nA figura n.º 1 mostra diferenças substanciais entre países no que toca à confiança dos cidadãos no parlamento. A percentagem de inquiridos que responderam que «tendem a confiar» no seu parlamento nacional oscila entre os 62,1% na Holanda e os 26,3% na Bélgica. Um contraste interessante — e de algum modo previsível — é apresentado pelas respostas dadas pelas duas amostras representativas da Alemanha Ocidental e da Alemanha Oriental. Na Alemanha Ocidental cerca de 46,3% dos inquiridos afirmam tender a confiar no parlamento, contra apenas 36,1% na Alemanha Oriental. A figura n.º 1 sugere ainda que, por volta de finais da década de 90, a confiança nos parlamentos nacionais entre os países da UE registava níveis relativamente modestos. Infelizmente, a formulação da questão utilizada no inquérito impossibilita a comparação entre estes dados e outros recolhidos anteriormente no âmbito de projectos comparativos, como o World Values Survey ou o European Values Study, em que se pedia aos inquiridos que respondessem a uma questão similar mediante uma escala de 4 pontos. No entanto, a média de cidadãos que responderam tender a confiar no parlamento em 1999 era inferior a 50% (43,8%, com um desvio-padrão de 10,4%). De facto, apenas em quatro países (Holanda, Portugal, Finlândia e Dinamarca) mais de metade dos inquiridos responderam que tendiam a confiar nos respectivos parlamentos nacionais. Outro passo importante no exame preliminar dos dados disponíveis diz respeito à relação entre a confiança depositada no parlamento e a depositada\n\n62 61\n\n56 55 54 51\n\n47 45 45 42\n\n37 36 36\n\n28 26\n\n[FIGURA N.º 1] 70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nHolanda\n\nLuxemburgo\n\nPortugal\n\nFinlândia\n\nDinamarca\n\nGrécia\n\nÁustria\n\nEspanha\n\nAlemanha\n\nSuécia\n\nFrança\n\nIrlanda\n\nReino Unido\n\nItália\n\nBélgica\n\n62 61\n\n56 55 54 51 47 45 45 42 37 36 36\n\n28 26\n\nConfiança no parlamento nos países da União Europeia (1999)\n\n451\n\nA confiança nos parlamentos nacionais\n\nnoutras instituições políticas e cívicas. Existem diversas razões pelas quais devemos esperar encontrar pequenas diferenças em termos de atitudes individuais de confiança e desconfiança perante instituições diferentes. Em primeiro lugar, e a julgar pelas hipóteses teóricas construídas na base da abordagem cultural da confiança institucional, é pouco provável que as experiências de socialização e posição social sejam de molde a predisporem um indivíduo particular a depositar um elevado grau de confiança num conjunto específico de instituições civis e políticas e a desconfiar profundamente de outras (Mishler e Rose, 2001). Em segundo lugar, e na medida em que a confiança no governo é afectada pelo apoio específico concedido aos governantes e às suas políticas, os indivíduos que apoiam o governo são, provavelmente, mais propensos a desenvolverem confiança nas instituições políticas no seu todo, particularmente no parlamento e nos partidos, e até mesmo noutras instituições em que o governo poderá ter alguma participação, como o sistema judicial, as forças militares, a polícia ou a União Europeia. Finalmente, e tendo em conta a hipótese sobre a função «legitimadora» dos parlamentos, os níveis de confiança depositada nas legislaturas tenderá a transbordar para um apoio difuso às instituições governamentais no seu conjunto (Packenham, 1970). O quadro n.º 1 apresenta um teste preliminar destas hipóteses. Mostrando os resultados de uma análise de componentes principais da confiança em dezassete instituições diferentes em catorze países da UE, o quadro revela quatro factores principais. O primeiro inclui todas as instituições políticas, nacionais e intergovernamentais, bem como a função pública e — talvez de modo menos previsível — as grandes empresas e os sindicatos. O segundo inclui as instituições «hierárquicas» tradicionais: o exército, a polícia, o sistema legal e a Igreja. O terceiro factor inclui os meios de comunicação de massas, enquanto o último inclui as organizações não governamentais e as organizações de beneficência e de trabalho voluntário. Não obstante, o primeiro factor corresponde por si só a quase 37% da variação total, quase cinco vezes mais do que a percentagem de variação do segundo factor. Além disso, quando olhamos para o modelo de factor único, todas as instituições apresentam valores mais elevados do que 0,5. Assim, similarmente ao que Mishler e Rose encontraram na Europa de Leste (2001, p. 43), os sentimentos de confiança ou desconfiança dos cidadãos dos países da UE nas instituições políticas e civis parecem ser generalizados de instituição para instituição.\n\nVARIÁVEIS INDEPENDENTES DE NÍVEL INDIVIDUAL: VALORES CULTURAIS E APOIO ESPECÍFICO\n\nDe modo a explicar as atitudes de confiança em relação ao parlamento, e para além do rendimento e do sexo (utilizadas como variáveis de controlo sócio-demográficas), utilizamos neste estudo as seguintes variáveis independentes de\n\n452\n\nPedro C.

Segue-se uma breve explicação de cada variável.\n\nDe acordo com as hipóteses básicas de Putnam sobre o declínio do capital social e o seu impacto na confiança institucional, é de esperar que níveis mais elevados de exposição a notícias políticas através da televisão causem também níveis mais elevados de desconfiança nas instituições políticas, em geral, e no parlamento, em particular. Da mesma forma, e na medida em que a ruptura dos laços familiares e comunitários pode contribuir para a redução dos níveis de confiança social e interpessoal, é de esperar que, ceteris paribus, haja mais probabilidades de os indivíduos que vivem sós apresentarem níveis mais baixos de integração social e, desse modo, depositarem menos confiança nas instituições parlamentares. As hipóteses de Inglehart sobre o impacto da mudança de valores «pós-modernos» nas sociedades industriais podem também ser testadas: se é de esperar que os grupos mais jovens mostrem níveis mais baixos de confiança institucional, o mesmo deverá ocorrer com indivíduos com níveis mais elevados de instrução (Listhaug e Wiberg, 1995; Mishler e Rose, 2001). A hipótese de que a confiança política provém do apoio específico concedido pelos cidadãos aos governantes pode ser testada mediante a avaliação\n\n[QUADRO N.º 1]\n\nParlamento . . . . . . . . . .

A primeira prende-se com a condição corrente de desemprego dos inquiridos.. A segunda diz respeito ao apoio concedido pelos cidadãos aos governantes, apoio esse que é medido através de uma variável dicotómica, como valor de 1 se o inquirido manifesta a intenção de votar num dos partidos correntemente no governo nas próximas eleições gerais e o valor de 0 no caso contrário. Obviamente, espera-se que haja também mais probabilidades de os indivíduos que apoiam o governo e que manifestam uma intenção de voto num dos partidos que correntemente o integram apresentarem níveis elevados de confiança no parlamento. Por fim, testarei o impacto das duas últimas variáveis ligadas às atitudes políticas. Uma delas é a frequência da discussão política, que deverá ter um efeito positivo sobre a confiança institucional. A frequência com que os indivíduos discutem as questões políticas, um indicador do seu interesse pela política, deverá estar associada a um sentido de eficácia política e, assim, a uma visão mais confiante e optimista do funcionamento das instituições democráticas (Weatherford, 1991; Anderson e Guillory, 1997). A segunda variável é o radicalismo ideológico, medido para cada inquirido como o valor absoluto da diferença entre o seu autoposicionamento ideológico numa escala de 1 a 10 e a média do seu país: quanto mais longe do centro e mais perto dos extremos ideológicos os indivíduos se situam ideologicamente, mais baixa deve ser a sua confiança no parlamento (King, 1997). Por meio de regressão logística, regredimos a variável dicotómica «confiança no parlamento» (0, «tende a não confiar»; 1, «tende a confiar») em todas as variáveis de nível individual anteriormente descritas e separadamente para cada país. Os resultados podem ser observados no quadro n.º 2. Como podemos ver no quadro n.º 2, as explicações da confiança institucional com base em valores culturais não parecem sustentáveis no que diz respeito às atitudes para com os parlamentos nacionais nos países da UE. Em primeiro lugar, na maioria dos casos o sinal do coeficiente de exposição aos noticiários televisivos é positivo, e não negativo, e esta variável só produz um impacto significativo sobre a confiança nos casos da Alemanha Oriental, da França e da Suécia. Em segundo lugar, apenas em Portugal os indivíduos que vivem sozinhos mostram atitudes de maior, e não menor, confiança no parlamento, ainda que devamos admitir a forte probabilidade de que esta variável particular seja um mau indicador do conceito relevante (baixo capital social). A análise do impacto da educação sobre a confiança institucional fornece resultados ainda mais desconcertantes à luz das abordagens culturais: os coeficientes para o efeito da educação são significativos em oito dos quinze casos, mas são todos positivos: os indivíduos com maior grau de instrução tendem a confiar mais, e não menos, nos seus parlamentos nacionais. Finalmente, os efeitos da idade revelam-se inconsistentes: positivos em alguns casos (Alemanha Ocidental, Grécia e Espanha), negativos noutros (Ho 454\n\nPedro C.

A discussão política também produz efeitos modestos sobre a confiança institucional. O impacto desta variável é significativo apenas nos países escandinavos (Dinamarca, Finlândia e Suécia), na Itália e em França. Por outro lado, na Grécia, Itália, Espanha, França e Suécia os indivíduos que se posicionam mais longe do centro ideológico dos respectivos países mostram de facto uma propensão para confiarem menos nos seus parlamentos nacionais. Assim, os factores de nível individual que afectam de modo mais consistente e poderoso a confiança que os cidadãos da UE depositam nos seus parlamentos nacionais estão relacionados com o desempenho do governo e a intenção de voto em partidos do governo, por outras palavras, os indicadores de apoio específico. No que diz respeito à situação de desemprego, a direcção da causalidade é a esperada na maioria dos países (negativa), mas estatisticamente significativa apenas na Alemanha Oriental (e, previsivelmente, não na Alemanha Ocidental), Bélgica, Finlândia e Suécia. Contudo, a intenção de voto num dos partidos do governo nas próximas eleições gerais é um bom indicador de confiança no parlamento em todos os casos, com excepção da Irlanda e da Suécia. Por outras palavras, o apoio específico, particularmente a aprovação do trabalho dos governantes e a proximidade aos partidos no governo, é a única explicação da confiança institucional que se revela sólida em quase todos os países da UE, tratando-se, provavelmente, da variável de nível individual com mais influência nas atitudes dos cidadãos de confiança ou desconfiança nas suas instituições políticas e cívicas num dado momento. Isto chama-nos a atenção não apenas para o facto de que a confiança política, tal como expressa nas sondagens pelos inquiridos, pode estar fortemente ligada a factores de curto prazo, como o nível de satisfação com os governantes, mas também para o facto de que a falta de confiança nas instituições políticas pode em parte exprimir a exclusão temporária do governo dos partidos ou líderes preferidos pelos inquiridos.\n\nVARIÁVEIS DE NÍVEL MACRO: A PERFORMANCE ECONÓMICA E AS REGRAS INSTITUCIONAIS\n\nApesar de confirmarem o impacto de algumas variáveis de nível individual sobre a confiança no parlamento, os resultados mostrados no quadro n.º 2 deixam muito por explicar. Como vimos na figura n.º 1, as diferenças entre países em níveis colectivos de confiança são bastante significativas. Este facto sugere que o contexto nacional no qual estão inseridos os cidadãos da UE — definido neste caso pelos indicadores colectivos de performance económica e pelas normas institucionais — pode ajudar-nos a compreender\n\n456\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\na razão pela qual os cidadãos de certos países tendem a mostrar níveis mais elevados de confiança no parlamento do que outros. As variáveis de nível macro que utilizamos no presente estudo são de dois tipos fundamentais. O primeiro tipo diz respeito às variáveis de desempenho económico e inclui o crescimento económico, a taxa de desemprego e a taxa de inflação. O segundo tipo inclui o conjunto de regras institucionais que caracterizam o sistema político de cada país. No que diz respeito às regras eleitorais, utilizo duas variáveis: o grau de desproporcionalidade produzido pelo sistema eleitoral e uma segunda variável — listas fechadas — que distingue os países onde os eleitores são autorizados a exprimirem preferências por candidatos específicos daqueles onde são apenas permitidas escolhas entre listas partidárias. No que diz respeito às regras de decisão política, utilizo três variáveis contextuais: poder das comissões, direitos da oposição e bicameralismo simétrico e incongruente. Finalmente, testo também os efeitos da situação em que os governos são apoiados por um partido ou partidos que formam uma maioria nos parlamentos (governo maioritário). Do ponto de vista da abordagem de apoio específico à confiança institucional, a utilização do crescimento económico e das taxas de desemprego e inflação como variáveis independentes da confiança dos cidadãos no parlamento não necessita de justificações adicionais. Contudo, menos evidente poderá parecer o papel das regras eleitorais e de decisão política na explicação da confiança nas instituições. Os sistemas eleitorais apresentam duas características principais que podem ajudar-nos a avaliar sumariamente o seu funcionamento e impacto potencial. A primeira diz respeito ao grau de desproporcionalidade na distribuição de lugares em relação aos votos. No presente estudo, o grau de desproporcionalidade é simplesmente medido de acordo com o maior desvio entre percentagens de lugares e percentagens de votos nos parlamentos de cada país. Na medida em que a confiança se constrói sobre uma representação parlamentar mais justa dos diversos interesses e perspectivas sociais e, desse modo, sobre a capacidade de eleger deputados de um partido que se encontra razoavelmente próximo das ideias dos eleitores, níveis elevados de desproporcionalidade poderão minar a confiança nas instituições parlamentares. Um segundo aspecto relevante de qualquer sistema eleitoral é o facto de permitir ou não aos eleitores a possibilidade de exprimirem preferências por candidatos específicos. Em alguns países da UE é possível exprimir preferências mediante o voto em candidatos que competem sob rótulos partidários em circunscrições eleitorais uninominais, como nos casos dos sistemas de maioria relativa ou de maioria absoluta a duas voltas e — pelo menos para parte do parlamento — dos sistemas mistos. Noutros casos — em que são utilizadas listas abertas ou semiabertas —, os eleitores podem indicar não\n\n457\n\nA confiança nos parlamentos nacionais\n\napenas o partido preferido, como também os seus candidatos preferidos dentro da lista desse partido. Finalmente, no sistema de voto único transferível utilizado na Irlanda, os eleitores exprimem preferências por candidatos e não por listas partidárias, e a fórmula eleitoral utilizada produz geralmente resultados proporcionais. A capacidade de exprimir preferências por candidatos individuais é, portanto, compatível com sistemas eleitorais que tendem a produzir níveis variáveis de desproporcionalidade. De acordo com a maioria dos observadores, a capacidade de exprimir preferências por candidatos específicos apresenta grandes vantagens relativamente à utilização de listas fechadas de RP tanto em termos de responsabilidade como de representação. Por um lado, num sistema de listas fechadas as hipóteses de reeleição de um candidato particular poderá depender menos do julgamento dos eleitores do que da lealdade partidária, já que são os líderes partidários que controlam a ordem pela qual os candidatos surgem na lista e até mesmo a sua eleição. Além disso, as listas fechadas tendem a obscurecer o currículo dos candidatos individuais, agravando as desvantagens de informação dos eleitores e produzindo incentivos à utilização do poder em proveito próprio. Kunicova e Rose-Ackerman (2001) sugerem mesmo que os sistemas de lista fechada — ao contrário dos sistemas maioritários ou de lista aberta — são mais propensos a exibirem níveis mais elevados de corrupção. Por outro lado, ao contrário do que é provável que aconteça nos sistemas em que os eleitores podem exprimir as suas preferências por candidatos específicos, os representantes eleitos em listas fechadas poderão ter poucos incentivos para permanecerem abertos e atentos àquilo que os seus círculos eleitorais específicos desejam, prejudicando a representação dos interesses locais e aumentando a percepção negativa de que os supostos agentes do povo acabem por servir apenas as suas próprias e egoístas ambições políticas (Kam, 1997). Quatro outras variáveis institucionais podem ajudar-nos a explicar a confiança nos parlamentos, todas elas relacionadas com as regras e condições para a tomada de decisões Ao influenciarem a forma como as políticas tendem a reflectir os interesses das minorias e da oposição, bem como a capacidade dos eleitores para identificarem claramente os responsáveis pela adopção de determinadas políticas e para os recompensarem ou punirem durante os actos eleitorais, as regras de decisão política afectam potencialmente a confiança institucional. Uma dessas variáveis diz respeito ao poder das comissões parlamentares no processo legislativo, como podemos ver no quadro n.º 3. Nos casos em que os parlamentos dispõem de sistemas de comissões especializadas e em que essas comissões gozam de poderes ilimitados para escreverem e alterarem projectos e propostas de lei, a política legislativa torna-se mais sobrecarregada por pontos de veto e é provável que a responsabilização política pelas decisões seja negativamente afectada.\n\n458\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\nPoder das comissões legislativas nos parlamentos da UE\n\nOutra variável potencialmente relevante diz respeito aos direitos da oposição e pode ser medida por um índice construído com base nas respostas a três questões sobre os direitos das oposições: se os partidos que apoiam o executivo carecem de prerrogativas especiais na determinação da agenda legislativa (Döring, 1995, p. 225); se os membros dos partidos da oposição podem presidir a comissões; se os partidos da oposição gozam do direito de produzirem relatórios nas comissões. O quadro n.º 4 descreve estas características nos diferentes países que integram a nossa amostra. Finalmente, uma terceira variável relativa às normas de decisão política distingue os países que têm bicameralismo simétrico incongruente (na nossa amostra, apenas a Alemanha e a Bélgica) daqueles que o não têm. Assim, a hipótese principal que testamos é que, independentemente das normas eleitorais de cada país, a responsabilidade dos governos será negativamente afectada nos países onde o controlo da maioria sobre o processo legislativo é dificultado pela presença de um forte sistema de comissões, uma oposição com direitos alargados e uma poderosa câmara alta com uma composição política diferente da câmara baixa. Na medida em que as atitudes dos cidadãos para com o parlamento são afectadas pela possibilidade de assegurar a «responsabilidade vertical» dos governos, é de esperar que a confiança institucional seja mais baixa nestes casos. Finalmente, testa-se também o impacto de uma última variável macro que se prende com o facto de o governo de cada país ser ou não apoiado no\n\n[QUADRO N.º 3]\n\nBélgica . . . . . . . . . . . . .

De acordo com Listhaug e Wiberg, é de esperar que os governos de partido único ou de coligação maioritária representem para os eleitores uma maior garantia de estabilidade política e de governabilidade, gerando níveis mais elevados de confiança institucional (1995, pp. 310-312).\n\nDireitos da oposição nos parlamentos da UE\n\nO quadro n.º 5 mostra os resultados de uma regressão logística com que se pretendem testar os efeitos de nível individual e macro sobre a confiança no parlamento. De modo a testar a solidez destas relações e os efeitos das variáveis contextuais, concebi um modelo com base nas amostras conjugadas das sondagens do Eurobarómetro, excluindo apenas a Irlanda do Norte e o Luxemburgo. Com uma amostra de tão grandes dimensões são de esperar níveis elevados de significância estatística e efeitos relativamente fracos de cada variável. Porém, os resultados apresentam pistas interessantes relativamente àquelas variáveis que parecem exercer influência sobre o confiança no parlamento, bem como sobre o poder relativo de cada variável. Como vimos na análise multivariada de países individuais do quadro n.º 2, os efeitos das variáveis associadas aos valores culturais e à socialização são fracos ou inexistentes.

Já o radicalismo ideológico surte o efeito esperado, diminuindo a confiança nas instituições parlamentares, um efeito que permanece razoavelmente forte mesmo depois de controlada a desproporcionalidade do sistema eleitoral. Entre as variáveis ligadas à performance e ao apoio específico, o crescimento do PIB e a inflação não produzem efeitos significativos. Contudo, o mesmo não acontece no que diz respeito ao desemprego. Tanto a experiência do desemprego por parte dos inquiridos como a taxa de desemprego de cada país produzem um impacto negativo sobre a confiança depositada na legislatura. Para além disso, é o apoio ao governo que revela o mais forte impacto de entre este conjunto de variáveis, como, de facto, de entre as variáveis de todo o modelo. Os indivíduos que exprimem uma intenção de voto em qualquer dos partidos que integram o governo — uma expressão de identificação partidária e/ou de satisfação com a performance do governo — revelam uma propensão muito maior para confiarem no parlamento do que os restantes. No entanto, as regras institucionais também têm um forte efeito sobre os níveis de confiança depositada pelos cidadãos no seu parlamento, independentemente da performance do governo e do apoio específico. No que diz respeito às regras e condições de tomada de decisões políticas, a confiança dos cidadãos nas instituições legislativas regista um aumento significativo quando os governos beneficiam do apoio parlamentar de um partido ou coligação de maioria absoluta, bem como quando a vontade dessa maioria não é limitada por pontos de veto institucionais, como fortes comissões legislativas ou poderosas segundas câmaras de composição política incongruente em relação à primeira câmara. No que diz respeito às normas eleitorais, uma maior desproporcionalidade na conversão de votos em assentos parlamentares produz níveis mais baixos de confiança política no parlamento, mesmo que o impacto dessa variável seja modesto. Deste modo, a confiança dos cidadãos nos parlamentos parece ver-se de algum modo reforçada pelas normas eleitorais que encorajam uma representação mais exacta dos partidos e interesses sociais, mas seriamente enfraquecida por regras de decisão política que, uma vez celebradas as eleições, provocam a dispersão do poder e obscurecem a responsabilidade dos governantes pelos resultados. Finalmente, a possibilidade de exprimir preferências por candidatos individuais parece reduzir, em vez de aumentar, os níveis de confiança no parlamento. Embora talvez inesperados, estes resultados complementam as conclusões a que chegaram Curtice e Shively a propósito do surpreendente impacto negativo da existência de circunscrições eleitorais uninominais sobre a satisfação dos cidadãos com a democracia (v. artigo publicado neste nú 462\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\nmero da Análise Social). De facto, é possível imaginar duas razões principais pelas quais os efeitos das normas eleitorais que permitem a expressão de preferências por candidatos individuais podem ser negativos para a confiança institucional. Por um lado, a maior necessidade do apoio dos eleitorados locais para assegurar a reeleição traz consigo o espectro da perda de coesão intrapartidária. De modo a evitá-la, os líderes dos partidos podem ser forçados a tratar grupos de deputados que representam interesses de círculos eleitorais localizados como «pontos de veto internos» num grupo parlamentar, capazes de bloquearem medidas prometidas nos programas políticos nacionais dos partidos e de venderem o seu apoio a troco de benefícios políticos, que serão utilizados na mobilização de um tipo de particularismo local que tenderá a reforçar ainda mais a independência desses deputados relativamente à liderança do partido. A consequente dispersão intrapartidária do poder permite a responsabilização de deputados individuais, mas impede a responsabilização eleitoral do partido no seu conjunto. Finalmente, se bem que possam criar obstáculos à representação adequada dos interesses locais, as listas fechadas permitem também aos partidos assegurarem de modo deliberado e eficaz que a representação seja equilibrada em termos de sexo, região, religião, etnia ou quaisquer outros critérios, especialmente se tal equilíbrio for entendido como um benefício eleitoral ou se for necessário dar atenção a importantes clivagens sociais que possam minar o apoio ao regime. Em contrapartida, a capacidade de exprimir preferências por candidatos individuais dentro de uma lista partidária poderá ser utilizada para despromover candidatos pertencentes a minorias sociais, e as circunscrições uninominais só muito raramente oferecerão incentivos ou possibilidades eleitorais para a produção de uma oferta partidária equilibrada à escala nacional em termos da sua representação social (Norris, 1997; Matland, 1999).\n\nDISCUSSÃO\n\nOs resultados deste estudo sugerem que a confiança ou desconfiança em relação às instituições parlamentares são atitudes políticas culturalmente difusas, em grande medida sem relação com as posições sociais e as experiências de socialização de longo prazo dos indivíduos. Uma vez que estes potenciais factores causais não são susceptíveis de mudanças de curto prazo, a sua debilidade enquanto variáveis explicativas da confiança nos parlamentos oferece uma mensagem de optimismo aos responsáveis políticos e aos cidadãos preocupados com o declínio dessa confiança. Além disso, tendo em conta que os níveis de instrução continuam a crescer nas democracias industrializadas, os resultados sugerem que não existe uma correspondência inevitável entre o aumento de recursos educativos e o crescimento das atitudes de cepticismo político perante todas as instituições sociais e políticas.\n\n463\n\nA confiança nos parlamentos nacionais\n\nOs resultados apontam também para a possibilidade de um «círculo virtuoso» entre a satisfação com o desempenho do governo, a confiança no parlamento e a confiança geral nas instituições politicas (Hetherington, 1998). Os sentimentos positivos em relação aos partidos no governo e a capacidade de alcançar níveis elevados de desempenho económico — particularmente na luta contra a exclusão do mercado de trabalho — parecem gerar níveis mais elevados de confiança nos parlamentos. De acordo com as abordagens «multifuncionalistas» aos papéis das legislaturas, os corpos representativos que são considerados dignos de confiança e legítimos podem fazer aumentar a confiança e legitimidade da globalidade das instituições civis e políticas. E esta confiança institucional geral fornece aos governos uma reserva de apoio que lhes permite escapar a preocupações de curto prazo associadas às eleições, encorajando potencialmente uma governação mais eficaz. Obviamente, a capacidade de entrar neste círculo virtuoso poderá ser dificultada por diversos factores que estão para além do controlo dos actores políticos. Não obstante, há opções que podem ser feitas de molde a encorajar a confiança em instituições políticas como o parlamento. Tais opções dizem respeito às regras eleitorais e de decisão política. Corroborando aquilo que começa a fazer parte do senso comum a este nível, os resultados deste estudo apontam para os importantes méritos de alguns aspectos das chamadas democracias consensuais, em particular na promoção da confiança institucional. Aliás, uma das implicações da noção de que os eleitores depositam mais confiança no parlamento quando «o seu partido» está no governo serve apenas para reforçar a natureza propícia à criação de confiança que é própria da lógica subjacente ao modelo da democracia consensual: aumentar a dimensão e representatividade das maiorias, em vez de «se satisfazer com estreitas maiorias de decisão» (Lijphart, 1999). Contudo, consequências muito diferentes resultam de um outra característica das democracias consensuais: a imposição de limites à orientação política do governo mediante a presença de pontos de veto institucionais. Os sistemas políticos onde existem sistemas de fortes comissões legislativas e onde os parlamentos se dividem em câmaras simétricas e incongruentes caracterizam-se por níveis mais baixos de confiança institucional nos corpos legislativos. Assim, a presença de fortes mecanismos de controlo institucionais pode embaraçar fortemente a «responsabilidade vertical» dos governantes, tornando as eleições menos decisivas, obscurecendo a responsabilidade política pelas decisões e abrindo amplas oportunidades à «fuga à responsabilidade».\n\n464\n\nPedro C.

Todavia, este tem sido,\n\ndesde o dealbar do milénio, objeto de reformas institucionais que visam, através das\n\nchamadas petições eletrónicas (petições-E), impulsionar o envolvimento dos cidadãos.\n\nEste trabalho oferece uma grelha para avaliar a eficácia dos sistemas de petições\n\nparlamentares, tendo a análise realizada ao nível dos parlamentos da UE mostrado a\n\nimportância das ferramentas institucionais ligadas às petições-E. Recorremos em\n\nparticular ao caso português para aferir o impacto das petições-E, nomeadamente ao nível\n\ndo comportamento dos principais atores deste direito (cidadãos, parlamento e governo),\n\nconfrontando-o com o sistema convencional. Através de um inquérito aos peticionários,\n\nmostramos que a introdução das petições-E incrementou os objetivos prosseguidos pelo\n\ndireito de petição, trazendo mais pessoas, mais jovens e menos habituadas a uma\n\nparticipação política ativa, promovendo uma resposta mais eficaz do parlamento e do\n\ngoverno. Também mostramos a relevância da avaliação deste processo pelos\n\npeticionários, tanto para a forma como avaliam o resultado deste exercício como para a\n\nconfiança nas instituições políticas.\n\nPalavras-chave: Parlamentos, envolvimento dos cidadãos, direito de petição, petições\n\neletrónicas (petições-E), participação\n\nAbstract Most parliaments in the EU provide for the right of petition, an instrument almost as old\n\nas parliaments. Since the dawn of the millennium, however, it has been the subject of\n\ninstitutional reforms aimed at boosting the involvement of citizens through the so-called\n\nelectronic petitions (E-petitions). This study provides a framework for assessing the\n\neffectiveness of parliamentary petition systems, and the analysis carried out at EU level\n\nhas shown the importance of institutional tools linked to E-petitions. In particular, we turn\n\nto the Portuguese case to assess the impact of E-petitions, namely on the behavior of the\n\nmain actors of this right, in comparison with the conventional system. Through a survey\n\nto the petitioners, we have shown that E petitions meet more and more the goals of this\n\nright by bringing more people, younger and less used to active political participation,\n\npromoting a more effective response from parliament and government. We also show the\n\nrelevance of the evaluation of the petition process by the petitioners, both for the way\n\nthey assess the outcomes of this exercise and for trust in political institutions.\n\nKeywords: Parliaments, citizens engagement, right of petition, e-petitions (E-petitions),\n\nparticipation\n\nAgradecimentos\n\nÀ Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, pelo financiamento deste estudo (Bolsa de\n\nDoutoramento - referência SFRH / BD / 77697 / 2011).\n\nÀ Assembleia da República, na pessoa da ex-Presidente Assunção Esteves, assim como\n\nà Dr.ª Cláudia Ribeiro e ao Dr. João Amaral - responsáveis, respetivamente, à data, pela\n\nDireção de Serviços de Apoio Técnico e Secretariado (DSATS) e Divisão de Apoio às\n\nComissões (DAC) da Assembleia da República -, a quem devo um profundo\n\nagradecimento, pelo apoio imprescindível que, desde a primeira hora, foi dado à\n\npreparação e concretização do inquérito realizado aos peticionários. Este agradecimento\n\né ainda extensível à Teresa Diogo e, muito especialmente, ao João Silva, que, com o seu\n\nzelo e generosidade, foi inexcedível na ajuda ao envio dos inquéritos aos peticionários,\n\nmostrando-me, por diversas vezes, a diferença que faz para o sistema de petições ter\n\npessoas assim empenhadas no seu sucesso.\n\nA todos os peticionários que tiveram a paciência e a generosidade de responder ao\n\ninquérito. Sem eles, nada disto teria sido possível. Também aos peritos que consultei, que,\n\ncom a sua pronta disponibilidade, me ajudaram a uma melhor compreensão do\n\nfuncionamento dos sistemas de petições, nomeadamente da Escócia (Anne Peat), da\n\nAlemanha (Thomas Saalfeld) e do Parlamento Europeu (David Lowe).\n\nTambém devo uma palavra de agradecimento ao Centro de Investigação e Estudos de\n\nSociologia – Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (CIES-IUL), por me ter acolhido na\n\ninstituição e dado condições que ajudaram muito o meu trabalho.\n\nAo meu orientador, o Professor Doutor André Freire, por ter aceitado o encargo desta\n\norientação, pelo incentivo e insistência, exigência e disponibilidade. Por me ter dado\n\nsempre uma oportunidade, nomeadamente de participar em projetos de investigação que\n\nme ajudaram a melhorar o meu trabalho. O seu empenho para que terminasse a tese foi\n\nfundamental.\n\nTambém não posso deixar de agradecer o muito que recebi da Professora Cristina Leston Bandeira. Pela inspiração e pelo apoio sempre disponível que, desde o início desta\n\nviagem, sempre manifestou. À Professora Cristina Leston-Bandeira devo ainda, e talvez\n\nsobretudo, uma forma de olhar para o papel do Parlamento moderno, nomeadamente na\n\nsua relação com os cidadãos. Este trabalho é, pois, tributário dessa influência, que, espero,\n\nse reflita a cada passo desta tese.\n\nVárias outras pessoas foram fundamentais para que conseguisse chegar aqui. A quem,\n\ntendo procurado ajuda, recebi sempre o melhor que tinham. Foi o caso do Professor\n\nDoutor Rui Brites, que, numa primeira fase da análise estatística, prestou um generoso\n\napoio. Também do Professor Doutor Pedro Rosa, e da mestre Augusta Correia, que\n\nresponderam com empenho e, por vezes, sacrifício, aos meus insistentes pedidos de\n\nauxílio estatístico.\n\nAo meu pai, pela paciente revisão e sugestões.\n\nFinalmente, à Ana Oliveira, a quem devo o incentivo para escrever cada vírgula, cada\n\nponto, cada caractere deste trabalho. E muito, muito mais.\n\nAos meus filhos, pela imensa paciência que tiveram, assim como à minha família, que há\n\ntrês meses me ouvem dizer que “já só falta uma semana”, como se o ouvissem pela\n\nprimeira vez.\n\nDe todos os que citei, recebi sempre muito. A todos, a minha gratidão.\n\ni\n\nÍndice\n\nÍndice i\n\nQuadros e figuras iv\n\nLista de siglas e acrónimos viii\n\n1. Introdução 1\n\n1.1.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n1\n\n1. Introdução\n\nNo início de 2012, uma notícia do jornal Público1 titulava: \"Petição sobre salários e\n\nprémios de gestores públicos sem consequências no Parlamento\".\n\nContudo, a petição deu entrada no Parlamento, que a disponibiliza no seu site. Esta foi\n\ndistribuída a um deputado. O Parlamento solicitou ao Governo uma posição sobre a matéria.\n\nO Governo respondeu. Os peticionários foram ouvidos pela comissão parlamentar competente\n\nna matéria, a Comissão de Orçamento, Finanças e Administração Pública. O deputado relator\n\nelaborou um relatório, onde se ponderam os vários contributos sobre a pretensão dos\n\npeticionários (antes já havia sido aprovado um relatório intercalar). O relatório foi\n\napresentado, discutido e votado pela Comissão parlamentar competente. A petição foi\n\ndebatida em reunião plenária, momento nobre dos trabalhos parlamentares. A maioria destes\n\nmomentos estão disponíveis (em formatos vários – escrito, vídeo, audio) no site2 do\n\nparlamento, para quem estiver interessado. A petição foi objeto de cobertura noticiosa como a\n\nque nos diz que a petição não teve quaisquer consequências. Ou seja, a petição teve, como\n\nvimos, consequências, mas não aquelas que intuitivamente normalmente se associam a este\n\ninstrumento de participação política: o acolhimento da pretensão da petição.\n\nCom efeito, o Parlamento foi chamado a debater uma matéria determinada\n\nexclusivamente pelos peticionários. Exerceu a sua função fiscalizadora. Obrigou o Governo a\n\njustificar-se e a trazer informação para o processo. Esta informação foi disponibilizada a todos\n\nos cidadãos no site, aumentando a transparência da atividade política e permitindo a\n\nrealização de uma série de objetivos prosseguidos por este direito.\n\nEste é, precisamente, um dos principais objetivos deste trabalho: propor um quadro de\n\navaliação do direito de petição, que permita avaliar estes sistemas de acordo com o que\n\npodem e devem oferecer (tendo em conta os objetivos que prosseguem) e não em função de\n\ncritérios que não servem este direito. Isto permitirá responder à pergunta de partida desta tese:\n\nem que medida os diferentes sistemas de petições têm contribuído para a realização dos seus\n\nobjetivos?\n\n1http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/peticao-sobre-salarios-e-premios-de-gestores-publicos-semconsequencias-no-parlamento-1530712 2 http://www.parlamento.pt/ActividadeParlamentar/Paginas/DetalhePeticao.aspx?BID=12017\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n2\n\n*\n\nO modo como muitas democracias contemporâneas funcionam tem estado a ser posto\n\nem causa pelos cidadãos, que revelam uma crescente abstenção nos atos eleitorais e\n\ninsatisfação com o desempenho das instituições democráticas (Putnam, Pharr e Dalton 2000;\n\nNorris 2002; Teixeira e Freire 2009).\n\nA crise política, económica e financeira que afeta alguns países europeus desde o final\n\nda década passada só parece estar a agravar esta situação, suscitando, da parte de alguns\n\nautores, a dúvida sobre se as instituições representativas conseguirão manter as ligações com\n\nos cidadãos (Mair 2009).\n\nIndependentemente de as instituições políticas serem ou não responsáveis e\n\nresponsabilizáveis pela crise económica, esta veio mostrar, com particular acuidade, que os\n\nestados atuais já não estão a conseguir oferecer aos cidadãos o desenvolvimento económico e\n\nsocial que estes esperam (Wessels 2011).\n\nClaro que os fatores que explicam o afastamento dos cidadãos relativamente ao\n\nparlamento encontram-se a montante da crise. Uns são endógenos, outros exógenos, estando\n\nmuitas vezes o declínio da confiança no parlamento mais dependente de variáveis externas do\n\nque do desempenho do próprio parlamento (Leston-Bandeira 2012a).\n\nCom vista a tentar contrariar este afastamento, as instituições parlamentares não têm\n\nficado paradas. Um pouco por todo o mundo, os parlamentos têm multiplicado iniciativas\n\ncom vista a tornar esta instituição mais inclusiva, pública, transparente e accountable. \"Things\n\nare happening\", reconhecem Alonso, Keane e Merkel (2011).\n\nNa sua versão mais simples, os parlamentos limitam-se a disponibilizar uma\n\nquantidade significativa de informação sobre a sua atividade, algo que era inédito até há\n\nmenos de duas décadas. No entanto, a mera difusão de informação pode ter um impacto\n\nsignificativo na imagem de uma instituição como o parlamento, que carece de uma identidade\n\nforte, o que pode também ajudar a explicar porque tem uma imagem tão negativa junto dos\n\ncidadãos (Kelso 2007; Leston-Bandeira 2014), deixando-se contaminar pela impopularidade\n\ndos partidos políticos, aos quais se associam questões negativas como a do financiamento\n\npartidário ou a promiscuidade de interesses na política (Beetham 2011). Uma identidade\n\nprópria mais forte pode ajudar a descolar desta imagem.\n\nNa sua versão mais elaborada, os parlamentos tentam aproximar-se dos cidadãos\n\ncriando-lhes oportunidades de participação, de apresentarem diretamente aos representantes\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n3\n\nas suas demandas, de alguma forma voltando (ou revitalizando) a uma função que está na sua\n\norigem: de ser intermediário entre cidadãos e poder executivo (Dalton, Scarrow e Cain 2004;\n\nDalton 2004 ; Leston-Bandeira e Tibúrcio 2015).\n\nÉ nesta última via que se enquadra a recente revitalização do velhinho direito de\n\npetição parlamentar (provavelmente, o direito político mais antigo, segundo Jorge Miranda\n\n1995) em vários parlamentos europeus, e à qual não foi alheia também a associação às novas\n\ntecnologias, apresentada como forma de revigorar a democracia representativa e potenciar as\n\npossibilidades de participação dos cidadãos.\n\nO parlamento escocês foi pioneiro na Europa a renovar este instrumento de\n\nparticipação (1999). Em 2005, foi a vez do parlamento português e do parlamento alemão.\n\nMais recentemente, podemos encontrar exemplos desse interesse na Irlanda (2012), no\n\nLuxemburgo (2014) e no Reino Unido (2015). Há também experiências a nível local (vários\n\nmunicípios da Noruega) e, a nível supranacional, o Parlamento Europeu, que tem um sistema\n\nde petições consolidado e que, em novembro de 2014, consagrou as petições eletrónicas\n\n(Tibúrcio 2015b).\n\nEste ímpeto reformador trouxe uma nova visibilidade a este decano direito, que\n\ncontribuiu para que, mesmo num cenário de severa crise económica propício à\n\ndesmobilização da participação mais institucional, este direito visse a sua procura manter-se\n\nou mesmo aumentar (como aconteceu em Portugal, no Parlamento Europeu ou no Reino\n\nUnido), colocando uma pressão acrescida na resposta a dar por parte dos parlamentos (e dos\n\nGovernos por esta via demandados).\n\nNo entanto, é ainda escassa a informação acerca da eficácia deste direito,\n\nnomeadamente depois das transformações mais recentes.\n\nApesar de estas reformas criarem oportunidades, importa realçar, na linha de Dalton,\n\nScarrow e Cain (2004), que estas também podem colocar desafios significativos para a\n\ndemocracia. É, pois, importante conhecer em que medida é que o eventual progresso feito\n\nnalgumas dimensões não é feito à custa do progresso de outras. Este é, assim, o segundo\n\ngrande objetivo desta investigação, que passa pela análise dos efeitos das recentes reformas de\n\nque foi objeto este direito, nomeadamente através das novas tecnologias (a chamada\n\nmodernização do direito de petição).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n4\n\nAssim, através deste trabalho pretendemos contribuir com um inovador quadro de\n\navaliação do direito de petição, que permitirá avaliar estes sistemas de acordo com o que\n\npodem e devem oferecer (tendo em conta os objetivos que prosseguem) e não em função de\n\ncritérios que não servem este direito, como o da satisfação do pedido do peticionário. Com\n\nbase neste quadro, fazemos uma análise sistemática dos sistemas de petição de vários\n\nparlamentos da União Europeia (mais Escócia e Parlamento Europeu), aferindo os efeitos das\n\nrecentes reformas de que foi objeto, nomeadamente através das novas tecnologias. Deste\n\nmodo, identificamos quais as condicionantes – institucionais e de comportamento dos seus\n\nprincipais atores – do direito de petição destes parlamentos, e analisamos como é que aquelas\n\nafetam os objetivos prosseguidos por este direito.\n\nFinalmente, debruçamo-nos em particular sobre o caso português, por constituir, pela\n\nforma como se modernizou, um caso privilegiado para o estudo do impacto das petições-E.\n\nNesta parte, teremos oportunidade de, com base numa bateria de dados empíricos sobre o\n\ncomportamento dos atores do sistema de petições durante o período entre 1999 e 2012,\n\nnomeadamente através de um inquérito aos peticionários portugueses (inédito na sua\n\nabrangência), traçar, pela primeira vez, o perfil dos peticionários portugueses3. Desta forma,\n\npoderemos conhecer se as reformas de que este direito foi objeto lograram um dos seus\n\nobjetivos primordiais: chamar novos públicos – habitualmente menos participativos - para o\n\nexercício da participação política. Por último, analisamos os dados sobre a avaliação do\n\nsistema de petições pelos peticionários, mostrando se a avaliação do processo é um preditor\n\nda avaliação do resultado, assim como da confiança na Assembleia da República. Esta análise\n\nserá contextualizada com as reformas do sistema de petições da Escócia e da Alemanha, os\n\ndois sistemas que empreenderam uma modernização comparável com o caso português, com\n\nexperiências consolidadas e temporalmente coincidentes.\n\n1.1. Avaliação da eficácia do sistema de petições parlamentares: enquadramento teórico e aspetos metodológicos (objetivos e operacionalização)\n\nA Ciência Política tem dedicado considerável atenção ao estudo da democracia e da\n\nparticipação política. Embora menos, também se tem debruçado crescentemente sobre o\n\nestudo de democracia e da participação eletrónica (v.g. Barber, anos 90 ou, mais\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n5\n\nrecentemente, Coleman e Blumler 2009). Contudo, poucos estudos contemplam uma\n\navaliação destas experiências. Quanto ao impacto da Internet na democracia e,\n\nespecificamente, sobre o Parlamento, refiram-se os trabalhos de Coleman (1999), Trechsel\n\n(2003) e Norris (2001), esta última em torno da questão de saber se a Internet alarga\n\npossibilidades de participação ou, contrariamente, acentua as desigualdades entre cidadãos\n\nativos e não ativos.\n\nAs petições proporcionam também um foco privilegiado para o estudo do impacto das\n\nnovas tecnologias na participação política. Com efeito, só recentemente é que se encontram\n\nformas de participação política eletrónica que passaram da fase experimental, nomeadamente\n\nas institucionais, sendo o sistema de petições eletrónica (petições-E) considerado como o mais\n\ndesenvolvido (Lindner, Aichholzer, Hennen 2016), com significativo nível de maturidade e\n\ninstitucionalização de procedimentos.\n\nNa última década e meia, começaram a surgir alguns estudos de avaliação e análise\n\nempírica do direito de petição parlamentar. O primeiro destes estudos, no dealbar da década\n\npassada, foi um estudo coordenado por Marilia Crespo Allen (2001) para o Parlamento\n\nEuropeu, comparando os diferentes enquadramentos legais dos sistemas de petições da União\n\nEuropeia. Apesar de ter sido um importante contributo para uma visão comparativa dos\n\nregimes legais do direito de petição nestes países, o momento em que foi realizado ditou que\n\nescapasse a este estudo o ímpeto modernizador deste direito que se viu nos anos\n\nimediatamente a seguir. Os trabalhos de Carman, na Escócia (2006), e Lindner e Riehm, na\n\nAlemanha (2011), foram, assim, os dois principais estudos sobre o direito de petição,\n\nabrangendo uma análise do impacto das funcionalidades eletrónicas. Começam também a\n\nsurgir estudos comparativos sobre a modernização do direito de petição, nomeadamente por\n\nestes últimos autores (Riehm, Böhle, e Lindner 2014), contendo as primeiras referências à\n\nmodernização do caso português, apesar de este contar desde 2005 com um sistema de\n\npetições enquadrável, sob qualquer dos critérios frequentemente adotados, como de petições E4.\n\nEm Portugal, existem alguns estudos sobre este direito de participação política,\n\nnomeadamente, os mais recentes, aflorando algumas dimensões do impacto das reformas de\n\nque foi objeto. Durante os anos noventa, alguns estudos do foro do direito constitucional\n\n3 Fernandes (2013) também fez um inquérito aos peticionários, embora limitado a duas sessões legislativas (2011-2013) e centrando-se apenas na avaliação do exercício deste direito (não incidindo, portanto, sobre o perfil dos peticionários). 4 Ver infra\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n6\n\nsobre este direito: Barbosa Rodrigues (1997) e Jorge Miranda (1994). Numa abordagem\n\npolitológica, encontramos referências em Braga da Cruz (1988), Leston-Bandeira (2002),\n\nFreire et al (2002). Mais recentemente, desde 2008, dois trabalhos, na área do Direito\n\nConstitucional, dedicados a este direito: Maria Luísa Duarte (2008) e Jorge Miranda (2008).\n\nNa área da Ciência Política: os nossos estudos (2010, 2012, 2015a, 2015b, 2016), e Fernandes\n\n(2013), no âmbito dos quais se analisam a forma como este direito tem sido usado pelos\n\npeticionários e tratado pelo Parlamento. Merece ainda referência o estudo de Martins e Sá\n\n(2005) sobre o direito de queixa ao Provedor de Justiça, direito gémeo do direito de petição,\n\nconstituindo porventura o primeiro estudo aprofundado na área da Ciência Política em\n\nPortugal sobre estas formas de participação convencional, caracterizando-o no âmbito das\n\nprincipais tipologias de participação política, que seguimos no capítulo 3 deste trabalho.\n\nSobre modelos de avaliação da participação, embora existam vários estudos relatados\n\nna literatura acerca de avaliações de participação pública nas políticas públicas em vários\n\ndomínios (na área do ambiente, transportes, biotecnologia, etc.), bem como, numa fase ainda\n\nmais embrionária, no âmbito da participação eletrónica (Chess e Purcell 1999, Rowe e Frewer\n\n2000; 2004, ou Macintosh e Whyte 2006; 2008), são poucos os estudos sobre avaliação\n\nestruturada (não subjetiva) da eficácia de formas de participação dos cidadãos (Rowe e\n\nFrewer 2004). Este é precisamente um dos escopos desta investigação: uma avaliação\n\nestruturada dos sistemas de petição como um todo, incluindo as formas convencionais e as\n\nmais recentes petições-E, cujo cabal impacto ainda está por determinar ao nível da ciência\n\npolítica, desenvolvendo-se, no final, o caso do sistema de petições perante a Assembleia da\n\nRepública, em Portugal.\n\n*\n\nPlano da tese\n\nAssim, começamos por fazer, na Parte I, um enquadramento teórico sobre o conceito\n\nde participação e a evolução do papel dos parlamentos, notando como estes últimos se têm\n\ndistinguido nas últimas duas décadas pela procura de um envolvimento mais ativo com os\n\ncidadãos. Depois de caracterizar o direito de petição, distinguimos os parlamentos da UE em\n\nfunção do sistema de petições previsto, incluindo também na nossa análise um exemplo de\n\nsistema de petições infra estadual (caso da Escócia) e outro supranacional (União Europeia).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n7\n\nAssim, identificámos três tipos de parlamento: i) os que não preveem um sistema de petições;\n\nii) os que preveem um sistema de petições convencional; iii) os que contemplam um sistema\n\nde petições modernizado, i.e., sistemas de petições que se reformaram na última década e\n\nmeia, nomeadamente através das chamadas petições eletrónicas.\n\nNa Parte II, propomos um modelo holístico de avaliação do direito de petição, que\n\nconsidera tanto aspetos legais e institucionais (quer convencionais quer os relativos às\n\npetições-E) como de comportamento dos atores relevantes deste direito, e que servirá de base\n\nà análise deste direito nos parlamentos da UE.\n\nNa Parte III, debruçamo-nos em particular sobre o caso português, por constituir um\n\ncaso privilegiado para o estudo do impacto das petições-E. Com efeito, a forma como o\n\nsistema de petições do parlamento português se modernizou distingue-o dos restantes\n\nexemplos de modernização consolidados, como o da Escócia e da Alemanha. Enquanto no\n\ncaso português o sistema se manteve no essencial inalterado, associando, porém, à\n\ngeneralidade das suas valências as funcionalidades eletrónicas, nomeadamente quanto à\n\npublicidade, o sistema de petições-E escocês foi instituído ab initio, não permitindo uma\n\ncomparação anterior, e o sistema de petições-E alemão, criado em 2005, instituiu-se\n\nparalelamente ao sistema de petições convencional, que se manteve em vigor praticamente\n\nnos mesmos moldes, isto é, sem que o anterior sistema tenha beneficiado globalmente das\n\nvalências eletrónicas. É verdade que, no sistema alemão, é possível submeter petições\n\n”convencionais” por E-mail, no entanto, isto não é suficiente para caracterizar o sistema de\n\npetições do Bundestag como um sistema de petições-E. Este existe, mas apenas aplicado ao\n\ncaso das “petições públicas”, que fazem pleno uso de várias funcionalidades eletrónicas,\n\nnomeadamente as que decorrem da publicidade por via da Internet. Assim, enquanto em\n\nPortugal havia um sistema de petições convencional que foi convertido, em 2005, num\n\nsistema de petições-E, na Alemanha o sistema de petições convencional continuou em vigor,\n\ntendo passado a coexistir, em paralelo, um sistema de petições-E. Desta forma, o caso\n\nportuguês permitirá avaliar em que medida o comportamento dos peticionários – e dos\n\nrestantes atores deste direito - se adaptou a esta modernização, contextualizando-a com os\n\nrestantes casos de modernização, nomeadamente com os dois grandes baluartes da\n\nmodernização do direito de petição, a Escócia e a Alemanha (quanto às “petições públicas”).\n\nImporta referir que o projeto que agora se submete a apreciação representa, de certo\n\nmodo, uma continuação da investigação iniciada no âmbito da nossa tese de mestrado (2008).\n\nAí analisámos em particular as petições apresentadas à Assembleia da República entre 1995 A eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n8\n\n2005 (entre a VII e a IX legislatura), tendo chegado a algumas pistas sobre a utilização efetiva\n\ndeste direito: predomínio das petições de interesse geral em relação às de interesse meramente\n\nprivado; não captura do direito de petição por entidades coletivas como os sindicatos;\n\naumento muito significativo do número de petições entradas desde 2005, registando-se um\n\npredomínio (até aí inexistente) das petições apresentadas por meros cidadãos, com apenas\n\numa assinatura.\n\nO que ficou de fora da investigação do mestrado e que agora constitui quatro dos eixos\n\nfundamentais desta investigação:\n\ni) A proposta de um quadro normativo que permita avaliar de forma abrangente a\n\neficácia do direito de petição parlamentar (na dimensão convencional e eletrónica);\n\nii) Uma perspetiva comparada e sistemática do direito de petição;\n\niii) Uma avaliação do impacto das petições-E no sistema de petições português,\n\nnomeadamente no perfil dos peticionários.\n\niv) Uma análise da avaliação dos peticionários e a sua influência no apoio dos cidadãos à\n\ninstituição parlamentar.\n\nObjetivos e aspetos metodológicos\n\nO presente estudo passa por uma análise multimétodo que tem como principal objetivo\n\nresponder às seguintes questões:\n\n1. Têm sido atingidos os objetivos prosseguidos pelo direito de petição?\n\n2. Que fatores (institucionais, comportamentais) promovem estes objetivos?\n\n3. As novas tecnologias vieram potenciar os objetivos do direito de petição, como\n\npretendido?\n\nQuanto ao caso português, avaliamos o impacto das petições-E no sistema de petições\n\nda AR, e procuramos conhecer os preditores da avaliação dos peticionários, nomeadamente\n\nquanto a saber:\n\n1. Afetaram o perfil e o comportamento dos peticionários?\n\n2. Afetaram a avaliação dos peticionários acerca do sistema de petições?\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n9\n\n3. Afetaram o comportamento dos restantes atores do direito de petição?\n\n4. Como é que a eficácia do sistema de petições da Assembleia da República se enquadra\n\nno contexto dos sistemas de petição comparados?\n\n5. Quais os preditores estatísticos da “avaliação dos peticionários”?\n\n6. Qual a influência da “avaliação do processo” e da “avaliação do resultado” na\n\nconfiança no parlamento (e noutras instituições políticas, como o Governo e a\n\nPresidência da República)?\n\nA Parte II desta investigação – em que se propõe um quadro de avaliação da eficácia\n\ndo direito de petição, cotejando para o efeito as principais características dos sistemas de\n\npetição dos parlamentos da UE (e Escócia e Parlamento Europeu) - assenta numa análise\n\nqualitativa, para a qual recorremos às principais fontes normativas que conformam legalmente\n\neste direito (constituições, leis e regulamentos sobre petições, regimentos parlamentares –\n\nidentificadas no Quadro 3.4), mas também documentos preparatórios e enquadradores do\n\nregime legal (exposições de motivos, debates, relatórios, etc.). Também foram consultados os\n\nsites e informação online disponível sobre o sistema (brochuras eletrónicas, vídeos, etc.).\n\nEm relação à Parte III, sobre o caso português, esta consiste numa análise\n\nessencialmente quantitativa, assente em grande medida no inquérito realizado aos\n\npeticionários à Assembleia da República entre 1999 e 2012 (do início da VIII legislatura até\n\nao final da 1.ª sessão da XII legislatura). Este inquérito (Anexo B) teve como principais\n\nobjetivos obter uma avaliação (até à data inédita pela sua abrangência temporal) dos\n\npeticionários sobre o sistema de petições da Assembleia da República, assim como uma\n\ncaracterização sociodemográfica - até hoje inexistente - dos peticionários. Pelo papel decisivo\n\n(ainda que invisível), nomeadamente como gate-keepers, que os funcionários parlamentares\n\npodem desempenhar (cfr. notado por Leston-Bandeira 2007), realizámos entrevistas (livres)\n\nàqueles que lidam de perto com este instrumento de participação. Com vista a uma análise\n\nabrangente do comportamento de todos os atores envolvidos neste direito (cidadãos,\n\nparlamento e Governo), recolhemos os dados de todas as petições deste período, recorrendo a\n\nfontes primárias (relatórios, contagem de prazos, análise ao teor das respostas, etc.),\n\nnomeadamente através do acesso ao site da Assembleia da República5, ao Arquivo Histórico\n\nda AR, bem como da base de dados da Intranet do Parlamento (Atividade Parlamentar - AP).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n10\n\nCom vista a realizar a análise pretendida, os dados do inquérito foram posteriormente\n\nagregados aos dados recolhidos sobre as petições do período em causa (petições submetidas\n\nentre 1999 e 2012), reunindo, assim, numa única base de dados informação sobre o\n\nprocedimento e sobre a avaliação deste processo e perfil dos peticionários.\n\nNum primeiro momento, e sempre que pertinente, a análise sobre o caso português foi\n\nconfrontada com os dados da população portuguesa recolhidos no “Inquérito aos Cidadãos\n\nPortugueses 2012” (Freire, Viegas e Lisi 2012), de forma a revelar-nos diferenças e\n\nsemelhanças dos peticionários do atual sistema em vigor6 em relação à generalidade dos\n\ncidadãos portugueses.\n\nSeguidamente, encetámos, sempre que possível, uma contextualização com os casos\n\nde modernização dos sistemas de petição da Escócia e da Alemanha, através da qual\n\nprocurámos identificar o que distingue e o que aproxima o caso português destas experiências.\n\nA escolha dos países resulta de serem os únicos parlamentos com experiências de petições-E\n\nconsolidadas e temporalmente coincidentes, havendo também já uma considerável quantidade\n\nde dados disponíveis. Quando se justificou, também estabelecemos a comparação com o\n\nrecém modernizado sistema luxemburguês, em relação ao qual, embora temporalmente\n\nrecente (de 2014), já existem alguns dados empíricos de interesse para o nosso estudo,\n\nnomeadamente ao nível do perfil dos peticionários (Kies 2016).\n\nPara o efeito, recorremos aos dados contidos nos estudos disponíveis sobre estes\n\nsistemas, nomeadamente quanto ao perfil dos peticionários e à avaliação que estes fazem do\n\nexercício deste direito. Para o caso escocês, destaca-se o estudo da Universidade de Glasgow\n\npara a Comissão de Petições do Parlamento da Escócia (Carman 2006), que conduziu em\n\n2006 um inquérito dirigido a todos os peticionários que submeteram petições desde a criação\n\ndeste direito, em 1999 (N=722, tendo obtido uma taxa de resposta de 52%). Os resultados do\n\ninquérito foram objeto de uma análise multi-método, da qual resultaram, pelo menos, três\n\npublicações: Carman (2006), Ipsos Mori e Carman (2009) e Carman (2010). No caso alemão,\n\nrealça-se o estudo realizado no âmbito do projeto de acompanhamento do sistema de petições\n\npelo Parlamento alemão \"Public electronic petitions and civic involvment\", compreendendo\n\ndois inquéritos: um primeiro, em março de 2007, enviado a todos os peticionários do sistema\n\nde “petições públicas” eletrónica, criado em 2005, i.e., 698 peticionários (com uma taxa de\n\nresposta de 50% - 350); um segundo, enviado a uma amostra aleatória de 710 peticionários\n\n5 http://www.parlamento.pt/Paginas/default.aspx 6 Ou seja, o sistema de petições-E, em vigor desde 2005.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n11\n\n(de um universo de 3211 que submeteram “petições públicas” entre 2008 e 2009), tendo a\n\ntaxa de resposta sido de 30% (201 respostas). Este projeto deu origem a várias publicações,\n\nentre as quais se destacam Lindner e Riehm (2011) e Riehm, Böhle e Lindner (2014), que\n\ncontemplam atualizações ao inquérito de 2007.\n\nOs elementos referentes ao sistema escocês e alemão foram complementados com\n\ninformação recolhida através da realização de questionários a especialistas nos sistemas de\n\npetições em causa.\n\nPor último, apresentamos, a partir do inquérito aos peticionários, um modelo\n\nestatístico multivariado com vista a determinar os preditores estatísticos da “avaliação dos\n\npeticionários”. A nossa expectativa é que, na linha da investigação conduzida por Carman\n\nsobre o sistema de petições escocês (Carman 2006), a avaliação do processo determine, em\n\ngrande medida, a avaliação que os peticionários fazem dos resultados deste direito. Para o\n\nefeito, realizou-se uma regressão linear múltipla através do método de Stepwise. A\n\njustificação para a utilização deste método assentou na retenção de variáveis que têm\n\ncontributo para o modelo, excluindo as que não têm, diminuindo, assim, o ruído do mesmo\n\n(Maroco 2007).\n\nCom o objetivo de verificar a capacidade preditora da “avaliação do processo” e da\n\n“avaliação do resultado” na confiança no parlamento (e noutras instituições políticas, como o\n\nGoverno e a Presidência da República), realizou-se uma análise de regressão linear\n\nhierárquica em dois blocos, tendo como variável de controlo o “autoposicionamento\n\nideológico” no primeiro bloco. A hipótese que testámos foi se, tal como parece ter ocorrido na\n\nEscócia, a avaliação dos peticionários em relação ao sistema de petições influencia o nível de\n\napoio às instituições políticas e, em especial, ao parlamento.\n\nQuanto ao período objeto de análise, os dados recolhidos e a análise feita referem-se\n\nao período entre 1999 e 2012, ou seja, entre a VIII e a XII legislatura. Este período é\n\njustificado por abranger um período considerável anterior à modernização deste instituto\n\n(1999-2005), permitindo estudar o seu impacto nos anos que se seguem (2005-2012).\n\nO inquérito aos peticionários, em particular\n\nO inquérito foi enviado a todos os primeiros peticionários que submeteram petições\n\nentre 1999 e 2012. A escolha dos primeiros peticionários deveu-se a um fator de ordem\n\nprática (apenas relativamente a estes poderia existir um contacto) mas, sobretudo, ao facto de\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n12\n\nserem estes os promotores da iniciativa da petição e, nessa qualidade, os únicos a quem a lei\n\nconfere direitos.\n\nTodas estas petições já se encontram encerradas (arquivadas, no algo equívoco jargão\n\nlegal), ou seja, já foram objeto de um relatório final, o que permite que relativamente a todas\n\nseja possível um juízo global sobre a experiência com o exercício deste direito.\n\nAssim, o universo do inquérito é composto pelos 1135 peticionários que apresentaram\n\npetições ao Parlamento nas VIII, IX, X, XI legislaturas e primeira sessão legislativa da XII\n\nlegislatura, ou seja, entre 1999 e 2012. Dado ser um universo finito e de reduzida dimensão,\n\noptou-se por enviar o inquérito a todos os 1135 peticionários.\n\nA preparação do inquérito revelou-se algo problemática, atendendo à inexistência de\n\numa base de dados com os contactos dos peticionários por parte da Assembleia da República\n\ne ao facto de muitos dos contactos existentes já estarem desatualizados, visto alguns destes\n\nremontarem há cerca de quinze anos. Isto exigiu, assim, um apoio extraordinário por parte da\n\nAssembleia da República para obter a informação em causa, sem o qual este inquérito nunca\n\npoderia ter sido realizado.\n\nNa elaboração do inquérito, optou-se por personalizar cada um deles, identificando-se\n\no número da petição e o respetivo assunto, de forma a permitir que os peticionários se\n\nlembrassem mais facilmente da petição e da experiência sobre a qual se solicitava opinião.\n\nSendo o inquérito sobre a experiência com uma determinada petição, há peticionários\n\nque, tendo submetido mais do que uma petição à AR, receberiam mais do que um\n\nquestionário para preencher. Para evitar esta situação, criámos um inquérito para estes casos,\n\nem que agregámos as várias petições submetidas pelo mesmo peticionário. Deste modo, cada\n\npeticionário “repetente” recebeu apenas um inquérito7.\n\nNum primeiro momento, privilegiou-se o envio do inquérito por E-mail, usando os\n\ncontactos eletrónicos deixados pelos peticionários no processo e, relativamente aos restantes,\n\nprocurando obter-se esse contacto de E-mail através de um contacto telefónico, processo que\n\nse mostrou relativamente moroso. Muitos destes contactos revelaram-se, sem surpresa,\n\ninfrutíferos (provavelmente devido à distância temporal relativamente ao momento em que\n\nesses dados foram fornecidos). Assim, dos inquéritos enviados por E-mail, apenas aqueles\n\n7 Na realidade, esta opção foi tomada já depois do início do envio dos inquéritos, pelo que houve alguns poucos repetentes que não chegaram a receber este inquérito de forma agregada.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n13\n\nque foram devolvidos por não terem chegado ao destinatário foram posteriormente enviados\n\npor via postal.\n\nForam enviados 634 inquéritos por E-mail e 501 inquéritos por carta. Estes continham\n\num envelope de porte pago (RSF) com endereço (da Assembleia da República) pré preenchido, permitindo a resposta gratuita e, dentro do possível, com menor constrangimento\n\npossível. Os inquéritos enviados por E-mail continham um link para o inquérito (elaborado no\n\n“Google Docs”8).\n\nSensivelmente um mês após terem sido enviados os primeiros inquéritos, foi feita uma\n\nnova insistência, tanto para os inquéritos postal como para os enviados por E-mail. Ao todo,\n\nforam feitas duas insistências em relação a cada peticionário (excepto, naturalmente, em\n\nrelação aos que já tinham respondido).\n\nOs inquéritos enviados por E-mail foram enviados pela primeira vez em meados de\n\ndezembro de 2013, tendo sido reenviados para os não respondentes por mais duas vezes (ao\n\nlongo dos meses seguintes - de janeiro a julho de 2014). Os inquéritos postais começaram a\n\nser enviados em junho de 2014 e reenviados para os não respondentes em setembro e outubro\n\ndo mesmo ano. O decurso do período em causa foi necessário não apenas devido às\n\ninsistências mas também à circunstância já referida de ter de se obter os elementos\n\nnecessários ao envio postal e eletrónico9.\n\nDeste modo, no total, houve 42 inquéritos enviados por correio eletrónico que foram\n\ndevolvidos e em relação aos quais não se conseguiu também obter endereço postal (apesar de\n\ndever ser assinalado o esforço notável que a Assembleia da República ainda fez no sentido de\n\ntentar atualizar os dados dos peticionários – nomeadamente através de centenas de contactos\n\ntelefónicos -, o que conseguiu fazer com sucesso nalguns casos). E houve 51 por via postal.\n\nOu seja, pelo menos 93 inquéritos que sabemos que nunca chegaram aos destinatários.\n\nContudo, presumimos que, relativamente aos inquéritos enviados por E-mail, tenha havido\n\ncertamente muitos que, apesar de não terem sido expressamente \"devolvidos\", nunca tenham\n\nchegado efetivamente aos destinatários, atendendo a tratarem-se de contactos antigos e com\n\n8 A título de exemplo, um dos inquéritos pode ser consultado em: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc3jVmYYTEiIgOctx5n43CMsq5MVN0KT5buw0CMqohVwiYyv g/viewform?fbzx=-5610549648758253087 9 Este procedimento teve de ser feito pela Assembleia da República - e, portanto, na medida dos constrangimentos de tempo deste órgão -, por exigências decorrentes da proteção de dados pessoais dos peticionários.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n14\n\nprobabilidade de já estarem desatualizados. No total, foram recebidas 302 respostas (143 via\n\nE-mail e 159 via postal).\n\nA taxa de respostas úteis (respostas completas ou quase completas) em relação ao total\n\nde peticionários foi de 27%, uma taxa de resposta baixa. Todavia, se considerarmos que uma\n\ngrande parte da análise que abaixo se faz incide unicamente sobre os peticionários cidadãos\n\n(idade, sexo, instrução, participação política e associativa, ideologia e identidade partidária,\n\nhábitos de participação política, etc.) e não sobre as entidades coletivas, a taxa de resposta a\n\nconsiderar passa a ser de 30% (universo de 762 peticionários singulares – cidadãos – entre\n\n1999 e 2012 e 225 respondentes singulares).\n\nOs fatores que, a nosso ver, explicam esta baixa taxa de resposta são, por um lado, o\n\nfacto já referido de se estar a lidar com uma base de dados incompleta, e, por outro, uma parte\n\ndestas moradas reportarem-se a uma realidade por vezes anterior em 15 anos ao momento do\n\ninquérito. Esta circunstância torna rapidamente desatualizado um contacto de E-mail e,\n\nfrequentemente, de endereço postal, também. Ao encontro desta hipótese, note-se, por\n\nexemplo, a taxa de resposta dos peticionários mais recentes (da XII legislatura - 2011-2012),\n\nque chega aos 40%.\n\nTambém deve ser referido, por exemplo, o facto de haver, na X legislatura, cerca de\n\ncem petições de massa10 apresentadas por peticionários diferentes mas cujo contacto indicado\n\né, na quase totalidade, da mesma pessoa (referimo-nos em particular às 105 petições que\n\nsolicitaram “a intervenção do Senhor Presidente da Assembleia da República para que a\n\ncarreira de vigilante seja reconhecida como Carreira Profissional de Agente de Segurança\n\nPrivada Aeroportuária”). Apesar das tentativas de obter junto deste os contactos dos restantes\n\npeticionários, estas tentativas revelaram-se infrutíferas, comprometendo a possibilidade de\n\nfazer chegar o inquérito aos peticionários destas petições.\n\nPor último, não é de descartar a possibilidade de a recetividade do inquérito também\n\nter sido afetada pelo momento em que este foi realizado, no auge da crise económica e\n\nfinanceira, com repercussões na confiança nas instituições políticas, nomeadamente no\n\nparlamento (cfr. Pequito, Tsatsanis e Belchior 2015). A confirmar-se, esta suspeita\n\nencontraria também suporte num dos contactos telefónicos realizados, em que o peticionário\n\n10 O Regulamento da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento alemão distingue “as petições múltiplas”, que são várias petições com o mesmo objecto, de “petições de massa”, constituídas por um grande n.º de petições com o mesmo assunto e cujo texto é totalmente, ou em grande medida, idêntico (ponto 2.2).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n15\n\ninformou que não responderia ao inquérito por o Parlamento não lhe merecer confiança e não\n\npretender colaborar com a instituição.\n\nEm relação às respostas obtidas, importa notar a impossibilidade de rejeitarmos um efeito\n\nde auto-escolha dos respondentes ao inquérito, o que nos impede de dizer que os inquiridos\n\nrepresentam a totalidade dos peticionários. Esta questão é particularmente relevante neste\n\ninquérito, devido ao facto de os inquiridos não terem sido selecionados aleatoriamente entre os\n\npeticionários daquele período temporal, mas resultarem daqueles que, tendo submetido uma\n\npetição ao Parlamento, aceitaram realizar o preenchimento do mesmo (ou seja, trata-se de uma\n\namostra de conveniência). Recorremos, assim, a alguns critérios de distribuição da totalidade de\n\npeticionários conhecidos para saber em que medida podemos dizer que os respondentes os\n\nrepresentam.\n\nAssim, recorremos à distribuição dos peticionários pelo género, pelo tipo de sistema em\n\nvigor (convencional ou petições-E) e pela natureza do titular.\n\nQuadro 1.1.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n17\n\nPARTE I\n\n2. Participação política e a evolução dos parlamentos\n\n2.1. A participação política\n\nSão múltiplas as propostas que, a partir dos anos 60, procuram enquadrar o conceito\n\nde participação política. Até então, dominava a teoria elitista, tributária de Schumpeter\n\n(1976), que reconduzia a participação ao processo eleitoral. Constitui a este respeito\n\nreferência o trabalho de Milbrath (1965) e, na mesma década, de Almond e Verba, este último\n\nalargando o conceito de participação política a outras formas de participação dos cidadãos,\n\ndestinadas a influenciar a decisão dos governantes (1963).\n\nNo entanto, o estudo sobre o envolvimento dos cidadãos com a política encontrava-se\n\nfocado na participação eleitoral, percebida como a forma primordial para os cidadãos se\n\nfazerem ouvir junto do sistema político.\n\nNa década de 70, este conceito alarga-se de molde a incluir novas formas de\n\nparticipação (como os protestos), destinadas a influenciar a decisão dos governantes (Verba e\n\nNie, 72).\n\nUmas das críticas apontadas a muitas destas definições consiste no facto de se\n\ncingirem a referir a \"influência\" como único repertório político e, por outro lado, colocarem o\n\nGoverno como único destinatário da participação (Pasquino 2010; Teorell, Torcall e Montero\n\n2007).\n\nAs conceções teóricas de participação política foram, naturalmente, influenciadas\n\npelas conceções normativas de democracia e pela valorização que fazem da participação\n\npolítica.\n\nBarber (1984) preconizava um papel forte da democracia direta, considerada um\n\nmodelo alternativo à democracia representativa. Segundo este autor, democracia é\n\nautorregulação, isto é, os cidadãos governam-se a si mesmos. Isto não quer dizer que os\n\ncidadãos intervenham em todos os momentos. No entanto, significa que sejam chamados a\n\nparticipar em todas as questões relevantes. Com este fito, as instituições devem facilitar a\n\nparticipação dos cidadãos na definição das agendas, na deliberação, na legislação, bem como\n\nna sua execução.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n18\n\nOutros autores defenderam um papel complementar da participação política em\n\nrelação à democracia representativa. É o caso de Pateman (1970), que salientou a necessidade\n\nde uma sociedade participativa para o estabelecimento de uma forma de Governo\n\ndemocrático, ou de Lijphart (1997). Entre os autores que valorizam a participação dos\n\ncidadãos conta-se também Dahl (1971, 2000), que considera a autodeterminação dos cidadãos\n\numa das consequências desejáveis da democracia, bem como Dalton (1996) ou Putnam\n\n(2000).\n\nRealce ainda para o estudo de Barnes e Kaase (1979), que primeiro distinguiu entre\n\nparticipação convencional e não convencional, reconhecendo as atividades de protesto e\n\ncontestação como uma modalidade de participação política, distinção que viria a ser seguida\n\npor muitos autores, como Norris (2002).\n\nA participação convencional ou institucional inclui formas de participação mais\n\nformais e politizadas, como votar ou contactar um político, sendo enquadradas pelas elites e\n\ninstituições políticas existentes. Pelo contrário, a participação não convencional ou não\n\ninstitucional caracteriza-se pela sua informalidade e escassa regulamentação, ocorrendo fora\n\ndo quadro institucional, em confronto com a elite política ou, pelo menos, fora do controlo\n\ndesta.\n\nOutra das obras com notável impacto foi a proposta de Inglehart (1997), que avançou\n\ncom uma distinção entre valores materialistas e pós-materialistas. Segundo o autor, estes\n\núltimos estariam a crescer nas sociedades desenvolvidas, substituindo valores como a\n\nsegurança e a autoridade por valores pós-materialistas, como igualdade, direitos humanos, ou\n\nvalores ligados à proteção do ambiente. Sendo a participação política dos cidadãos nos\n\nprocessos políticos algo muito valorizado pelos pós materialistas, esperar-se-ia que esta\n\ncrescesse à medida que nas democracias cresciam os valores pós materialistas, sobretudo nas\n\nmodalidades ligadas aos novos movimentos sociais e a outras \"formas de desafiar as elites\n\natravés da participação política\" (Inglehart 1997).\n\nImporta ainda aludir ao estudo de Dalton, Scarrow e Cain (2004), em que analisam\n\ntrês modos de democracia: democracia representativa, democracia direta e advocacy\n\ndemocracy (forma de democracia semi-direta). A primeira, ligada à valorização do processo\n\neleitoral (ex: eleições); a segunda, a formas diretas de deliberação pelos cidadãos, como\n\nforma de complementar ou, mesmo, de se substituir à democracia representativa (ex:\n\nreferendo); finalmente, a terceira, que procura - direta ou indiretamente - expandir as\n\noportunidades de participação dos cidadãos nos processos de formação e decisão de políticas,\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n19\n\npermanecendo, contudo, a decisão última nas elites políticas (ex: participação em consultas\n\npúblicas). Segundos os autores, apesar de menos direta e nem sempre fácil de quantificar em\n\ntermos de mudanças institucionais, é inegável a expansão da advocacy democracy a partir dos\n\nanos 90 do século passado.\n\nNeste estudo, Dalton, Scarrow e Cain propõem uma grelha comparativa de avaliação\n\nentre estas três formas de democracia, cotejando-as à luz dos critérios democráticos de Robert\n\nDahl12. Estes autores defendem que estas três formas não têm o mesmo impacto na\n\ndemocracia, nomeadamente na relação entre os cidadãos e o Estado. Assim, concluem que a\n\n\"advocacy democacy\" aumenta o potencial de influência no \"controlo da agenda\" e a\n\n\"participação efetiva\", para o que contribui o acesso não mediado ao processo de tomada de\n\ndecisões. Contudo, pode exacerbar a \"desigualdade política\" se a sua utilização for iníqua,\n\ndeixando para trás os cidadãos com menos recursos. Pelo contrário, a democracia\n\nrepresentativa satisfaz melhor o critério da \"igualdade política\", desde que assegure um\n\nnúmero considerável de participação, o mesmo se aplicando à democracia direta.\n\nQuanto a tipos e modalidades de participação, são inúmeras as propostas que podemos\n\nencontrar na literatura. No estudo que realizou acerca da participação política e democracia no\n\nPortugal do pós-1976, Martins (2004) detalha grande parte delas, salientando que as diversas\n\ntipologias variam de acordo com as posições dos seus autores acerca da democracia e da\n\nparticipação política, assim como em função da análise empírica sobre o modo como os\n\ncidadãos intervêm na vida pública (Martins 2004). No entanto, sublinha existir, apesar de\n\ntudo, um reconhecimento sobre a existência de diferenças significativas “no uso das formas\n\nde indivíduo para indivíduo e de consequências diferentes quanto à sua influência no processo\n\nde decisão política”.\n\nNesta obra, Meirinho Martins apresenta as principais tipologias, que divide entre as\n\ntributárias da perspetiva unidimensional das formas de participação política (cfr. Lane,\n\nMilbrath e Birch), as formas de participação na perspetiva multidimensional (cfr. Milbrath,\n\nVerba, Schewerin, Almond, Huntington, Parry) e as que opõem formas de participação\n\nconvencional e não convencional (cfr. Parry, Sani, Inglehart, Kaase e March).\n\nNo capítulo 3, tomamos parte destas tipologias e dimensões de análise como\n\nreferência para proceder à caracterização do direito de petição. Pela sua importância para este\n\n12 Conforme desenvolvemos mais à frente, os cinco critérios de Dahl (2000) para uma democracia ideal, uma das mais consagradas teorias da democracia, são: i) participação efetiva; ii) Igualdade política; iii) Informação Esclarecida; iv) Controlo da Agenda; v) Inclusão/Integração.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n20\n\ntrabalho, deter-nos-emos antes, porém, na distinção entre forma de participação convencional\n\ne não convencional, em relação às quais não existe, porém, um consenso sobre o que deva\n\ncaber em cada uma destas formas. Uma parte deste dissenso decorre, como assinala Parry\n\n(1992), da ausência de um entendimento comum sobre “os comportamentos que são aceites\n\ncomo toleráveis ou como intoleráveis para o funcionamento da democracia” (Martins 2004),\n\nentendimento que varia, naturalmente, de lugar para lugar. Ora, deste critério decorre que\n\nqualquer forma de participação que esteja prevista num determinado ordenamento jurídico (e,\n\npor maioria de razão, quando seja incentivado por esse ordenamento), é enquadrada como\n\numa forma convencional de participação.\n\nO cariz contestatário ou não da ação política é também apresentado como critério. De\n\num lado, estariam formas associadas ao crescimento de movimentos de protesto social que\n\nprotagonizam formas de ação direta, contestatária e autónoma (como manifestações, bloqueio\n\nde vias de comunicação, ocupação de edifícios públicos) e, de outro lado, formas tradicionais\n\ninstitucionalizadas. Outros autores, como Gabriel (1981), sugerem ainda um critério baseado\n\nno caráter ocasional e esporádico das iniciativas, com vista à resolução de problemas\n\nespecíficos (forma não convencional) e a intervenção institucionalizada de natureza\n\npermanente e exercida com base na tradição (forma convencional).\n\nAdotando ou não a designação de formas de participação convencional, a associação\n\nentre formas de participação não convencional e de protesto é generalizada. Com efeito,\n\npodemos encontrá-la em autores como Sani (1989), que sugere o critério da visibilidade social\n\nda iniciativa, propondo a designação de “velhas” e “novas” forma de participação, não sendo\n\nestas propriamente novas mas apenas formas de ação que se tornaram, entretanto, mais\n\nfrequentes. Pare este autor, estas formas caracterizam-se, em geral, e entre outras\n\ncaracterísticas, por alguma violência, parco controlo pelos autores das iniciativas, e pela\n\nforma de “ação direta” na resolução dos problemas, não delegando em terceiros (exemplo:\n\nocupação de fábricas, recusa de pagamentos).\n\nComo veremos, o direito de submeter petições ao Parlamento enquadra-se, de acordo\n\ncom a generalidade dos critérios usados pela literatura, como uma forma de participação\n\nconvencional ou, na designação preferida por Sani, como uma velha forma de participação.\n\nAtendendo ao foco no caso português na Parte III deste estudo, vale a pena aflorar a\n\nsituação de Portugal no que à participação institucional de cariz político diz respeito,\n\ncontextualizando-a no quadro europeu. O que se verifica é que o nível médio de participação\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n21\n\nem Portugal ao longo da última década (2002-2012), que é de 5%, se situa muito abaixo do\n\nnível médio registado no conjunto dos países da Europa Ocidental presentes, que é de 13%,\n\nficando ainda mais distante da média registada nos países do Norte da Europa, que no seu\n\nconjunto revelam o maior nível médio de participação institucional de cariz político na\n\nprimeira década do século XXI (20%) (Viegas, Belchior e Seiceira 2010).\n\nEstas democracias do Norte da Europa, mais ativas, partilham, segundo aqueles\n\nautores, algumas características comuns, entre elas uma forte tradição protestante, uma\n\nmodernização precoce, uma forte tradição democrática (que passa também por serem\n\ndemocracias mais longevas), longos períodos de estabilidade social, e de políticas\n\neconómicas. Pelo contrário, as democracias europeias mais recentes como a portuguesa\n\ndistinguem-se por se terem democratizado após períodos consideráveis de Governo autoritário\n\ne não democrático, caracterizando-se por serem democracias passivas no que à participação\n\npolítica institucional diz respeito.\n\nO mesmo se passa relativamente ao nível de participação política não convencional,\n\nque inclui aqui as novas formas de participação (boicotar certos produtos), mas também a\n\nparticipação de protesto (assinar uma petição ou assinar um abaixo-assinado e participar em\n\nmanifestações públicas legais). Em Portugal, para o mesmo período, a média é de apenas 4%,\n\nmuito abaixo do nível médio observado quer em Espanha (que é de 19%), quer nos países\n\nmais a Norte, como a Alemanha (22%), a Dinamarca (21%) ou a França (25%) (Viegas,\n\nTeixeira e Amador 2015). De acordo com os mesmos autores, o caso dos baixos níveis de\n\nparticipação de Portugal (convencional e não convencional) pode ser explicado pela\n\nexperiência do regime autoritário durante quase metade do século XX (1926-1974),\n\ncontribuindo com as suas características (antiparlamentarismo, anti-partidarismo, contrário a\n\ntodas as liberdades políticas, sociais civis - e, como tal, repressivo de toda a participação) para\n\numa cultura de passividade e de indiferença política entre os portugueses, a qual, tal como\n\nsucede na generalidade das democracias, precisa de tempo para ser ultrapassada.\n\n2.2.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n22\n\nSamuel Huntington (1968) considerava que a institucionalização política é a causa\n\nprimordial do desenvolvimento dos países. Para Huntington, as instituições são sobretudo\n\npadrões de ação democráticos: “Institutions are stable, valued, recurring patterns of\n\nbehavior”, sendo a institucionalização o processo pelo qual as organizações e procedimentos\n\nadquirem valor e estabilidade” (Huntington 1968).\n\nNo que diz respeito à institucionalização dos parlamentos, é incontornável o\n\ncontributo de Nelson Polsby (1968), através do seu estudo sobre o Congresso norte americano, onde aplicou a teoria de Huntington a esta instituição específica. São conhecidas\n\nas três características que, segundo este autor, definem uma organização institucionalizada: a\n\nautonomia, a complexidade interna e a adoção de critérios universalistas, e não particularistas.\n\nEm relação à primeira característica (autonomia), Polsby defende que ela se reflete\n\nnuma organização bem delimitada, que se distingue do ambiente que a rodeia, sendo\n\nrelativamente difícil tornar-se um dos seus membros, embora estes sejam facilmente\n\nidentificáveis. A maioria dos seus líderes é recrutada no interior da organização. No que diz\n\nrespeito à segunda característica (complexidade), consiste numa organização cujas funções\n\nestão internamente separadas, assente numa base clara e regular. Finalmente, a organização\n\norienta-se sobretudo por critérios universais e não particularistas, privilegiando-se, na\n\ncondução dos assuntos internos, métodos automáticos e não discricionários. Existe respeito\n\npor regras e coerência com decisões anteriores e o sistema de mérito prevalece sobre o\n\nfavoritismo e o nepotismo (1968).\n\nMais tarde, em 1975, Polsby distinguiu dois tipos de parlamentos em função do seu\n\ngrau de independência em relação a interferências externas na atividade legislativa, a que\n\nchamou “arena legislatures” e “transformative legislatures”. Conforme sublinha Kreppel\n\n(2014), estas duas categorias não foram apresentadas como dicotómicas, mas antes como um\n\neixo ao longo do qual os parlamentos podiam ser colocados, com o Congresso dos Estados\n\nUnidos servindo de modelo para o tipo “transformative” e a Câmara dos Comuns britânica\n\ndesempenhando esse papel para o tipo de “arena” (Polsby 1975 130 -1).\n\nTambém Robert Packenman (1970) deu um contributo importante nesta área,\n\nnomeadamente no que concerne às funções desempenhadas pelo parlamento, as quais,\n\nsegundo demonstrou, não se limitam à tradicional função legislativa. Tomando por base o\n\ncaso do congresso brasileiro, este autor mostrou existirem várias outras funções\n\ndesempenhadas pelo parlamento, uma das quais é a de legitimação, que pode chegar a ser –\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n23\n\ncomo aconteceu no período analisado pelo autor - mais relevante do que as funções mais\n\ntradicionais.\n\nNo final dos anos 70, Michael Mezey contribuiu com uma classificação dos\n\nparlamentos de acordo com dois critérios principais: “policy making” e “apoio”. Dentro da\n\ndimensão de “policy making”, Mezey distingue três níveis de intensidade de poder: fraco,\n\nmoderado e forte. No primeiro, o parlamento não detém poderes de modificação ou rejeição\n\ndas propostas do Governo; no mais forte, o parlamento consegue modificar e rejeitar estas\n\npropostas. Em função do grau de “apoio”, Mezey distingue os parlamentos consoante tenham\n\nmais ou menos apoio. Destas duas dimensões (apoio e “policy making”), resultam cinco tipos\n\nde parlamentos: vulneráveis, marginais, ativos, reativos e mínimos.\n\nConforme referido por Cristina Leston-Bandeira (2002), Philip Norton (1990) notou\n\nfaltar à tipologia de Mezey uma dimensão propositiva por parte do parlamento, tendo Norton\n\ncorrigido esta falha propondo a seguinte classificação: parlamentos “produtores” (os que não\n\napenas conseguem modificar ou rejeitar as propostas do Governo – como na classificação de\n\nMezey - como conseguem apresentar e aprovar propostas suas); parlamentos\n\n“influenciadores“ (conseguem modificar ou rejeitar as propostas do Governo mas não\n\napresentar e aprovar propostas suas) e, por fim, os parlamentos com “pouco ou nenhum\n\nimpacto”, que são os que não conseguem fazer nenhuma das coisas.\n\nTambém Amy Kreppel propôs uma tipologia para analisar os parlamentos,\n\nenquadrando-os como fortes ou fracos, dependendo do grau de autonomia institucional, por\n\num lado, e da autonomia individual e partidária, por outro. Em relação à primeira, a autora\n\nsalienta a importância de distinguir entre as características que decorrem da configuração\n\nconstitucional, que é mais rígida e estável, e as que decorrem da legislação ordinária ou da\n\nprática, situação que é mais flexível e pode mudar mais facilmente (Kreppel 2014). Por sua\n\nvez, as alterações ao nível da autonomia individual e partidária têm maior probabilidade de\n\nocorrer quando comparadas com as alterações ao nível institucional, podendo ocorrer através\n\nde alterações às leis eleitorais, ao financiamento partidário, aos estatutos partidários, etc.,\n\npodendo afetar a forma como os representantes e os partidos controlam o Governo. Ao reunir\n\nas variáveis institucionais e partidárias que afetam a autonomia legislativa, e a sua influência\n\nnas políticas, esta abordagem aplica-se a um leque variado de contextos políticos e permite\n\nexplicar mudanças ao longo do tempo.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n24\n\nFunções dos parlamentos\n\nSobre as funções dos parlamentos, Norton e Leston-Bandeira (2005) notam que os\n\nparlamentos modernos têm, nas últimas décadas, alargado a sua esfera de ação a novas áreas,\n\nmudança que tem impacto no papel desempenhado por estas instituições. Assim, a função\n\nlegislativa, predominante ao longo do século passado, foi dando lugar ao reforço da função de\n\ncontrolo do executivo (Müller e Sieberer 2014), situação que se verificou também em\n\nPortugal (Seguro 2016).\n\nContudo, a evolução mais recente é configurada também pelo envolvimento dos\n\nparlamentos com os cidadãos, que se traduz em várias dimensões, que vão da afirmação da\n\nidentidade da instituição parlamentar, que se abriu à comunidade (v.g. através de visitas,\n\nexposições, etc.), passando pela divulgação sem precedentes de informação sobre a atividade\n\nparlamentar, nomeadamente através da Internet, e pelo aumento de oportunidades para os\n\ncidadãos participarem na atividade deste órgão (v.g. audiências, petições, iniciativas\n\nlegislativas dos cidadãos, etc.).\n\nDe acordo com muitos dos teóricos da institucionalização dos parlamentos,\n\nparlamentos como o Português (cujo direito de petição é, recorde-se, objeto de estudo\n\ndetalhado na Parte III desta tese), bem como a maioria dos restantes da Europa do Sul que\n\nresultaram de processos de democratização tardios, estavam, nos anos 80 e 90, ainda em\n\npleno processo de institucionalização (Liebert e Cotta, 1990; Norton e Leston-Bandeira\n\n2005).\n\nTodavia, a evolução das últimas duas décadas mostra claramente que estes\n\nparlamentos lograram plenamente a institucionalização, sendo hoje parlamentos com as\n\nmesmas funções, níveis de autonomia e, em geral, os mesmos poderes que os seus congéneres\n\neuropeus com democracias mais maduras (Leston-Bandeira 2005; Tibúrcio 2017),\n\nnomeadamente no que diz respeito a esta última dimensão de envolvimento com os cidadãos.\n\n*\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n25\n\nOs parlamentos não têm, pois, ficado de braços cruzados face ao cenário de crescente\n\nafastamento entre eleitores e representantes. Não apenas a instituição representativa do\n\nparlamento continua a disseminar-se um pouco por todo o mundo (Fish e Kroenig 2009)\n\ncomo muitos parlamentos começaram a mostrar-se muito mais dinâmicos, relevando-se hoje\n\nmais ativos do que nunca (e, também, mais transparentes e acessíveis) a desenvolver ligações\n\ncom os cidadãos.\n\nCom efeito, a evolução mais recente é, como apontado, configurada pelo\n\nenvolvimento dos parlamentos com os cidadãos (Müller e Sieberer 2014, e Leston-Bandeira e\n\nTibúrcio 2015), conforme se pode ver, ilustrativamente, na figura 2.1. No entanto, esta\n\ndimensão encontra-se ainda ausente da maioria dos estudos sobre o papel dos parlamentos,\n\nnomeadamente quanto a dados empíricos.\n\nFigura 2.1. Página do Facebook do Parlamento britânico a explicar as diferentes formas de envolvimento dos cidadãos\n\nFonte: Facebook do Parlamento britânico, publicado a 04-09-201613\n\nEstas iniciativas têm-se multiplicado e introduzem mudanças significativas na relação\n\nrepresentativa entre parlamento e cidadãos.\n\nVale a pena recordar o enquadramento de Pitkin (1967), no qual propôs uma\n\nconceptualização da representação dividida em quatro dimensões: formalista, descritiva,\n\n13https://www.facebook.com/ukparliament/photos/a.10152172843377733.1073741825.16553417732/101544725\n\n48007733/?type=3&theater\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n26\n\nsimbólica e substantiva. Desde então, este consagrou-se como o principal quadro conceptual\n\nda representação parlamentar, em que se identificam quatro dimensões de representação,\n\npermitindo uma útil diferenciação metodológica com vários focos de análise. Do mesmo\n\nmodo, contribui também para sublinhar diferentes significados e caminhos para a\n\nrepresentação.\n\nRepresentação formalista é definida pela autora como \"a representação em termos de\n\ndar e ter autoridade\", referindo-se à geometria institucional em vigor que traduz a relação de\n\nrepresentação. Pode referir-se ao sistema eleitoral, mas também aos instrumentos de contacto\n\nentre representantes e eleitores.\n\nA representação descritiva e a simbólica estão relacionadas com a representação\n\nenquanto tomada de posição pelo representado. A primeira (a descritiva), refere-se\n\nespecificamente à medida em que os representantes espelham as características\n\nsociodemográficas dos seus representados. Ou seja, não é uma questão de o representante agir\n\nem nome de interesses específicos, mas de haver representação pelo simples facto de haver\n\nsemelhanças - ao nível de características pessoais - entre representado e representante (Pitkin\n\n1967, p. 61).\n\nRepresentação simbólica também se refere a “tomar posição por”. No entanto, não\n\ncom base nas semelhanças, mas nos símbolos, que, pela sua presença, fazem com que o\n\nsentido da representação esteja presente (Pitkin 1967, p. 92). Pitkin dá o exemplo da bandeira,\n\nque, em si mesmo, não passa de um pedaço de pano, mas pode desvendar, sublinhar, inculcar\n\ne tornar patente a identidade de toda uma nação. A representação simbólica não se limita,\n\nportanto, a agir em nome de determinados interesses ou a uma ligação eleitoral entre\n\nrepresentantes e representados (Leston-Bandeira e Tibúrcio 2015).\n\nPor fim, a representação substantiva refere-se a agir pelos - agir em nome dos representados, fazendo com que os interesses particulares estejam presentes no ato de\n\nrepresentação. É este, em suma, o sentido com que habitualmente se usa “representação\n\nparlamentar” no quotidiano.\n\nDestas quatro dimensões, os conceitos de representação descritiva, substantiva e\n\nformalista são aqueles que têm sido mais estudados. Contudo, a representação simbólica não\n\ntem sido particularmente valorizada pela literatura dos estudos parlamentares e institucionais,\n\no que é coerente com o que o parlamento foi ao longo da maior parte do século XX. No\n\nentanto, a representação formalista e simbólica são as duas dimensões mais afetadas pelos\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n27\n\ndesenvolvimentos a que assistimos nos parlamentos de hoje. E, por isso, aquelas que também\n\nmelhor ajudam a compreender estas mudanças, nomeadamente a relação entre parlamentos e\n\ncidadãos. Com efeito, a abertura do parlamento a formas de advocacy democracy, criando e\n\nalargando as oportunidades de acesso ao trabalho parlamentar por parte dos cidadãos,\n\nacrescentaram uma nova dimensão à perceção tradicional da representação formalista, que vai\n\nmuito além do elo liberal de prestação de contas (Leston-Bandeira e Tibúrcio 2015).\n\n2.2.1. A representação parlamentar – um conceito em mutação\n\nAo longo do século XIX e da expansão da democracia liberal na Europa, o parlamento\n\nteve sempre um papel central, que pressupunha que os cidadãos eram apenas chamados a\n\nparticipar no sistema político a cada quatro ou cinco anos, no momento das eleições. Este era\n\no chamado modelo elitista ou schumpeteriano. No entanto, este princípio foi\n\nprogressivamente sendo posto em causa ao longo do século XX, tendo o interesse pela\n\ndemocracia participativa crescido significativamente, bem como as experiências nesta área\n\n(Fung e Wright 2003; Rosenberg 2007; Smith 2009).\n\nA crescente expansão da democracia participativa acaba, assim, por questionar o\n\nmodelo de delegação tradicional, dando lugar à integração dos cidadãos na deliberação de\n\npolíticas públicas. Esta mudança teve sobretudo reflexos a dois níveis. Por um lado, na forma\n\ncomo os parlamentos funcionam, nomeadamente através da sua crescente abertura à\n\nsociedade. Por outro, no modo como se relacionam com os cidadãos, convocando algumas\n\nreminiscências de um papel que esteve na origem dos parlamentos, de fórum de apoio a\n\ndiscussão e comunicação entre grupos diversos (embora, naturalmente, num contexto social\n\nbem distinto).\n\nA literatura dos estudos parlamentares assume, assim, representação como\n\nrepresentação de interesses, sendo a discussão apenas sobre a medida em que os\n\nrepresentantes realmente representam interesses específicos e até que ponto deve haver algum\n\njuízo individual do representante nesse processo de representação.\n\nEmbora reconhecendo a importância fulcral da representação de interesses no sentido,\n\nna organização e na constituição de parlamentos, Leston-Bandeira nota que centrar somente\n\nnesta dimensão de representação impede compreender por completo a atividade de\n\nrepresentação parlamentar, em particular no contexto da sociedade moderna, onde é muito\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n28\n\nmais difícil identificar grupos homogéneos de interesses. “Os teóricos políticos têm\n\ndemonstrado que a representação é uma atividade muito mais multifacetada. A nosso ver, isso\n\né igualmente aplicável à representação parlamentar” (Leston-Bandeira 2016a).\n\nAquilo que podemos observar nos dias de hoje é que os eleitores são interpelados por\n\ninteresses muito mais fragmentados, podendo facilmente uma pessoa partilhar algumas\n\ncaracterísticas com um grupo de pessoas e outras características com grupos diversos,\n\nconsoante o estatuto socioeconómico, a região, por exemplo, sendo que algum desses\n\ninteresses pode até ser mais bem representado por partidos diferentes, indo ao encontro de\n\nSaward, quando diz que nenhum representante é capaz de representar completamente todos os\n\nnossos interesses ou identidades (Saward 2011).\n\nEsta fragmentação de interesses coloca novos desafios à representação parlamentar,\n\nque acrescem a outros com que se foi deparando ao longo da sua história recente, como a\n\n“revolução da escala” (Dahl 1996), que marca a distância entre as cidade-estado gregas de\n\npequena dimensão para a democracia norte-americana à escala federal, ou o alargamento do\n\nsufrágio, maxime o sufrágio universal. Todas estas transformações vieram ampliar o leque de\n\ninteresses incluídos na representação parlamentar.\n\nEsta complexidade de representação de interesses confere ao parlamento um lugar\n\nímpar na representação democrática, espelhando, deste modo, a variedade da sociedade. Por\n\noutro lado, o voto em eleições cinge-se a um partido e o cidadão de hoje pode ver-se\n\nrepresentado, mais do que antes, quanto à economia num partido mas quanto à politica\n\nambiental noutro. A participação fora do período de eleições facilita esta participação de\n\nnatureza mais poliédrica.\n\nEsta evolução teve um impacto ao nível da forma como se foi entendendo o momento\n\neleitoral, que foi deixando, assim, de ser o único elemento constitutivo da relação\n\nrepresentativa entre deputado e constituinte, embora continuando a ser, naturalmente, o\n\nprincipal mecanismo de aprovação ou desaprovação dos representantes (conferindo a\n\nlegitimidade ao vínculo representativo).\n\nConforme nota Leston-Bandeira, durante muito tempo a democracia participativa\n\nconsistia essencialmente numa política e prática informal que ocorria em paralelo com a\n\npolítica formal. Ora, isso mudou consideravelmente nos tempos mais recentes, constituindo\n\nexemplos disso a expansão do orçamento participativo de base local lançado em 1986, em\n\nPorto Alegre, no Brasil, ou os estilos de deliberação mini-públicos (Fung e Wright 2003;\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n29\n\nRosenberg 2007; Smith 2009; Geissel e Joas 2013). As eleições importam, naturalmente, mas\n\no que acontece entre eleições é cada vez mais importante, o que tem inevitáveis\n\nconsequências para o papel desempenhado pelo parlamento (Leston-Bandeira 2016a).\n\nA pressão por reformas políticas tem levado a um reforço sistemático de novos modos\n\nde democracia, nomeadamente democracia direta e \"advocacy\", reflexo de que a\n\nconceptualização da representação parlamentar apenas em torno do elo eleitoral não cobre\n\numa parte considerável da política moderna (Cain, Dalton e Scarrow 2003). No entanto, a\n\nexpansão dessas formas de democracia tem sido concomitante com a expansão da democracia\n\nrepresentativa, espelhada, por exemplo, na criação de novas instituições representativas\n\n(como os novos parlamentos da Escócia, Gales e Irlanda do Norte, em 1999, na sequência do\n\nprocesso de devolução de poderes).\n\nConsiderando o exposto, a expansão de novos modos de democracia não questiona a\n\nimportância da democracia representativa, ou do elo eletivo como forma fundamental de\n\ngarantir a legitimidade política. No entanto, sugere que é preciso alargar consideravelmente a\n\nnossa compreensão da representação, do parlamento e da democracia, com vista a\n\nentendermos plenamente o papel do parlamento moderno (Mediador, cfr. infra). De acordo\n\ncom este entendimento \"mais espesso\" (Alonso, Keane e Merkel 2011) de democracia\n\nrepresentativa, estaremos a testemunhar não tanto uma crise da democracia representativa,\n\nmas à transformação desta em algo novo (Schmitter 2011).\n\n2.2.2. O papel do parlamento: fases fundamentais e constrangimentos\n\nUm dos princípios fundamentais dos parlamentos é que estes são eleitos com base no\n\nprincípio de que os representantes agem em nome de seus representados. No entanto, este\n\npressuposto tem sido crescentemente questionado, seja, por exemplo, através dos indicadores\n\nde desaprovação do desempenho da instituição, como a elevada abstenção, seja através dos\n\nbaixos níveis de confiança no parlamento. Por outro lado, a expansão de formas não representativas de democracia também tem contribuído para pôr em causa este paradigma,\n\nembora isto não reflita necessariamente uma rejeição da função representativa (mas, muitas\n\nvezes, da forma como é exercida) nem uma diminuição do apoio difuso à democracia\n\nrepresentativa.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n30\n\nÉ, pois, neste quadro que devemos entender as razões do desenvolvimento do papel de\n\n'envolvimento parlamentar com o público' (public engagement), bem como o potencial que\n\npode desempenhar como ligação entre o público e o parlamento.\n\nMarongiu (1968) mostrou como o parlamento mudou desde os encontros ocasionais\n\nmedievais até aos órgãos institucionalizados para decisões vinculativas no século XVII.\n\nNestas mudanças consideráveis, avultou, porém, o papel de mediação entre a sociedade e a\n\ngovernação (Marongiu 1968).\n\nAs reuniões consultivas medievais levaram, a determinada altura, ao que Cristina\n\nLeston-Bandeira (2016b) denomina como Parlamento “Clube de Cavalheiros” do século XIX.\n\nEste parlamento era uma reunião de dignitários, pequena e elitista, com uma ligação muito\n\nfluida e próxima do Governo. Nesta altura, o direito de voto era muito limitado, havendo\n\nquase uma sobreposição entre aqueles que podiam votar e os que estavam no poder. O\n\ntrabalho parlamentar constituía-se sobretudo através de grandes debates e legislação mínima,\n\nsem verdadeira ligação com o resto da sociedade.\n\nDe acordo com a referida autora, ao Parlamento “clube de cavalheiros” sucedeu o\n\n“Parlamento Representante”, que marca todo o século XX, sendo, assim, contemporâneo com\n\no desenvolvimento dos partidos de massas e a expansão do direito de voto. A governação\n\ntorna-se mediada pelo sistema partidário e os partidos tornam-se os principais atores políticos.\n\nA expansão da área de intervenção do Governo vai ditando a crescente assunção pelo\n\nexecutivo da função legislativa, com o parlamento a assumir crescentemente funções de\n\nescrutínio e de representação, a par da função legislativa. A participação política ocorre\n\nprincipalmente por via das eleições, de quatro em quatro anos, e o parlamento age de acordo\n\ncom o modelo de delegação. A representação parlamentar está intimamente associada ao ato\n\neleitoral e a interesses específicos. Enquadra-se, portanto, principalmente nas noções de\n\nrepresentação substantiva e descritiva de Pitkin (1967).\n\nCom o dealbar do século XXI, emerge o “Parlamento Mediador” (Leston-Bandeira\n\n2016b). Neste, os cidadãos assumem um papel cada vez mais central, ou seja, para além da\n\nrelação com o Executivo, o parlamento passa a desenvolver também uma relação ativa com os\n\ncidadãos nos momentos entre eleições, continuando, porém, primordiais as funções de legislar\n\ne de fiscalizar o executivo. É, pois, neste contexto que há um desenvolvimento da função de\n\n'envolvimento com o público' (public engagement), não só através de uma maior abertura e\n\ntransparência da instituição e dos seus trabalhos, mas também de um maior envolvimento dos\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n31\n\ncidadãos, às suas opiniões sobre a gestão da coisa pública. Num contexto caracterizado por\n\numa cidadania informada e pela expansão de formas de democracia participativa, o\n\nParlamento volta a assumir um papel fundamental como mediador entre sociedade e\n\ngovernação.\n\nA par desta evolução, vão-se tornando cada vez mais visíveis constrangimentos vários\n\nque se vão colocando aos parlamentos ao longo do século XX e, em particular, das décadas\n\nmais recentes. Constrangimentos que passam pela crescente influência política de entidades\n\nnão maioritárias (como a crescente influência dos bancos centrais), que, para muitos autores\n\n(Schmitter e Treschel 2004; Freire 2015), põem hoje em risco as instituições chave da\n\ndemocracia representativa, entre as quais sobreleva o Parlamento14. Esta influência distingue se do que acontecia no passado, na medida em que “o novo estatuto das ‘instituições guardiãs’\n\nimplica que sejam impermeáveis ao controlo popular” (Fernandes 2014).\n\nAndré Freire (2015) identifica três “revoluções contemporâneas”, cujo desfecho ainda\n\nse desconhece, e que de algum modo ameaçam o poder da democracia representativa,\n\nmaxime, dos parlamentos. São elas as seguintes: i) o “crescimento das autoridades não\n\neleitas” (as referidas entidades não maioritárias); ii) a “governação multinível” e iii)\n\nfinalmente, a da “boa governança”. A primeira prende-se com o crescente poder de entidades\n\nque não têm qualquer legitimidade ou têm-na apenas parcialmente (tribunais superiores e\n\nconstitucionais mas, também, desde há algum tempo a esta parte, bancos centrais, entidades\n\nde regulação económica e sociais, etc.). Independentemente da bondade das suas decisões,\n\nalgumas destas entidades têm muitas vezes competência para tomarem decisões sobre a\n\nconformação de políticas, e não meramente sobre a execução das mesmas, nomeadamente das\n\nleis, como acontece com o poder judicial. Comprimindo o espaço de liberdade da decisão\n\ndemocrática e não sendo, porém, responsabilizáveis pelos cidadãos nem pelos seus\n\nrepresentantes. Os defensores do poder destas entidades enaltecem, no entanto, a virtude desta\n\nalternativa em relação à política partidária e ideológica (Majone 1998 e 2005; Moravcsik\n\n200215). A segunda revolução é representada emblematicamente pela UE, nomeadamente pela\n\ndelegação de poderes soberanos das autoridades nacionais para esta entidade supranacional.\n\nPor razões que aponta (v.g. a “gigantesca” dimensão da UE, a ausência de um demos, a\n\nheterogeneidade social, étnica e cultural, e o intergovernamentalismo), considera o autor que\n\n14 Para uma recensão dos principais riscos apontados, ver Alonso, Keane e Merkel (2011) 15 Apud Freire 2005\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n32\n\na UE padece, assim, de várias deformações institucionais, que ajudam a explicar o mau\n\nfuncionamento da UE de hoje. Finalmente, a ameaça da ”boa governança”, que incentiva a\n\npartilha dos centros de poder político entre entidades representativas como os parlamentos e\n\nentidades da sociedade civil – agências, autoridades e organizações – (na linha de Burns et al\n\n2000), igualizando-as em importância às instituições democráticas representativas,\n\ntransformando as eleições em “meros rituais cívicos” (Schmitter 201116).\n\nImporta ainda realçar visões preocupadas e, de algum modo, pessimistas acerca da\n\nsaúde da democracia representativa, entre as quais se destaca a de Peter Mair (2013)17. A já\n\nreferida desvalorização da política, através do crescente poder de entidades não eleitas,\n\nlegitimado muitas vezes pelos próprios políticos, quando se apresentam como «não políticos»,\n\nalimentando o populismo antipolítica. Por outro lado, o esbatimento das diferenças entre os\n\nprincipais partidos, enfraquecendo a capacidade de o eleitor poder escolher políticas\n\nalternativas, é outro dos fatores frequentemente apontado como ajudando à degradação da\n\nrelação entre eleitores e eleitos.\n\nNo entanto, apesar dos constrangimentos referidos, que degradam frequentemente a\n\nqualidade da democracia representativa, muitas instituições parlamentares têm procurado\n\nativamente caminhos que os contrariem, com o fito de criar e reforçar laços com os cidadãos.\n\nÉ sobre isto que nos debruçamos de seguida. E, como iremos ver, os sistemas de petições\n\nconstituíram um relevante instrumento deste ensejo de aproximação aos cidadãos.\n\n2.2.3. A relação entre parlamento e cidadãos - uma prática recente e crescente\n\nConforme apontado, a atividade parlamentar de 'envolvimento do público' expandiu-se\n\nconsideravelmente desde o início do século XXI. Muitos parlamentos já tinham, desde há\n\nalgum tempo, atividades especificamente orientadas para os cidadãos, embora estas fossem,\n\nem geral e por regra, atividades específicas, avulsas, e não identificadas como tal. Nestas\n\nincluem-se os serviços de visita, por exemplo, ou a prestação de informações sobre a\n\ninstituição, nomeadamente com foco na vertente pedagógica e educativa. O que distingue a\n\núltima década e meia em relação ao que se passava anteriormente é em grande medida a\n\nprofissionalização desse papel, através de um investimento nesta área, que se manifesta na\n\n16 Idem 17 Também podíamos referir Hermet (2008) ou Diamond (2015).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n33\n\ncriação de novos serviços especificamente responsáveis pelo envolvimento com os cidadãos e\n\npelo desenvolvimento de novas atividades. Com esta mudança, passou-se de uma fase em que\n\nos parlamentos eram meramente reativos, limitando-se a responder às pessoas que se\n\naproximavam do Parlamento em busca de informações, para uma atitude mais ativa,\n\nprocurando levar o parlamento à generalidade dos cidadãos, disseminando informação sobre o\n\nseu papel, cujo desconhecimento é, tantas vezes, fonte de preconceitos e avaliações\n\nenviesadas sobre o papel desempenhado por esta instituição no sistema político.\n\nEstas mudanças tornaram-se mais visíveis em meados da década passada,\n\nnomeadamente em vários parlamentos europeus, mas também na América latina e do norte\n\n(Leston-Bandeira e Tibúrcio 2015; IPU 2012). Merece realce a influência que a criação do\n\nnovo parlamento escocês teve, em 1999, exatamente na viragem do século, fundado no\n\nprincípio de que deveria ser uma instituição aberta ao público e incentivadora da participação\n\ndos cidadãos, o que se traduziu, desde o início, num nível significativo de atividade no âmbito\n\ndo envolvimento do público com o parlamento. A verdade é que este sucesso foi o catalisador\n\npara certas mudanças noutros parlamentos, que viram o caso escocês como exemplo a seguir\n\nneste domínio. Foi o que aconteceu com o parlamento do Reino Unido ou com o Parlamento\n\nalemão (ao nível das petições, como iremos ver), sendo também possível ver invocar-se o\n\nexemplo escocês nas recentes reformas políticas em Marrocos (na sequência da aprovação de\n\numa nova Constituição em 2011), a propósito da discussão sobre petições públicas e de outras\n\niniciativas com vista a ampliar o leque de instrumentos de participação da sociedade civil\n\n(como as moções legislativas ou iniciativas legislativas dos cidadãos).\n\nAinda que com níveis muito diferentes de desenvolvimento, é inegável, desde a\n\nviragem do século, o investimento feito por parlamentos no mundo inteiro no\n\ndesenvolvimento das potencialidades para os seus cidadãos se envolverem com a instituição\n\nparlamentar. Muitos destes exemplos de envolvimento com o público encontram-se\n\nevidenciados em relatórios internacionais (como o IPU 2012), assumindo-se, crescentemente,\n\ncomo um dos papéis relevantes desempenhados pelos parlamentos na nossa sociedade, para\n\nalém, como referido, das funções tradicionais de legislação e de controlo.\n\nExemplos deste tipo de atividade incluem casos tão variados como a disponibilização\n\nde informação numa página da Internet ou a potencial participação em iniciativas legislativas\n\n– ou seja, desde a mera disponibilização de informação, à própria participação na atividade\n\nparlamentar. Pelo meio incluem-se também atividades pedagógicas que pretendem educar o\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n34\n\ncidadão (de que são exemplo paradigmático os programas “parlamentos dos jovens”, cujo\n\nsucesso tem sido assinalável em vários parlamentos).\n\nMuitos parlamentos limitam-se aos primeiros níveis de 'envolvimento do público', ou\n\nseja, à disponibilização de informação. Mas outros há que incluem não só todos os níveis de\n\n'envolvimento do público' (da informação à participação), como também uma oferta muito\n\ncomplexa de vários tipos de atividades. É o caso, por exemplo, do Congresso Brasileiro,\n\nnomeadamente através do programa e-Democracia, que permite, entre outras ferramentas de\n\nparticipação, aos eleitores enviarem comentários sobre legislação em apreciação (ferramenta\n\nque, embora discreta, também existe na Assembleia da República, em Portugal), e mais tarde\n\ncom o Portal e-Cidadania do Senado (Leston-Bandeira e Tibúrcio 2015).\n\nOs instrumentos de ligação entre parlamento e cidadãos têm merecido um impulso\n\nclaro nos últimos anos, o que se manifesta através de inúmeras iniciativas, nomeadamente\n\naproveitando as potencialidades das Tecnologias de Informação e Comunicação. É o caso dos\n\nrecentes exemplos no Reino Unido e em Portugal. O primeiro, com os trabalhos da Digital\n\nDemocracy Committee (2015), cujas recomendações começaram a ser implementadas no\n\ninício de 2015. O segundo, com a criação, em 2016, do Grupo de Trabalho para o Parlamento\n\nDigital, com mandato para eleborar, até ao final do ano, um relatório com recomendações que\n\ncontribuam para aproximar o Parlamento dos seus cidadãos.\n\nO envolvimento dos cidadãos com os parlamentos tem sido procurado tanto numa\n\ncomunicação mais direta e regular entre cidadão e instituição, como em ferramentas como as\n\niniciativas legislativas dos cidadãos ou as petições.\n\nEm relação às iniciativas legislativas dos cidadãos, existem sinais de um crescente\n\ninteresse por estes instrumentos de participação, cada vez mais disseminados (Setälä e\n\nSchiller 2012). A taxa de adesão a esta ferramenta é ainda bastante tímida quando comparada\n\ncom as petições, o que se deverá em parte ao maior formalismo exigido para a sua\n\napresentação ao parlamento (seja em termos da forma como tem de ser escrita, seja em termos\n\ndo número mínimo de assinaturas exigido), conforme explicamos, aliás, mais à frente. São\n\nestes maiores constrangimentos formais que poderão ajudar a explicar a razão para que,\n\nnalguns países, esta ferramenta tenha sido de algum modo monopolizada por grupos de\n\ninteresse e pelos próprios partidos políticos (Setälä e Schiller 2012).\n\nNa Europa, é possível apontar alguns poucos exemplos bem-sucedidos – embora\n\ntímidos - desta ferramenta, como, por exemplo, o caso holandês (Andeweg 2012), embora\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n35\n\nseja na América Latina que se encontrem, hoje, exemplos de maior vitalidade deste instituto\n\n(Leston-Bandeira 2012a). Beetham (2011) considera, aliás, que a integração deste\n\ninstrumento no processo parlamentar, abrindo o impulso legislativo aos cidadãos, mas\n\ndeixando a decisão final na inteira disponibilidade dos representantes, poderá ser uma das\n\nformas de revitalizar o parlamento face aos cidadãos. Com estas características institucionais\n\n(um autêntico direito de marcação da agenda legislativa do parlamento), podemos encontrar\n\neste instrumento na Polónia, Portugal, Espanha ou Finlândia, mas também, fora da Europa, no\n\nBrasil.\n\nEm relação às petições, estas constituem porventura a ferramenta baseada na\n\nparticipação dos cidadãos mais enraizada e consolidada, oferecendo a esmagadora maioria\n\ndos parlamentos europeus um sistema de petições parlamentares, embora com níveis\n\ndiferentes de implementação prática. Apesar de sistemas como o francês revelarem sinais de\n\ndeclínio deste instrumento, são muitos os impulsos modernizadores deste direito em vários\n\nparlamentos europeus, como é possível ver no caso alemão, português, irlandês,\n\nluxemburguês, do Parlamento Europeu, ou o recente caso do Reino Unido.

Não apenas este é um direito regulado pela lei, como\n\no seu exercício tem vindo a ser facilitado e incentivado, tanto pelo legislador como pelos\n\nparlamentos.\n\nPasquino distingue três modalidades de participação política: legal, semi-legal e ilegal.\n\nNa primeira cabem todas as formas previstas no ordenamento jurídico e aceites como\n\nlegítimas. Nas “semi-legais” incluem-se as formas de participação que não têm acolhimento\n\nlegal mas que são consentidas, desde que não ponham em causa a estabilidade do sistema\n\npolítico18. Finalmente, as “ilegais” são as que não são nem reconhecidas nem aceites,\n\n18 Pasquino, apud Meirinho\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n38\n\natribuindo-se-lhes um efeito pernicioso sobre o sistema político. De acordo com esta\n\ndistinção, o direito de petição afigura-se claramente como uma forma legal de participação,\n\nconforme resulta da sua previsão no quadro jurídico, nomeadamente na constituição ou na lei,\n\nsendo por esta última normalmente configurada como uma forma de participação que visa a\n\ndefesa de direitos ou do interesse geral (ou ambos), mas também como direito a um\n\nprocedimento, com regras que o condicionam. Distinguem-se das formas de participação não\n\nconvencionais, que são as ilegítimas ou não consentidas. Esta distinção nem sempre é fácil de\n\nfazer. Sobretudo quando comparamos com o mesmo direito mas inserido em contextos\n\nnacionais diferentes e o que é legítimo ou ilegítimo pode variar de cultura para cultura19.\n\nO direito de iniciativa legislativa ou de referendo dos cidadãos enquadra-se na mesma\n\nforma convencional de participação, tal como outros direitos de participação política, como o\n\ndireito de voto, o referendo ou o direito de queixa junto do Ombudsman.\n\nContrariamente ao que sucede, por exemplo, com a generalidade das formas de\n\nparticipação convencional (como o direito de voto, o financiamento de partidos ou a\n\nparticipação em campanhas eleitorais), o direito de petição não se traduz numa qualquer\n\n“forma de apoio ao sistema político”. Isto distingue o direito de petição de outras formas de\n\nparticipação convencionais, que se associam frequentemente à expressão de apoio ao sistema\n\npolítico, aos governantes e às instituições, enquanto as formas não convencionais se associam\n\nà expressão de exigências (Meirinho e Sá 2005).\n\nNa generalidade dos sistemas, esta é uma forma de “participação direta”, que depende\n\napenas do peticionário, embora existam sistemas (raros) em que o exercício deste direito\n\ncarece da intermediação de um deputado (cfr. infra). O direito de petição distingue-se, assim,\n\ndo direito de queixa junto do Ombudsman, que se caracteriza por ser uma forma indireta de\n\nparticipação, agindo o provedor como mediador ou mesmo substituto do queixoso na sua\n\nrelação com as entidades destinatárias da queixa20. Também se podem incluir neste âmbito\n\nexigências de exercício coletivo deste direito. Por regra, o direito de petição pode ser usado\n\nindividual ou coletivamente, distinguindo-se de outros direitos de participação convencionais\n\nque só podem ser usados coletivamente, como a iniciativa legislativa dos cidadãos.\n\nO facto de o direito de petição consumar-se num contacto com os eleitos sugere que\n\neste seja enquadrado, de acordo com a tipologia de Milbrath (Milbrath e Goel 1976), como\n\num “contacto especializado”. Contudo, este é definido, segundo o autor, como destinado à\n\n19 Geraint Parry, et al. (1992), apud Meirinho (2003).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n39\n\ndefesa de assuntos estritamente particulares, não se envolvendo estes cidadãos nos assuntos\n\npolíticos. Ora, isto distancia este modo de ação do direito de petição, que é efetivamente uma\n\nforma de os cidadãos se dirigirem aos eleitos, mas podendo ser tanto para prosseguir o\n\ninteresse geral como particular, ou mesmo apenas para prossecução do interesse geral (ver\n\ninfra). Em nenhum dos sistemas da UE se prevê um sistema de petição que admita apenas\n\npetições que visem o interesse particular. Assim, continuando na senda da tipologia de\n\nMilbrath, o direito de petição tal como está consagrado modernamente situar-se-á algures\n\nentre o “contacto especializado” (por constituir uma forma de os cidadãos se dirigirem aos\n\neleitos) e as “atividades de comunicação”, de que são exemplos o envio de cartas a diretores\n\nde jornais, de mensagens de apoio ou de protesto aos dirigentes políticos.\n\nPor outro lado, o direito de petição tem um “âmbito de ação” muito variado, podendo\n\ngenericamente debruçar-se sobre quaisquer matérias de interesse geral da competência –\n\nlegislativa, fiscalizadora - do Parlamento e, em muitos sistemas, também poder ser usado para\n\ndefesa de direitos (onde sobreleva um interesse pessoal do peticionário). Não tendo como\n\ncritério a existência de um interesse particular, também não exige necessariamente que os\n\npeticionários sejam afetados pela questão demandada pela petição.\n\nSegundo Verba (1987), o “grau de esforço” exigido reporta-se aos obstáculos legais e\n\ninstitucionais ao exercício do direito, ou seja, tem em conta as diligências e o esforço exigido\n\nao peticionário para poder utilizar o instrumento de participação em causa. Naturalmente,\n\nquanto mais complexas as exigências, maior esforço exigirá para o seu uso. Inserem-se neste\n\nâmbito os requisitos de forma (número de assinaturas, exigência de forma mais ou menos\n\narticulada, etc.). Assim, o grau de esforço exigido aos peticionários é reduzido, podendo, de\n\num modo geral, as petições ser apresentadas individualmente, por diversos meios, entre os\n\nquais, em muitos sistemas, o E-mail ou formulário eletrónico21, desde que por escrito.\n\nA “visibilidade social” é outro critério a ter em conta. De acordo com Sani, que o\n\npropôs, as novas formas de participação caracterizam-se por uma maior visibilidade. Deste\n\nponto de vista, o direito de petição tornou-se muito mais visível a partir do momento em que\n\nalguns sistemas de petição se modernizaram e passaram a disponibilizar as petições e muitas\n\nvezes o seu procedimento na Internet. Como veremos, estes sistemas ainda não se encontram\n\ngeneralizados mas são cada vez em maior número. Mas existe ainda outra dimensão a\n\n20 Meirinho e Sá, 2005. 21 Por regra, disponibilizado pelo site do parlamento, surgindo apenas os espaços em branco que o peticionário deve preencher, facilitando, assim, o seu exercício.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n40\n\ndestacar no que à visibilidade diz respeito. Exercido individualmente, é improvável que\n\nobtenha qualquer tipo de visibilidade, para além daquela que é hoje permitida pelos sistemas\n\nde petições-E (publicação no site do parlamento da petição e do respetivo processo). No\n\nentanto, o exercício coletivo deste direito é, muito frequentemente, feito com o intuito de\n\ncolher a maior atenção possível no espaço público, inclusivamente mediática22. Esta procura\n\nde atenção começa frequentemente no momento de recolha de assinaturas, em papel ou na\n\nInternet, e, nos sistemas que o admitem23, no momento de entrega formal da petição. A\n\nvisibilidade também varia (e aumenta) em função da visibilidade do seu autor. Nos casos em\n\nque a petição é submetida por uma entidade coletiva conhecida (como um sindicato), a sua\n\nvisibilidade social tende a aumentar24.\n\nA “frequência” com que pode ser usado é extremamente ampla. Em princípio, não está\n\nlimitada (exceto, por exemplo, na reapreciação do mesmo pedido com os mesmos\n\nfundamentos), podendo o autor de uma petição apresentar o número de petições que entender.\n\nEsta característica prende-se com uma outra que lhe está associada, isto é, o facto de a\n\niniciativa do exercício depender exclusivamente do peticionário, assim como a escolha do\n\ntiming e do objeto da petição, favorecendo-se, assim, uma participação menos dirigida pelas\n\nelites (top-down) e mais dirigida às elites (bottom-up) (Leston-Bandeira 2012).\n\nO envolvimento dos peticionários no processo parlamentar de petições é mais ou\n\nmenos intenso, dependendo do caso, e que pode variar consideravelmente (nalguns casos, o\n\npeticionário pode ser ouvido pela comissão, propor entidades a serem consultadas, etc.). Em\n\nprincípio, o peticionário tem “direito a uma resposta” e a ver a sua petição apreciada pelo\n\nParlamento. Mas não existe qualquer direito a uma decisão favorável (independentemente do\n\nnúmero de assinaturas), mantendo-se a decisão final nas mãos dos representantes.\n\nDeste modo, o direito de petição enquadra-se claramente como uma forma de\n\nadvocacy democracy, distinguindo-se, assim, por um lado, das formas mais puras de\n\ndemocracia representativa (ex: eleições), e, por outro, de formas de democracia direta, nas\n\nquais as decisões finais dependem dos cidadãos - ou são fortemente influenciadas por estes\n\n22 Este objetivo encontra-se espelhado em vários textos e entrevistas a peticionários da Escócia (Carman 2006) e da Alemanha (Riehm, Böhle e Lindner 2014). 23 Como em Portugal, em que as petições com mais de 4000 assinaturas têm sido, frequentemente, recebidas pelo Presidente da Assembleia da República ou por um dos vice-Presidentes, quando tenham competências delegadas nesta matéria. 24 O mesmo se passando com o direito de queixa junto do Provedor, cfr. Martins e Sá (2005)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n41\n\n(como tipicamente são os referendos – ou plebiscitos, como por vezes são designados25 - ou\n\nas iniciativas populares).\n\nImporta ainda distinguir o direito de submeter petições (perante o parlamento) de um\n\noutro modo de ação política, com o qual, por vezes, se confunde: a mera assinatura de\n\npetições. Contrariamente ao que se passa com o direito de submeter petições (que\n\ndescrevemos acima), este direito de assinar ou subscrever petições surge frequentemente\n\nenquadrado pela literatura entre as formas de participação não convencionais (Almond 1974,\n\nque associa esta forma de participação à mudança dos regimes; Kaase e March 1979, que\n\nenquadram como forma de protesto, sendo um dos instrumentos do repertório da ação política\n\ndo cidadão inativo; Viegas, Teixeira e Amador 2015, que enquadram como participação de\n\nprotesto) ou novas formas de participação (Sani 1989, a par das greves não autorizadas ou da\n\nocupação de edifícios públicos).\n\nA nosso ver, duas razões estão na origem desta confusão. Por um lado, o facto de\n\napenas recentemente este direito ter sido procedimentalizado, como aconteceu em países\n\ncomo Portugal, no início da década de 90, passando este direito a ser não apenas permitido\n\nmas regulado (nomeadamente quanto ao procedimento) pela lei. Por outro, o objeto deste\n\nestudo são os autores das petições (sendo apenas neste sentido que é usado o termo\n\n“peticionários”, que são os responsáveis pelo texto da petição e os únicos que são titulares de\n\ndireitos do processo: que são notificados pelo Parlamento, ouvidos em comissão, etc.). Estes\n\nnão são confundíveis com os signatários das petições, que se limitam a aderir, por via da sua\n\nassinatura, ao texto da petição, não tendo qualquer outra participação nem sendo sujeitos de\n\nquaisquer direitos processuais. Por regra, são estes signatários a que se reportam os estudos\n\nque se limitam a perguntar se \"já assinaram alguma petição\" (pergunta que surge por vezes\n\nacoplada à assinatura de \"abaixo assinados\").\n\n*\n\nA delimitação do alcance do direito de petição é, assim, o primeiro esteio em que deve\n\nassentar uma qualquer avaliação deste direito. Este direito destina-se a dar uma voz aos\n\ncidadãos mas não existe qualquer direito a uma decisão favorável, pelo que não deve, deste\n\nmodo, este critério ser visto como um parâmetro da eficácia do sistema de petições. Por outro\n\nlado, o seu alcance deve igualmente ser compreendido à luz das competências da entidade a\n\nque se dirige - neste caso, o parlamento, destacando-se as suas funções legislativas e de\n\n25 Pereira e Tibúrcio (2017)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n42\n\ncontrolo. Citando Hough, \"in evaluating the effectiveness of legislative petition systems, it is\n\nimportant to emphasize that it is not the role of parliament to deliver policy, but instead to\n\nallow policy to be debated and scrutinized\" (Hough 2012, pp. 487).\n\nDeste modo, se, por exemplo, uma petição solicitar a construção de um hospital ou\n\nprotestar contra o encerramento de uma escola, a petição não está na realidade a instar que o\n\nparlamento construa um hospital ou que mantenha aberta uma escola (isto são competências\n\nexecutivas, da alçada do Governo, que o parlamento não pode invadir, em respeito ao\n\nprincípio da separação de poderes) mas que o parlamento exerça a sua função de controlo, isto\n\né, por exemplo, que questione o ministério responsável, que exija respostas, eventualmente\n\nque chame o membro do Governo para ser ouvido no parlamento ou que debata a petição.\n\nAssim, é a esta luz (do que o sistema pode oferecer) que devem ser considerados os\n\ncritérios que servem para avaliar a eficácia do direito de petição.\n\nNa maioria dos sistemas, o direito de petição efetiva-se através de um procedimento\n\nque resulta da previsão legal. Tipicamente, terá o curso que se ilustra no quadro seguinte:\n\nFigura 3.1.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n46\n\nFonte: Elaboração própria.\n\nAtenta a análise do regime normativo em vigor nos países parlamentos da UE (mais\n\nEscócia e Parlamento Europeu), podemos distinguir três tipos de parlamentos:\n\ni) Os que não preveem um sistema de petições perante o parlamento;\n\nii) Os que preveem um sistema de petições estritamente convencional;\n\niii) Os que preveem um sistema de petições modernizado, i.e., de petições-E.\n\ni) Os que não preveem um sistema de petições perante o parlamento\n\nSão raros os parlamentos da UE que não dispõem de um sistema de petições.\n\nEncontram-se nesta situação os parlamentos (câmaras baixas) da Dinamarca, Estónia,\n\nFinlândia, Polónia, Suécia e Chipre.\n\nEstas exceções explicam-se, em grande medida, pela influência do Ombudsman,\n\nfigura com origem no início do século XIX (na Suécia) e que se generalizou no século XX a\n\npartir dos exemplos dos países escandinavos. Esta entidade atua em defesa e promoção dos\n\ndireitos, liberdades e garantias dos cidadãos, procurando assegurar, através de meios\n\ninformais, a justiça e a legalidade da atividade dos poderes públicos (o Provedor não decide\n\nnem o seu parecer é vinculativo, mas influencia com base na sua autoridade). Naqueles\n\npaíses, a relevância do Ombudsman na defesa dos direitos dos cidadãos junto da\n\nAdministração, bem como a sua grande implantação e lastro histórico, tornam o desempenho\n\ndas suas funções próximo do que se pode encontrar nas petições parlamentares.\n\nRiehm, Böhle, e Lindner (2014, pp. 207) ensaiam ainda uma explicação adicional para\n\no facto de estes países não consagrarem este direito, que se prende com tratarem-se,\n\nmaioritariamente, de democracias com um elevado nível de negociação, com governos\n\nminoritários que requerem compromissos com diversas forças partidárias, estando por esta via\n\nrepresentados no poder (nomeadamente no Parlamento) uma maior pluralidade de interesses.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n47\n\nii) os que preveem um sistema de petições estritamente convencional\n\nA grande maioria dos sistemas analisados garante um sistema de petições\n\nconvencional. Este sistema caracteriza-se, no essencial, por manter em vigor o mesmo\n\nenquadramento das últimas décadas, nomeadamente em termos de publicidade e visibilidade\n\ndas petições e do seu processo. Com efeito, neste sistema apenas o peticionário e o\n\nparlamento (e, no parlamento, apenas os que lidam diretamente com a petição) têm\n\npossibilidade de acompanhar e verificar o estado da petição. De igual modo, as várias\n\ndiligências e vicissitudes por que passa a petição, desde a sua entrada até ao relatório final\n\n(passando por eventuais perguntas ao Governo, respetivas respostas, debates ou eventuais\n\naudições) são, por regra, apenas do conhecimento do peticionário, deputados e pessoal do\n\nparlamento envolvidos, estando apenas acessíveis a estes.\n\nAssim configurado, estes sistemas de petição não estão disponíveis para\n\nacompanhamento e escrutínio da comunidade, exceto através da (normalmente episódica)\n\nintervenção dos media, algo que os peticionários não podem, naturalmente, tomar como\n\ngarantido.\n\nConstituem exemplos deste tipo de sistemas o caso francês, espanhol, belga, entre\n\noutros, mas, também, uma parte significativa do sistema alemão, cuja natureza permanece, no\n\nessencial, convencional, estando nestas condições a larga maioria das petições aí submetidas,\n\nembora este sistema do Bundestag coexista com um moderno sistema de petições-E,\n\nconforme melhor se detalha abaixo.\n\niii) os que preveem um sistema de petições modernizado, i.e., de petições-E\n\nNo início da década passada (2000), alguns parlamentos procuraram revitalizar este\n\ndireito, nomeadamente através das tecnologias de informação, que desempenham um papel\n\ncada vez mais importante na comunicação e na formação da opinião pública, tendo-se tornado\n\nferramentas fundamentais no relacionamento entre as instituições políticas e o público\n\n(Leston-Bandeira 2009).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n48\n\nAlguns parlamentos fizeram uma associação simples entre o direito de petição e as\n\nTIC e viram nisto uma forma de responder a alguns dos desafios enfrentados pelas\n\ndemocracias de hoje, tais como apatia política e a distância entre os cidadãos, políticos e\n\ninstituições políticas chave.\n\nLindner e Riehm (2011) identificaram três níveis diferentes de funcionalidades\n\neletrónicas associadas aos sistemas de petições, conforme se mostra na tabela seguinte:\n\nQuadro 3.5. Níveis de funcionalidades eletrónicas nas petições\n\n1 Quando uma petição pode ser submetida por E-mail ou através de uma\n\nplataforma eletrónica.\n\n2\n\nSistema de petições-E\n\nQuando as petições são publicadas na Internet, independentemente da forma\n\ncomo foram submetidas (por via convencional ou eletrónica). Nesta, não apenas\n\no texto das petições é publicado, mas também a informação relevante do\n\nprocesso de apreciação (fase em que se encontra, datas, etc.) e os principais\n\ndocumentos em causa (como as perguntas ao Governo e respetivas respostas ou\n\no relatório final).\n\n3 Quando o sistema promove ativamente o envolvimento de um público mais\n\nvasto (e não apenas os autores da petição) para o debate das petições - ou dos\n\ntemas que invocam - através de fóruns online.\n\nFonte: adaptado de Lindner e Riehm (2011)\n\nNo primeiro caso, o direito de petição torna-se simplesmente mais fácil de exercer.\n\nIsto não quer dizer que não possa ter consequências importantes, como, por exemplo, ao nível\n\nda população que pode usar este direito, isto é, do perfil dos peticionários. Contudo, apesar\n\ndesta inovação, as características do sistema mantêm-se, no essencial, inalteradas, isto é,\n\nmantém-se como sistema convencional.\n\nNo segundo nível, (n.º 2 da tabela), o sistema de petições torna-se público, ajudando a\n\ndisseminar o teor da petição por um público mais alargado. Deste modo, todas as petições e o\n\nrespetivo processo passam a poder ser acompanhadas e escrutinadas por qualquer cidadão,\n\nincluindo os media.\n\nFinalmente, o terceiro nível possibilita também a realização de discussões online sobre\n\na petição, permitindo recolher novas ideias e reações à petição originalmente apresentada.\n\nTambém pode ser útil para os deputados, “as it acts as a sounding platform to ascertain the\n\nvalue of the points being made” (Leston-Bandeira e Tibúrcio 2014).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n49\n\nApenas a partir do segundo nível podemos falar de um “sistema de petições\n\neletrónico”, ou seja, uma combinação de partes reunidas que concorrem para um resultado, e\n\né nesse sentido que utilizamos, de ora em diante neste trabalho, o termo “sistema de petições E”. Com efeito, ao passarem a estar online, os Parlamentos visam tornar-se instituições mais\n\ntransparentes, abertas e acessíveis e promover o diálogo e uma participação mais ativa dos\n\ncidadãos no processo político.\n\nImporta realçar, porém, que a modernização deste direito não se esgotou nas TIC,\n\nsendo estes sistemas, em todos os exemplos de modernização abaixo identificados,\n\nacompanhados de uma valorização das instâncias de participação dos peticionários, como, por\n\nexemplo, as audições e os debates (em sessão plenária, nas comissões, com membros do\n\nGoverno), ou seja, de funcionalidades convencionais. No entanto, o seu traço distintivo é a\n\nabertura do processo das petições, de cada petição, à comunidade, por via da Internet.\n\nO Parlamento escocês foi um dos pioneiros neste processo na Europa, uma vez que\n\ncriou em 1999 um sistema de petições em grande parte com base em meios eletrónicos e em\n\ngarantir instâncias de envolvimento com os cidadãos. Em 2005, foi a vez do parlamento\n\nportuguês e do parlamento alemão. Mais recentemente, podemos encontrar outros exemplos\n\nna Irlanda (2012) e no Luxemburgo (2014) (ver quadro 3.6). Em 2015, o Parlamento do Reino\n\nUnido em Westminster lançou um novo sistema de petições, envolvendo a criação de uma\n\nComissão das Petições, melhorando o sistema de petições-E e outras funcionalidades-chave\n\n(audições dos peticionários, perguntas ao Governo, etc.). Embora esteja em vigor apenas\n\ndesde 2015, é possível já constatar que o instituto do direito de petição parece ter voltado a\n\nmostrar uma vitalidade que não revelava desde o século XIX (Leston-Bandeira 2016b). Além\n\ndo caso escocês, há outros exemplos a nível regional (como o País de Gales) e também\n\nexperiências a nível local (Bristol, no Reino Unido, Malmö26, na Suécia, e vários municípios\n\nda Noruega) mas, também, ao nível supranacional, como na União Europeia, onde o\n\nParlamento Europeu lançou um sistema de petição eletrónica melhorado em novembro de\n\n2014, com vista a substituir o sistema em vigor à data, o qual, embora prevendo algumas\n\nfuncionalidades eletrónicas, era bastante limitado.\n\nQuadro 3.6. Breve resenha da modernização do direito de petição\n\nO Parlamento escocês desempenhou um papel pioneiro na Europa, uma vez que\n\ncriou, em 1999, um sistema de petições baseado em grande parte nos meios eletrónicos.\n\n26 Ostling (2011)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n50\n\nIndependentemente da forma como as petições são submetidas (por e-mail ou por correio\n\npostal), todas as petições são publicados na Internet e o seu exame (processo de tomada de\n\ndecisão) pode ser acompanhado e monitorizado no site do Parlamento escocês.\n\nAs informações mais relevantes relacionadas com a petição estão disponíveis\n\nonline, tal como o número de assinaturas, documentos relacionados com a petição e as atas\n\ndas reuniões em que a petição é discutida. As funcionalidades eletrónicas incluem a\n\npossibilidade de submeter petições ou assinar online petições já submetidas, bem como de\n\nrealizar discussões online sobre as petições.\n\nEmbora não seja obrigatório, a realização de debates e audições aos peticionários\n\nconstituem prática comum, independentemente do número de assinaturas na petição (não\n\nhá limiares), e podem ser vistos na Internet. O site também inclui uma grande variedade de\n\nmaterial de informação, tais como texto, folhetos e vídeos de animação, disponível em\n\nvárias línguas (incluindo árabe, bengali, punjabi, chinês simplificado / mandarim, ou\n\nUrdu), em que se explica ao público o funcionamento do sistema de petições, da submissão\n\ne do seu exame (apreciação) até à decisão final.\n\nEm 2005, o Parlamento alemão (Bundestag), em grande parte inspirado pelo\n\nexemplo escocês, iniciou uma reforma para introduzir funcionalidades relacionadas com a\n\nInternet no sistema de petições.\n\nEsta reforma incluía a possibilidade de as petições serem enviadas por E-mail e,\n\nem certas condições, publicados na Internet os textos de petição (nas chamadas “petições\n\npúblicas”), bem como o respetivo processo.\n\nSe uma petição for aceite pelo Bundestag como “petição pública”, as assinaturas\n\nde apoio à petição podem ser recolhidas na plataforma de petições-E do Bundestag\n\nalemão. Estas petições também podem ser discutidas na Internet, em fóruns públicos. Esta\n\nreforma incluiu também outras características com vista a melhorar o sistema, tais como\n\numa possível audição dos peticionários e um debate público na Comissão das Petições\n\npara petições que atingissem 50.000 assinaturas.\n\nEmbora a maioria desses recursos eletrónicos estejam disponíveis para as \"petições\n\npúblicas\", o Bundestag manteve igualmente em vigor o sistema de petições\n\nconvencionais, que quase não foi afetado por esse processo de modernização (com\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n51\n\nexceção da possibilidade de se submeterem petições por E-mail), nomeadamente quanto à\n\npublicidade, tendo o processo de petições convencionais permanecido, assim, no essencial\n\ncomo não público.\n\nO sistema de petição-E Português foi aprovado em 2003 e implementado na\n\nprática em 2005. Todas as petições, também as apresentadas por correio normal, são\n\npublicadas na Internet. Além do texto da petição, o Parlamento publica vários documentos\n\nrelacionados com o processo de petição (nota admissibilidade, perguntas ao Governo e\n\nrespetivas respostas, relatório final).\n\nNem todos esses documentos foram disponibilizados na Internet quando o novo\n\nsistema de petições-E foi introduzido, mas o Parlamento foi melhorando progressivamente\n\nas funcionalidades disponibilizadas. Os peticionários podem recolher livremente as\n\nassinaturas na Internet, embora não exista uma plataforma do Parlamento especificamente\n\ndedicada a este efeito.\n\nExemplos mais recentes de modernização dos sistemas de petição podem ser\n\nencontrados no Oireachtas irlandês (2012), no Luxemburgo (2014) e no Reino Unido\n\n(2015).\n\nNo caso da Irlanda, as petições podem ser submetidas por meios eletrónicos ou\n\nconvencionais para uma Subcomissão conjunta de Petições composta por membros das\n\nduas câmaras do Parlamento. Detalhes sobre o procedimento (estado, nome do\n\npeticionário e alguns detalhes históricos) são fornecidos na Internet, mas não o texto, nem\n\no relatório final.\n\nO caso recente da Câmara dos Representantes do Luxemburgo prevê, como o\n\nsistema alemão, dois tipos de petições. As “petições ordinárias” e as “petições públicas”.\n\nEstas últimas podem ser debatidas publicamente, com a audição dos peticionários, se a\n\npetição reunir mais de 4.500 assinaturas na plataforma da petição mantida pelo\n\nParlamento. No entanto, todas as petições (“ordinárias” ou “públicas”) são publicadas na\n\nInternet, bem como as informações sobre os desenvolvimentos das petições, formando, no\n\nseu todo, o sistema de petições-E atualmente em vigor no parlamento do Luxemburgo.\n\nO Reino Unido tem um novo sistema de petições (eletrónicas) desde 2015, que se\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n52\n\ndistingue do sistema convencional por estar mais vocacionado para questões nacionais (ao\n\npasso que o convencional pretende ser mais focado em assuntos locais, sendo apenas\n\naceites assinaturas escritas, carecendo do patrocínio de um membro do Parlamento). Este\n\nsistema foi introduzido com o objetivo de revitalizar este instituto, que há muito revelava\n\num declínio assinalável. Em apenas um ano de existência, foram submetidas no novo\n\nsistema de petições-E mais de 18.000 petições. Com este sistema, foi criada uma\n\nComissão de Petições (previamente inexistente). As novas regras estabelecem um limiar\n\nde 100.000 assinaturas para que a petição seja considerada para um debate. Com 10.000\n\nassinaturas, a petição recebe, obrigatoriamente, uma resposta do Governo. A Comissão\n\ntem garantido um maior envolvimento com os cidadãos através do recurso frequente a\n\ninfografias, vídeos promocionais, discussões nas redes sociais (Twitter) e da notificação de\n\ntodos os signatários acerca dos desenvolvimentos da petição, alargando deste modo o\n\nuniverso de envolvidos com o processo da petição, para além da tradicional comunicação\n\napenas com os primeiros peticionários (normalmente os autores da petição).\n\nEstas reformas trouxeram uma nova visibilidade a esta histórica ferramenta de\n\nparticipação, que se traduziu, desde então, em muitos casos, num crescimento no número de\n\nsubmissões (como no Parlamento Europeu ou em Portugal), colocando maior pressão sobre o\n\ntratamento de petições pelos parlamentos e Governos por esta via demandados. É ainda de\n\nrealçar que esta tendência parece de certo modo ocorrer em contraciclo com o contexto de\n\ncrise económica que se vive em meados da segunda década deste milénio, que tem levado à\n\nerosão dos níveis de confiança dos cidadãos nas estruturas políticas existentes.\n\nApesar destes recentes esforços de revitalização, ainda faltam informações completas\n\nsobre os sistemas de petições nos parlamentos da Europa, nomeadamente em termos de\n\navaliação do sucesso ou insucesso destes esforços. É disto que começamos a tratar já de\n\nseguida, na Parte II deste trabalho.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n53\n\nPARTE II\n\n4. A avaliação da eficácia do direito de petição\n\n4.1. Enquadramento analítico da avaliação\n\nNão obstante o direito de petição se encontrar disseminado nos ordenamentos jurídicos\n\neuropeus, especialmente desde a difusão do constitucionalismo liberal de finais do século XVIII,\n\nbem como do esforço revitalizador em vários parlamentos europeus desde os anos 90 e, em\n\nparticular, desde o virar do século, ainda existe uma carência significativa de informação quanto\n\nao cumprimento dos seus objetivos, nomeadamente em termos de avaliação do (in)sucesso\n\ndestes esforços.\n\nCom efeito, houve durante muitos anos \"um impressionante contraste entre a quantidade\n\nde tempo, dinheiro e energia que os Governos de países da OCDE investem a envolver os\n\ncidadãos e a sociedade civil na tomada de decisões públicas e a atenção que prestam a avaliar a\n\neficácia de tais esforços\" (OCDE 2005).\n\nOs anos mais recentes mostram, porém, um interesse crescente pelos sistemas de\n\npetições em geral, com alguns estudos a cobrir importantes aspetos acerca do impacto das\n\nfuncionalidades eletrónicas.\n\nO primeiro grande contributo para uma avaliação e análise empírica das petições\n\nparlamentares foi o já citado estudo coordenado por Marilia Allen Crespo (2001), comparando\n\nos diferentes enquadramentos legais dos sistemas de petições da União Europeia. No entanto,\n\nquando este estudo foi realizado ainda não existia nenhum dos sistemas de petições eletrónicas\n\nque, entretanto, se difundiram, tendo, por isso, escapado à sua análise. Sobre a primeira destas\n\nexperiências, no Parlamento escocês, destaca-.se o trabalho de Carman (2006). Mais\n\nrecentemente, podemos encontrar os trabalhos de Bochel (2012), no Reino Unido, Tibúrcio\n\n(2010, 2015a), Leston-Bandeira e Tibúrcio (2012) e Fernandes (2013), em Portugal, e Lindner e\n\nRiehm, que estudou o caso alemão (2011). Também começam a emergir estudos comparativos,\n\ncomo o de Hough (2012) e, contemplando uma recolha que cobre todos os parlamentos\n\nnacionais da UE, bem como Noruega e Suíça, Riehm, Böhle e Lindner (2014) e Tibúrcio\n\n(2015b, 2016), também com foco nos sistemas europeus.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n54\n\nA eficácia não é uma qualidade objetivamente verificável (como o tempo ou a distância),\n\no que não significa, naturalmente, que não seja mensurável. A literatura oferece algumas\n\ndefinições de eficácia na participação política, que podemos encontrar em Rowe e Frewer\n\n(2004), que fazem uma recensão das principais. Estes autores sublinham, no entanto, a\n\nimportância \"dos casos em que as definições são usadas em avaliações empíricas, na medida em\n\nque isto requer a operacionalização da definição”, ou seja, o desenvolvimento de instrumentos\n\nou processos que permitam medir a realização dos critérios de eficácia, que é precisamente o\n\nque fazemos no final deste capítulo e no próximo.\n\nExistem vários estudos relatados na literatura acerca de avaliações da eficácia, da\n\nparticipação pública nas políticas públicas em vários domínios (na área do ambiente,\n\ntransportes, biotecnologia, etc.). Os critérios são muitos e variados. Uma análise abrangente\n\ndestes estudos pode ser encontrada em Chess e Purcell (1999) e Rowe e Frewer (2004). No\n\nentanto, são poucos os estudos que contemplem uma avaliação estruturada (não subjetiva) da\n\neficácia de formas de participação dos cidadãos (Rowe e Frewer 2000, 2004).\n\nWebler (1995) propõe um quadro normativo de avaliação de participação pública assente\n\nem duas dimensões relevantes: a \"justiça\" (avaliando em que medida esta é percecionada pelo\n\npúblico como justo e democrático) e \"competência\" (avaliando em que medida as conclusões\n\nforam tiradas de uma forma eficaz).\n\nA proposta de Rowe e Frewer (2000), posteriormente atualizada pelos autores (2004),\n\napresenta um quadro de avaliação constituído por duas categorias de critérios de avaliação. Por\n\num lado, os critérios de “aceitação”, relacionados com a aceitação do processo pelo público, por\n\noutro, critérios relativos ao “processo”, associados à sua concretização.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n55\n\nQuadro 4.1. Quadro normativo de avaliação de participação pública (critério da aceitação e do\n\nprocesso)\n\nFonte: Adaptado de Rowe e Frewer (2000)\n\nMacintosh e Whyte (2008) propuseram um dos mais elaborados quadros de avaliação.\n\nEste consistiu numa abordagem holística para a avaliação da participação ao nível local,\n\nsugerindo um modelo com três perspetivas de avaliação: a democrática, a do projeto e a\n\nsociotécnica.\n\nNo fundo, segundo estes autores o modelo deve compreender: i) os principais valores e\n\nprincípios democráticos a que a participação em causa tenta responder; ii) os objetivos de cada\n\niniciativa concreta de participação e em que medida estes foram realizados e iii) em que medida\n\no processo e as ferramentas escolhidas ajudam a realizar os objetivos do projeto e da\n\ndemocracia. Como os autores reconhecem, estas perspetivas são sobreponíveis.\n\nDe acordo com Macintosh e Whyte, a perspetiva do projeto analisa os objetivos\n\nespecíficos do projeto em causa. Sobre os projetos de participação eletrónica, os autores\n\nidentificam cinco critérios principais para a avaliação de um projeto desta natureza, a saber:\n\n1. Envolver-se com um público mais vasto:\n\nUma vez que as iniciativas de Participação-E visam (re)ativar o envolvimento dos\n\ncidadãos em processos democráticos e incluir diferentes perspetivas das partes\n\ninteressadas na tomada de decisões, este critério trata de políticas de informação, com\n\naspetos de inclusividade e com o fortalecimento da comunidade.\n\n2. Obtenção de opiniões mais informadas:\n\nEste critério procura avaliar o impacto da \"informação de base\" sobre o processo de\n\nParticipação-E, nomeadamente sobre o resultado real. Assim, avalia até que ponto os\n\nparticipantes mudam as opiniões e as atitudes devido ao fornecimento de informações.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n56\n\n3. Âmbito de deliberação:\n\nA \"profundidade\" (qualitativa) do processo de Participação-E deliberativa é o foco\n\nprincipal deste critério. Propõe indicadores que permitem a aprendizagem mais\n\ndetalhada sobre os aspetos qualitativos do conteúdo (por exemplo, a extensão da\n\ncomunicação interativa e racional) e a estrutura do processo de Participação-E.\n\n4. Eficácia:\n\nUma vez que se espera que a Participação-E facilite uma poupança de custos e tempo\n\nno campo do envolvimento político dos cidadãos, este critério questiona sobre o\n\nmecanismo adequado para investigar tais assunções (por exemplo, comparações entre\n\nprocessos de participação offline e on-line).\n\n5. Feedback:\n\nEste critério visa avaliar a resposta e feedback recebido pelos participantes acerca dos\n\nseus contributos e o seu impacto nas decisões.\n\nA OCDE (2004) também desenvolveu um quadro de avaliação composto por um conjunto de\n\n\"problemas para a avaliação da participação online\", cada um deles tendo a forma de uma\n\npergunta simples, ulteriormente desdobrada em várias sub-questões:\n\n1. Foi o processo de consulta-E conduzido em consonância com as melhores práticas?\n\n(Pergunta-se aos envolvidos se eles “estão satisfeitos com o processo, avaliar se os\n\nrecursos adequados se encontravam disponíveis para realizar a consulta-E, verificar se\n\no processo seguiu orientações sobre melhores práticas, avaliar se a escolha de uma\n\nferramenta online foi adequada para a consulta”)\n\n2. Os objetivos da consulta e o que era esperado dos cidadãos foi tornado claro?\n\n(Pergunta-se aos envolvidos se eles “entendem o que foi sendo solicitado, avaliar se os\n\ncontributos dos participantes foram adequados”)\n\n3. A consulta atingiu o público-alvo?\n\n(“Avaliar a adequação da promoção da consulta-E, identificar quem são e onde estão\n\nos potenciais participantes, em termos de características demográficas e geográficas”)\n\n4. Foi a informação fornecida apropriada e relevante?\n\n(“Avaliar a facilidade com que os participantes podem aceder à informação, avaliar se\n\nos contributos dos participantes tiveram em conta aquela informação”)\n\n5. Foram os contributos informados e adequados?\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n57\n\n(“Avaliar em que medida os contributos vão ao encontro da questão da consulta,\n\navaliar a facilidade com que os participantes podem aceder aos contributos de outros,\n\nclassificar contributos consoante fornecem informação, fazem perguntas ou sugestões,\n\navaliar em que medida alguns contributos respondem a outros contributos”)\n\n6. Existiu feedback durante e após a consulta?\n\n(“Avaliar se as perguntas são respondidas pelo Governo durante a consulta, avaliar em\n\nque medida os contributos se encontram refletidos nas novas medidas ou na medida\n\nrevista”).\n\n4.1.1. Um instrumento de democracia\n\nTal como Parry observou, “qualquer livro sobre participação política é, também, um\n\nlivro sobre democracia (1992)27. Do mesmo modo, julgamos poder dizer-se que qualquer\n\ninstrumento de participação política é, também, um instrumento de democracia. Ou seja,\n\nprosseguindo os objetivos da democracia.\n\nCom efeito, a conceptualização da participação política, nomeadamente da participação\n\neletrónica, pressupõe a expetativa de um contributo positivo para a democracia. Para avaliar de\n\nque forma e em que medida a prática dos sistemas de petições influencia a qualidade da\n\ndemocracia, é necessário incluir no modelo de avaliação deste direito critérios de democracia.\n\nDiamond e Morlino (2004; 2005) destacam as tensões entre as diferentes dimensões da\n\nqualidade democrática e o perigo de reduzir essa complexidade ao pretender estabelecer\n\nindicadores mensuráveis. Defendendo estes autores que qualquer quadro de avaliação da\n\nqualidade democrática é normativa, tentam capturar as inter-relações e dependências dentro da\n\ndemocracia através de oito dimensões da qualidade democrática. Conforme referem os autores\n\n(2004), estas são dimensões nas quais as democracias variam em qualidade. As primeiras cinco\n\nsão dimensões procedimentais: estado de direito, participação, competição e prestação de contas\n\n(vertical e horizontal). Um outro grupo de duas dimensões substantivas, que incluem as\n\nliberdades cívicas e políticas, bem como a igualdade política. E, finalmente, uma dimensão de\n\nresultados constituída pela capacidade de resposta (responsiveness), ou seja, em que medida as\n\npolíticas refletem as preferências manifestadas pelos cidadãos ao longo do processo político.\n\n27 Apud Martins (2004)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n58\n\nEstas dimensões visam principalmente o fortalecimento da influência dos cidadãos na política e\n\nna tomada de decisões.\n\nSchmitter (2005) aborda o conceito de prestação de contas (accountability), considerado\n\npelo autor como a chave para uma definição mais abrangente da democracia representativa\n\nmoderna. Este conceito é usado para medir a qualidade da governança democrática.\n\nAccountability \"implica uma troca de responsabilidades e sanções políticas entre governantes,\n\nrepresentantes e cidadãos\". Medir a accountability deve referir-se a um conjunto de critérios que\n\ncombinam as principais fases do processo de decisão (dimensão temporal) e os principais\n\nintervenientes (dimensão dos atores).\n\nQuanto aos critérios democráticos neste trabalho, seguimos de perto o estudo de Dalton,\n\nScarrow e Cain (2004) acima resumido, e ancoramo-nos na teoria democrática de Dahl e nos\n\ncinco critérios para uma democracia ideal (2000). Aqueles autores adotaram os critérios de\n\nDahl, utilizando-os não apenas no estrito quadro da democracia representativa (como Dahl, e\n\nmuitos teóricos da democracia, tenderam a fazer), mas também da democracia direta e advocacy\n\ndemocracy, incluindo, assim, outras formas de participação dos cidadãos que podem até\n\nconstituir exercícios mais relevantes em termos de influência sobre as elites políticas. Tal como\n\npoderá ser o caso do direito de petição, um dos instrumentos de participação mais populares da\n\nadvocacy democracy.\n\nRecordamos quais são os cinco critérios democráticos de Dahl:\n\ni. Participação Efetiva - Antes de uma política ser adotada, todos os membros devem ter\n\noportunidades iguais e efetivas de tornar os seus pontos de vista conhecidos dos outros\n\nmembros, bem como de opinar sobre qual deveria ser a política;\n\nii. Igualdade política - Quando as decisões sobre política são feitas, todos os cidadãos\n\ndevem ter oportunidade igual e efetiva de participar;\n\niii. Dentro de limites razoáveis, os cidadãos devem ter oportunidades, iguais e efetivas, de\n\nobter Informação Esclarecida das alternativas políticas relevantes em jogo e suas\n\nprováveis consequências;\n\niv. Controlo da Agenda - Os cidadãos devem ter a oportunidade de decidir como e, se for\n\nsua opção, quais os assuntos que serão colocados na agenda pública;\n\nv. Inclusão/Integração - Com exceções mínimas, a todos, ou pelo menos à grande maioria\n\ndos adultos residentes, deve ser garantido que tenham todos os direitos que decorrem\n\ndos restantes critérios.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n59\n\n4.2. Quadro de avaliação da eficácia proposto\n\n4.2.1. Critério de eficácia adotado: os objetivos do direito de petição\n\nAs propostas acima referidas na revisão da literatura constituem os ombros em cima dos\n\nquais nos colocaremos. De um modo geral, nelas se encontram uma parte importante das\n\ndimensões que importa analisar para avaliar o direito de petição.\n\nDa caracterização do direito de petição acima desenvolvida, resultou, contudo, a\n\nnecessidade de criar um modelo adaptado para o direito de petição, atentas as especificidades\n\ndeste direito, nomeadamente quanto à iniciativa da participação depender (quanto ao timing e\n\nmatéria) em exclusivo do peticionário, nisto se distinguindo da generalidade dos direitos de\n\nparticipação convencionais e institucionais que constituem a base para os estudos acima\n\nreferidos - em que o controlo da iniciativa depende, em exclusivo, dos poderes públicos -, como,\n\npor exemplo, as consultas públicas.\n\nDeste modo, muitas das questões que integram os modelos de avaliação atrás propostos\n\nnão são suscetíveis de transposição para este instrumento de participação, pois colocam um\n\ngrande enfoque na forma como os poderes públicos criam condições para que a participação\n\ndesejada se realize caso a caso (disponibilização da informação, envolvimento do público-alvo,\n\netc.). Com efeito, nestes casos, quando os cidadãos são chamados a participar, os poderes\n\npúblicos já definiram a matéria sobre a qual pretendem intervir (legislar, por ex.) bem como o\n\nmomento de decisão, diferentemente do que se passa com o direito de petição.\n\nTendo isto em atenção, e na ausência de um quadro de avaliação com aplicabilidade às\n\npetições, adotamos um quadro de avaliação que combina os objetivos específicos do direito de\n\npetição com os objetivos da democracia, entendendo-se, assim, “eficácia” como sucesso na\n\nrealização dos objetivos, isto é, a relação entre os objetivos definidos e os resultados\n\nefetivamente encontrados (Capucha et al 1996). Deste modo, iremos medir a eficácia do direito\n\nde petição com base na realização destes objetivos, que reconduzimos aos seguintes:\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n60\n\ni. Feedback e Transparência;\n\nii. Igualdade e inclusão;\n\niii. Envolvimento dos cidadãos na res publica;\n\niv. Debate e influência;\n\nv. Participação / Adesão dos cidadãos;\n\nvi. Informação e prestação de contas.\n\nComo referido, os objetivos identificados do direito de petição refletem também os\n\ncritérios democráticos de Dahl. Assim, o critério da “Informação esclarecida” encontra-se\n\nrefletido no objetivo de “Feedback e Transparência” e de “Informação e prestação de contas”; o\n\nda “Igualdade política” e da “Inclusão/integração” no de “Igualdade e inclusão”; o do “Controlo\n\nda Agenda” no de “Debate e influência” e, finalmente, o da “Participação efetiva” no objetivo\n\nde “Participação / adesão dos cidadãos”.\n\nComo vimos atrás, estes objetivos devem ser compreendidos nos limites deste direito,\n\nque deve constituir o primeiro esteio de qualquer avaliação deste direito. Este direito destina-se\n\na dar uma voz aos cidadãos mas não existe qualquer direito a uma decisão favorável, pelo que\n\nnão deve, assim, este critério ser visto como um objetivo do sistema de petições nem, por\n\nconsequência, um seu parâmetro de eficácia. Por outro lado, o seu alcance deve igualmente ser\n\ncompreendido à luz das competências da entidade a que se dirige - neste caso, o parlamento -,\n\ndestacando-se as suas funções legislativas e de controlo.\n\nAssim, se uma petição solicitar o acolhimento de algo cuja competência é do Governo,\n\nem princípio a petição pretende que o parlamento exerça a sua função de controlo, isto é, por\n\nexemplo, que questione o ministério responsável, que exija respostas, eventualmente que chame\n\no membro do Governo para ser ouvido no parlamento ou que debata a petição. São estes os\n\ncritérios que devem servir de parâmetros de eficácia (no mesmo sentido, ver Bochel 2012).\n\nÉ, portanto, a esta luz (do que o sistema pode oferecer) que devem ser considerados os\n\ncritérios que servem para avaliar a eficácia do direito de petição, e não por meio de critérios que\n\nnão refletem o escopo deste direito, como o do acolhimento da pretensão.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n61\n\n4.2.2. Operacionalização – a eficácia no cumprimento dos objetivos através das características chave dos sistemas de petições\n\nCom vista a saber se os objetivos do direito de petição acima mencionados estão a ser\n\nalcançados, operacionalizámos os critérios que permitem uma avaliação empírica. Estes estão\n\nlistados no Quadro 4.2 e pretendem ser um espelho das principais características que\n\nencontramos nos diversos sistemas de petição europeus.\n\nDeste modo, uma vez identificadas estas características principais poderemos analisar\n\nem que medida é que as mesmas contribuem para a realização dos objetivos dos sistemas de\n\npetições.\n\nEstes critérios foram organizados em dois grupos principais: os que dizem respeito ao\n\nquadro jurídico e institucional (que incluem critérios de petições convencionais e de petições\n\neletrónicas), que é mais rígido e estável; e os que se prendem com a forma como os diferentes\n\nintervenientes deste direito se comportam, grupo mais flexível e dinâmico e que pode mudar\n\nmais facilmente.\n\nAssim, além do enquadramento jurídico-institucional deste direito, importa igualmente\n\natermo-nos, para efeitos de critério, ao comportamento dos seus principais atores. Aos cidadãos,\n\na quem compete o impulso deste exercício – determinando o pedido - e sem o qual este não\n\nexiste. Ao destinatário da petição, ou seja, o Parlamento, para saber como a petição é tratada. Ao\n\nGoverno, que, mesmo não sendo o destinatário direto das petições, é frequentemente a entidade\n\ncom competência para atender ao pedido das petições, sendo, nestes casos, o Parlamento\n\nconvocado para exercer as suas competências de controlo do executivo.\n\nO quadro que propomos é, assim, o que segue, cobrindo as variáveis determinantes que,\n\nno nosso ver, importam para a eficácia deste direito, determinando, assim, a realização dos seus\n\nobjetivos.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n63\n\n5. Análise da eficácia do direito de petição nos parlamentos da UE (mais Escócia e PE)\n\n5.1. Quadro legal e institucional\n\nDe seguida, identificamos as variáveis legais e institucionais determinantes que, no\n\nnosso ver, importam para a eficácia deste direito. Isto quer dizer que deixámos de fora algumas\n\ncaracterísticas frequentemente associadas à eficácia dos sistemas de petições por considerarmos\n\nque a sua existência não determina, por si só, um sistema mais eficaz. É este o caso, por\n\nexemplo, das comissões de petições, ou seja, comissões parlamentares com competências\n\nexclusivas quanto ao tratamento de petições. Em nossa opinião, há vantagens relacionadas com\n\na existência de tais comissões dedicadas, como o facto de conferirem um centro institucional\n\npara o tratamento das petições, mostrando a importância simbólica dada a esta ferramenta\n\nparticipativa, bem como providenciarem pessoal especializado para as tratar. No entanto, estas\n\ntambém apresentam algumas desvantagens. Por exemplo, reuniões menos frequentes (em\n\ncomparação com outras comissões parlamentares permanentes)28 ou um perfil menos saliente\n\ndos parlamentares envolvidos. As desvantagens destas são, aliás, as potenciais vantagens do\n\ntratamento das petições pelas comissões parlamentares competentes na matéria: reuniões mais\n\nfrequentes e um perfil mais notório dos deputados, que podem atrair mais atenção para a\n\npetição. A principal desvantagem é o risco de as petições serem negligenciadas em benefício\n\ndos assuntos correntes da comissão (o que pode levar a atrasos na apreciação da petição). Por\n\nnão se nos afigurar claro o sentido do impacto de uma comissão especializada, não incluímos\n\neste critério no elenco proposto.\n\nNa Quadro 5.1, apresentamos um quadro resumo da análise das principais características\n\ninstitucionais do direito de petição na UE (mais Escócia e PE) consideradas no próximo\n\ncapítulo.\n\n28 A título de exemplo, a Comissão de Petições do Parlamento Europeu reúne apenas uma vez por mês (cfr. Secretariado da Comissão de Petições do PE, em resposta a questionário realizado a 29-05-2015), ao passo que qualquer comissão permanente do Parlamento português reúne, em regra, uma a duas vezes por semana.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n67\n\n5.1.1. Direito a uma resposta\n\nO primeiro critério que o presente estudo considera ser relevante para avaliar a eficácia\n\ndo sistema de petição é a existência de um direito a uma resposta, ou seja, o direito de cada\n\npeticionário obter uma resposta formal assim que a sua petição tiver sido apreciada pelo\n\nParlamento.\n\nO direito a uma resposta é uma conquista dos sistemas de petição modernos e sem o qual\n\neste direito resultaria num \"direito tão vazio como o direito de escrever cartas\", nas palavras de\n\nLaband, renomado jurista alemão do século XIX. É, pois, um critério primordial do direito de\n\npetição.\n\nEmbora esta seja uma característica que se encontra generalizada na maioria dos\n\nsistemas de petição europeus, não é garantido (pela lei ou pela prática) em todos eles, como\n\nacontece, por exemplo, na França, em Malta ou na Itália.\n\n5.1.2. Acesso direto\n\nRelacionado com o anterior critério encontra-se um outro: o do acesso direto por parte\n\ndos cidadãos a este direito. De acordo com este critério, o acesso ao direito de petição verifica se sempre que o seu exercício não está condicionado a qualquer circunstância ou decisão que\n\nnão dependa do peticionário.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n68\n\nA esmagadora maioria dos sistemas europeus (incluindo a Escócia e o PE) garante que\n\nos cidadãos que submetem uma petição têm direito a que esta seja apreciada,\n\nindependentemente de qualquer patrocínio ou intermediação por parte de um deputado, uma das\n\nformas mais comuns de condicionar o acesso direto a este direito. Com efeito, existem sistemas\n\nque exigem este apoio de um membro do Parlamento, como acontece com as petições públicas\n\n(ou em papel) no Reino Unido69, na Grécia, na Áustria70 ou, até 2016, em Malta71. O sistema de\n\npetições-E (“petições públicas”) do parlamento alemão também se enquadra nesta última\n\ncategoria, porquanto condiciona o exercício do direito a uma apreciação discricionária da\n\nComissão de Petições, não tendo o peticionário qualquer garantia de que, verificadas\n\ndeterminadas condições objetivas, a sua petição seja aceite.\n\nEm relação aos objetivos do direito de petição, importa lembrar que Dalton, Scarrow e\n\nCain (2004) consideram que o acesso direto e sem mediação é uma das principais virtudes da\n\nadvocacy democracy, que pode potenciar a “prestação de contas” e a “transparência”. Assim, de\n\nacordo com a análise efetuada constatámos que o direito de resposta e o acesso direto potenciam\n\no \"feedback\", a “participação” e a \"informação e prestação de contas\". Na verdade, os sistemas\n\nque exigem que a petição seja patrocinada por um deputado, ou que condicionam a admissão da\n\npetição a um juízo incerto e imprevisível para o peticionário, acrescentam um elemento\n\ndiscricionário para que a petição seja analisada pelo Parlamento. Isso constrange severamente a\n\nsua eficácia, limitando o seu alcançe enquanto direito (transformando-o num direito \"sob\n\ncondição\").\n\n5.1.3. Informação fornecida aos peticionários\n\nUma outra característica relevante diz respeito à informação fornecida aos peticionários,\n\nnomeadamente quanto aos principais atos do parlamento durante a tramitação da petição, como\n\na admissibilidade/rejeição da petição, perguntas feitas ao Governo, respostas deste ou a decisão\n\nfinal.\n\n69 Embora o novo sistema de petições-E que entrou em vigor em 2015 (que coexiste com o sistema convencional ou de papel) não exija este requisito, bastando seis assinaturas para que a petição possa ser admitida. 70 Na Áustria, as petições (\"iniciativa cidadã\", conforme lhe chama a lei) deve ser submetida através de um membro do Parlamento, a não ser que a petição seja subscrita por pelo menos 500 cidadãos austríacos (§ 100 da Lei Federal sobre as Regras de Procedimento do Parlamento). 71 A recente reforma (de 2016) do direito de petição em Malta parece ter eliminado esta exigência.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n69\n\nAinda que com diferentes intensidades, a informação durante o curso do procedimento é\n\ngarantida aos peticionários na generalidade dos sistemas de petições europeus (Riehm, Böhle e\n\nLindner 2014). É o que resulta tanto dos regulamentos sobre este direito72, como da prática 73.\n\nGarantir que esta informação é fornecida em tempo útil aos peticionários é, por exemplo,\n\nconsiderado uma das tarefas chave da equipa de funcionários da Comissão de Petições do\n\nParlamento escocês74. O Parlamento alemão também garante que os peticionários recebem\n\nalguma desta informação. Contudo, os peticionários não são informados dos documentos\n\nproduzidos durante o processo (como os pedidos de informação solicitados ao Governo e as\n\nrespetivas respostas)75.\n\nA informação fornecida (em tempo útil) durante o processo da petição constitui uma\n\ngarantia de maior feedback, sendo este objetivo visado, e garantido, pela generalidade dos\n\nsistemas de petição aqui analisados (cfr. quadro 5.1).\n\n5.1.4. Titulares do direito de petição\n\nOutra distinção relevante refere-se à titularidade do direito de petição e à sua\n\nabrangência. Também nesta dimensão existem diferentes escolhas possíveis ao nível da\n\narquitetura institucional deste direito, nomeadamente quanto a exigências de condições de\n\nnacionalidade, residência ou idade para que este possa ser exercido.\n\nConforme se pode ver no Quadro 5.1, alguns dos sistemas de petição exigem uma idade\n\nmínima. Outros, restringem este direito ao universo dos cidadãos eleitores. Alguns, admitem que\n\nentidades coletivas possam submeter petições. Outros não.\n\nNo que a este critério diz respeito, sistemas como o escocês distinguem-se pela sua\n\nabertura, por virtualmente qualquer indivíduo ou entidade coletiva poder ser peticionário\n\n(nacionais e não nacionais, mesmo estrangeiros não residentes na Escócia, menores de idade,\n\netc.).\n\n72 V.g. Regra 215(6)(8) e 216(9) do Parlamento Europeu, ou artigo 17.º, n.º4 da Lei do Exercício do Direito de Petição em Portugal (Lei n.º 43/90, de 10 de agosto, com as alterações introduzidas pela Lei n.º 6/93, de 1 de março, Lei n.º 15/2003, de 4 de junho, e Lei n.º 45/2007, de 24 de agosto). 73 De acordo com as informações recolhidas junto do Secretariado da Comissão das Petições do Parlamento Europeu, por exemplo, os peticionários são oficialmente informados da admissibilidade ou inadmissibilidade da petição, pedidos e perguntas ao executivo sobre a petição, respostas a estas questões e decisão final; a mesma informação foi obtida junto do pessoal da Assembleia da República, em Portugal. 74 Cfr. questionário a Anne Peat, realizada (por E-mail) a 28-01-2015. 75 Cfr. questionário a Thomas Saalfeld, realizada (por E-mail) a 20-02-2015.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n70\n\nNo entanto, a maioria dos sistemas considera apenas petições oriundas de indivíduos que\n\nresidam no território (país, região, etc.), como é o caso da Alemanha. Sistemas como o\n\nholandês, o búlgaro, o italiano, o português76 ou o do Reino Unido admitem apenas petições\n\nsubmetidas por cidadãos nacionais. O sistema de petições do Parlamento Europeu, que\n\ncontempla o maior universo de peticionários potencial de todos os sistemas analisados, acolhe\n\num critério de titularidade do direito de petição também bastante abrangente, admitindo, além\n\ndos nacionais dos Estados-Membros, petições de qualquer residente no espaço da UE77,\n\npodendo inclusivamente ser submetidas por menores. Adicionalmente, porém, este ultimo\n\nrequer – segundo o regimento - que a petição suscite uma questão que afete diretamente o\n\npeticionário.\n\nDe um modo geral, as petições de entidades coletivas são aceites, mesmo que nem\n\nsempre tenha sido o caso78. Porém, existem casos, como o do Parlamento Europeu, em que\n\napenas se admitem petições formalmente submetidas por cidadãos. Noutros, existem restrições a\n\nalgumas destas entidades, como acontece no caso alemão, cujo Tribunal Constitucional limitou\n\no uso deste direito por parte das autoridades locais79.\n\nEm relação aos objetivos do direito de petição, consideramos que quanto mais\n\nabrangente for, permitindo inclusivamente a participação de grupos de pessoas por hábito\n\nafastadas dos mecanismos tradicionais de participação política (caso dos estrangeiros, por\n\nexemplo, que não podem, por regra, votar nos países onde residem), mais eficaz será este\n\ndireito, porquanto promotor dos critérios da igualdade e inclusão.\n\n76 De acordo com a legislação portuguesa sobre as petições, todos os indivíduos podem apresentar petições relativas a interesses privados (queixas), mas as petições relativas a interesses gerais só podem ser apresentadas por cidadãos portugueses e, desde 2007, por cidadãos de outros Estados que reconheçam esse direito aos portugueses, em condições de igualdade e reciprocidade, nomeadamente no âmbito da União Europeia e no da Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa. 77 Cfr. Regra 215 (1) do Regimento. 78 Em França, na Revolução Francesa, este tipo de petições era objeto de alguma desconfiança: “Nenhum corpo, nenhuma sociedade, nenhuma comuna, pode exercer o direito de petição sob um nome coletivo” (palavras de Le Chapelier, apud Dubourg-Lavroff (1992). 79 Na Alemanha, a jurisprudência do Tribunal Constitucional Federal considerou que as autarquias locais não podiam exercer o direito de petição. Também em Espanha esta questão tem sido discutida, com a doutrina a defender, maioritariamente, o direito destas entidades exercerem o direito de petição (Tibúrcio 2010).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n71\n\nNesta vertente, e como referido, a Escócia destaca-se por ter o sistema mais inclusivo,\n\nadmitindo petições de qualquer individuo – cidadão nacional ou estrangeiro, residente ou não no\n\nterritório. Nos primeiros seis anos em que o sistema de petições esteve em vigor na Escócia,\n\n2,5% (18) das petições foram apresentadas por não residentes (Carman 2006).\n\nEste foi também o modelo adotado pelo recém implementado sistema de petições\n\nirlandês, inspirado precisamente no exemplo escocês. O direito de petição do parlamento alemão\n\ndestaca-se, também, por ser bastante inclusivo.\n\nÉ de notar que, em relação ao Parlamento Europeu, o Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da\n\nUnião Europeia exige adicionalmente que as petições lidem com \"uma questão que afete\n\ndiretamente o peticionário”80. Esta exigência tem o potencial de limitar o direito de a petição ser\n\nexaminada pelo Parlamento Europeu, pelo menos se for interpretada de forma restritiva, o que\n\nnão tem sido a prática até agora. Na verdade, o equilíbrio decorre das regras de admissibilidade,\n\nque permitem dar sempre o benefício da dúvida ao peticionário. Deve notar-se ainda que esta\n\nexigência não encontra paralelo em nenhum outro dos sistemas de petição parlamentares\n\nanalisados.\n\nA preocupação de inclusão está na origem histórica deste direito, tendo servido para\n\nintegrar parte da população, nomeadamente a que, a dada altura, ficou de fora do direito de\n\nsufrágio (como as mulheres, que só muito mais tarde viriam a ter direito de voto), como é\n\nrealçado por Dubourg-Lavroff (1992) ou Rosanvallon (2000). Julgamos ser este um fim que\n\ncontinua a fazer parte da matriz deste direito (também Canotilho 1995), razão pela qual\n\nconsideramos que a maior abertura em relação aos titulares deste direito contribui para o\n\ncumprimento da \"igualdade\" e da \"inclusão\" do sistema de petições.\n\n5.1.5. Natureza dos interesses prosseguidos\n\nOutra distinção relevante diz respeito à natureza dos interesses perseguidos pelas\n\npetições. A maioria dos sistemas de petições parlamentares na Europa admite tanto petições que\n\nprosseguem o interesse geral como petições que visam interesses particulares. É o caso da\n\nBulgária, da França, do Parlamento Europeu, da Grécia ou de Portugal, por exemplo.\n\n80 Artigo 227 do Tratado e Regra 215(1) do Regimento.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n72\n\nNo entanto, existem sistemas que só aceitam petições relacionadas com as competências\n\nparlamentares típicas, ou seja, petições de interesse geral, como acontece na Escócia,\n\nLuxemburgo, Reino Unido, Itália, Áustria ou a República Checa (Riehm, Böhle e Lindner\n\n2014).\n\nOs Países Baixos preveem dois tipos de petições. As que são reguladas pelo regimento\n\n(verzoekschriften), que não podem enquadrar-se nas competências do Parlamento e, na prática,\n\nconsistem em queixas particulares relacionadas com a ação do Governo. E as que não são\n\nreguladas pelo regimento (Petities), que dizem respeito às políticas públicas, isto é, questões de\n\ninteresse geral, e são tratadas pelas comissões parlamentares (Andeweg 2012). Estas últimas\n\nsão, pelas razões que a seguir expomos, as que se aproximam mais da natureza das petições\n\nmodernas.\n\nQuanto aos objetivos do sistema de petições, consideramos que as petições que\n\nprosseguem o interesse geral potenciam uma resposta mais eficaz dos parlamentos (com\n\nimpacto no feedback), permitindo-lhes exercer as suas principais funções, ou seja, funções\n\nlegislativas e de controlo. As petições de interesse geral também \"envolvem os cidadãos na res\n\npublica\" e aumentam a sua \"influência\" sobre questões de interesse para a comunidade. Na\n\nverdade, aceitar petições que perseguem interesses privados pode ser visto como um resquício\n\nhistórico do original direito de petição, que pedia a graça do soberano sobre um caso particular.\n\nEste não é mais o principal papel desempenhado pelos sistemas de petições, sendo as queixas\n\ndos cidadãos normalmente melhor tratadas pelo Ombudsman ou pelo sistema judicial.\n\nAssim, os sistemas que admitem apenas petições de interesse geral - como na Escócia,\n\nRepública Checa, Alemanha (para \"petições públicas\"), Luxemburgo ou o sistema irlandês garantem, à partida, uma maior eficácia do sistema de petição. Na verdade, esses exemplos\n\nsugerem que a modernização do sistema de petições também se destinou a reforçar o papel e a\n\nutilização das petições de interesse geral.\n\nEm sistemas em que coexistem ambos os tipos petições, a forma como os peticionários\n\noptam por usar este direito (favorecendo as petições de interesse geral ou de natureza particular)\n\nirá determinar a eficácia deste critério (questão que analisamos mais adiante).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n73\n\n5.1.6. Perguntas a entidades externas suscitadas pelas petições\n\nMuitas vezes as petições suscitam questões da competência do Governo, chamando\n\nassim o Parlamento a exercer os seus poderes de fiscalização. Consequentemente, uma das\n\ndiligências mais comuns que podemos encontrar nos diferentes sistemas de petição é o\n\nquestionamento do Governo acerca de assuntos suscitados pelas petições.\n\nAlguns sistemas preveem que as perguntas sejam enviadas para o executivo o mais cedo\n\npossível, como é o caso do sistema de petições da UE, em que a Comissão de Petições envia\n\nmuitas das petições para a Comissão Europeia na fase inicial do procedimento, de forma a\n\nreceber uma primeira tomada de posição deste órgão executivo81, sem prejuízo de a Comissão\n\npoder voltar a ser questionada mais tarde.\n\nA maioria dos sistemas não fornece qualquer prazo legal para o executivo responder. A\n\nComissão Europeia tem um prazo meramente indicativo de resposta (três meses, dependendo da\n\ncomplexidade da questão). Na Alemanha, o prazo é de seis semanas, enquanto em Portugal\n\nexiste um prazo obrigatório de 20 dias.\n\nNo sistema português, algumas comissões parlamentares82 adotaram a prática de\n\ninformar o peticionário assim que uma pergunta é enviada ao Governo, solicitando, ainda, que o\n\npeticionário sugira alguma entidade pertinente para ser ouvida, sugestão normalmente acolhida\n\npela comissão83.\n\nO envio de perguntas ao Governo por parte do parlamento reflete o interesse do\n\nparlamento na apreciação da petição, tornando plausível uma resposta do executivo que, de\n\noutra forma, o peticionário provavelmente nunca obteria. Deste modo reforçando\n\nsignificativamente o “feedback” aos peticionários e a “informação e prestação de contas”.\n\n81 Cfr. Secretariado da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento Europeu, em resposta a questionário realizado a 29-052015). 82 No sistema de petições português, as petições são apreciadas pela comissão parlamentar competente em razão da matéria. 83 Exemplo: Comissão de Educação, Ciência e Cultura da XI legislatura, conforme informação indicada pelos serviços da AR (diretor da DAC, João Amaral).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n74\n\n5.1.7. Audições e debates\n\nAlguns parlamentos promovem um maior envolvimento dos peticionários por via de\n\numa audição presencial dos peticionários no parlamento, onde podem explicar diretamente,\n\npelas suas próprias palavras, o que pretendem com a petição. Outra forma de estimular este\n\nenvolvimento é permitir que os assuntos submetidos pelos peticionários sejam debatidos no\n\nparlamento, em comissão ou, em determinadas condições, em sessão plenária. Esta última\n\npossibilidade encontra-se, na maioria dos sistemas de petições, condicionada a um número\n\nmínimo de assinaturas.\n\n. Na Escócia, as audições e os debates em comissão são prática comum84 (embora não\n\nsejam exigidos por lei) e não há limiar mínimo de assinaturas para determinar se uma petição\n\ndeve ou não ser ouvida e debatida.\n\nEm Portugal, as audições são obrigatórias para todas as petições que tenham reunido\n\nmais de 1.000 assinaturas (nestes casos, os peticionários têm o direito de ser ouvidos). Além\n\ndisso, a prática mais recente mostra que é cada vez mais comum as comissões parlamentares\n\nconvidarem peticionários para apresentarem presencialmente a sua petição, independentemente\n\ndo número de assinaturas85. A lei de petições em Portugal prevê ainda que as petições com mais\n\nde 4.000 assinaturas sejam obrigatoriamente debatidas em plenário.\n\nTanto em Portugal como na Escócia, os deputados colocam com frequência, nas\n\naudições aos peticionários, diretamente questões a estes, reforçando deste modo o feedback do\n\nsistema86.\n\nNo Luxemburgo, as petições que recolham num período de 42 dias mais de 4.500\n\nassinaturas são debatidas em reunião conjunta entre a Comissão das Petições e a comissão\n\nparlamentar competente para a questão suscitada pela petição. A reunião conta com a presença\n\ndo ministro responsável pela matéria em causa, bem como do peticionário (até um máximo de\n\nseis). O debate é transmitido na TV Parlamento.\n\nO Parlamento Europeu também prevê ambas estas possibilidades. Embora ocorra com\n\nalguma frequência, não existe qualquer direito dos peticionários a que isso aconteça, sendo a\n\nComissão de Petições a julgar, caso a caso, a pertinência da audição, bem como do debate.\n\n84 O que pode ser confirmado através da informação que consta do site do Parlamento escocês, bem como pela informação fornecida pela clerk da Comissão de Petições (Anne Peat), cfr. questionário realizado a 28-01-2015. 85 De acordo com informação prestada pelos serviços do Parlamento Português a 14-10-2013, é o caso, na XII Legislatura, da Comissão de Educação e da Comissão de Obras Públicas, tendo ambas decidido ouvir sempre os peticionários, independentemente do número de assinaturas.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n75\n\nO sistema de petições do Bundestag alemão prevê uma audição pública (audição e\n\ndebate na Comissão das Petições) para as petições que cheguem às 50.000 assinaturas. Nestas,\n\nmarcam normalmente presença representantes dos ministérios implicados.\n\nA República Checa também acolhe a possibilidade de audições e um debate público em\n\ncomissão, se uma petição atingir o limiar de 10.000 assinaturas. Na Eslováquia, o plenário\n\ndebate petições com mais de 100.000 assinaturas.\n\nNo recém modernizado sistema de petições-E britânico, as petições que recolham mais\n\nde 100.000 assinaturas são consideradas (pela Comissão de Petições) para serem discutidas em\n\nsessão de debate em Westminster Hall87.\n\nQuadro 5.2.

Fonte: elaboração própria, a partir da legislação respetiva (identificada no Quadro 3.4)\n\nEm termos de cumprimento dos objetivos do direito de petição, uma participação mais\n\nativa88 dos peticionários através de audições no Parlamento aumenta \"o envolvimento dos\n\ncidadãos com assuntos públicos\", bem como promove o \"debate e a influência\" dos\n\npeticionários.\n\nOs objetivos de um maior \"feedback\", \"debate e influência\", “informação e\n\naccountability” e do “envolvimento na res publica” dos cidadãos também são fortemente\n\n86 Cfr. Anne Peat, em resposta ao questionário. 87 Os debates de Westminster Hall dão aos Deputados a oportunidade de suscitar questões de âmbito local ou nacional e de receber uma resposta de um ministro do Governo. 88 Seguimos a distinção de Fung (2006) entre participação \"ativa\" e \"passiva\".\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n76\n\nreforçados sempre que os sistemas de petição permitem um debate parlamentar, em particular\n\nem sessão plenária, simbolicamente um dos palcos mais importantes da atividade parlamentar.\n\nNa Escócia e na UE, os membros do Governo ou representantes do executivo participam\n\nfrequentemente nas reuniões das comissões e os peticionários são convidados a participar,\n\npodendo colocar diretamente89 questões àqueles, o que acontece frequentemente90.\n\nNo Parlamento Europeu, estão sempre presentes nas reuniões da Comissão de Petições\n\nfuncionários da Comissão Europeia, que transmitem, assim, a posição deste órgão acerca das\n\npetições em exame. Além disso, os comissários são normalmente convidados uma vez por ano\n\npara intervir na Comissão de Petições para debater questões específicas e genéricas sobre as\n\npetições e o sistema de petições91. Este é também o caso do Luxemburgo, embora aqui ocorra\n\ncom menos frequência.\n\nExemplos como os relatados contribuem grandemente para aumentar não só o \"debate e\n\ninfluência\" e o \"envolvimento dos cidadãos\", mas também \"a informação e prestação de contas\"\n\ndas autoridades públicas.\n\nQuanto aos limiares, e na medida em que introduzem um obstáculo no acesso à audição\n\ne ao debate, condicionam a realização daqueles objetivos prosseguidos pelo direito de petição.\n\nEste condicionamento é, naturalmente, tanto mais forte quanto a sua fasquia for mais alta.\n\nParece ser este o caso do limite mínimo de 50.000 assinaturas exigido pela Comissão das\n\nPetições do parlamento alemão para organizar uma audição pública, o que - em consequência ocorre raramente (Saalfeld e Dobmeier 2012). Entre 2005 e 2010, apenas nove petições públicas\n\nlograram atingir este limiar através da plataforma eletrónica, o que deve ser conseguido no\n\nespaço de seis meses (Riehm, Bohle e Lindner 2014).\n\nA falta de limiares na Escócia e no Parlamento Europeu, ou os baixos limiares em\n\nPortugal, promovem a eficácia destes sistemas de petição nos critérios mencionados. O\n\nLuxemburgo também tem um baixo limiar, embora represente uma percentagem\n\nconsideravelmente maior da população (0,86% de sua população, em comparação com 0,04%\n\nem Portugal, 0,06% na Alemanha ou 0,1% na República Checa), o que tornará a recolha de\n\nassinaturas mais onerosa, como parece estar a acontecer, com muito poucas petições a atingirem\n\n89 No caso do sistema escocês, o peticionário pode colocar questões ao Governo por escrito mas não diretamente na reunião com o Governo. “Esse é o papel da Comissão de Petições” (Cfr. Anne Peat, em resposta ao questionário referido supra). 90 Cfr. Secretariado da Comissão de Petições do PE, em resposta a questionário realizado a 29-05-2015 91 Idem.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n77\n\no limiar (apenas duas em 100 entre março de 2014 - quando este sistema foi implementado92 - e\n\nmaio de 2015).\n\nOs limiares podem ainda introduzir um risco de desigualdade entre peticionários,\n\nnomeadamente entre os que vivem em zonas com mais população – e onde a recolha de\n\nassinaturas se afigura, à partida, mais facilitada – e os residentes em zonas rurais, onde esta\n\ntarefa pode revelar-se impossível. Foi também com base neste risco que o parlamento escocês\n\noptou por não incluir limiares93.\n\nDito isto, deverá sublinhar-se que os limiares podem também ter efeitos positivos. O\n\nprimeiro é a segurança, permitindo que os peticionários saibam que, se atingirem o limiar\n\nnecessário, uma audição - ou debate - terá de ser realizada, não estando sujeita a qualquer\n\ndecisão, muito menos discricionária. Refira-se, por exemplo, que a possibilidade de se\n\nrealizaram audições públicas existe desde há décadas no sistema alemão, mas só com a\n\nintrodução do limiar de 50.000 assinaturas (em 2005) é que se começaram a realizar com\n\nalguma regularidade (embora estas sejam, globalmente consideradas, ainda raras – apenas 9 em\n\n4 anos). Outro possível efeito positivo é que os limiares constituem um incentivo para partilhar a\n\npetição com a comunidade, com vista à recolha de assinaturas, com os potenciais impactos\n\npositivos sobre outros objetivos dos sistemas de petição (especialmente o \"envolvimento dos\n\ncidadãos na res publica\" e a \"influência\").\n\nAvaliar se um limiar mínimo de assinaturas é razoável deve ter em consideração a\n\npopulação do país, bem como as normas relativas à validade das assinaturas das petições (nome\n\ne assinatura, ou também outros dados, tais como o número de identificação de documentos, etc.)\n\ne, nomeadamente, sobre se as assinaturas podem ser recolhidas na Internet - e de que forma. Na\n\nverdade, enquanto alguns sistemas requerem uma assinatura eletrónica (por exemplo, Letónia),\n\noutros dispõem que as assinaturas são recolhidas numa plataforma própria do parlamento (por\n\nexemplo, o Luxemburgo) e alguns aceitam qualquer assinatura recolhida na Internet (é o caso de\n\nPortugal). Quanto menos restrições para a recolha de assinaturas, maior deverá ser o impacto em\n\ntermos de eficácia. No entanto, é necessário garantir que esta facilidade não se traduz na prática\n\nnum abuso, consumindo recursos importantes do parlamento.\n\n92 Site do Parlamento do Luxemburgo (acedido a 07/06/2015). 93 O relatório do Grupo Consultivo de Coordenação considerou que exigir \"um número determinado de assinaturas pode ser um constrangimento para os indivíduos ou organizações sedeadas em áreas mais remotas. Por exemplo, poderia ser muito mais fácil reunir 10.000 assinaturas em Glasgow do que numa remota aldeia de Highland\" (in Carman 2006).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n78\n\nO número de assinaturas recolhidas por petições dependerá em grande parte dos fatores\n\nacima mencionados relacionados com o reconhecimento de assinaturas, o que deve ser levado\n\nem consideração quando se comparam sistemas.\n\nPetições eletrónicas (petições-E)\n\nUma das dimensões relacionadas com o quadro legal e institucional diz respeito às\n\npetições eletrónicas. Identificamos de seguida as características chave das petições-E nos\n\nsistemas de petições na Europa.

Disponibilização de informação sobre o direito de petição\n\nA maioria dos parlamentos disponibiliza algum tipo de informação sobre o direito de\n\npetição nos respetivos sites (Quadro 5.3). De um modo geral, oferecem informação simples, em\n\nforma de texto, acerca da existência deste direito, o seu enquadramento legal, as condições para\n\no seu exercício e o seu alcance. É o que acontece, por exemplo, no Parlamento português94, na\n\nBélgica95 ou no Luxemburgo96. É também o caso do Parlamento Europeu, que contempla\n\ntambém um destacável com uma lista detalhada de Perguntas e Respostas97. Sistemas como o\n\nescocês, o alemão e o do Reino Unido oferecem suportes alternativos para a divulgação desta\n\ninformação, como vídeos explicativos98, vídeos animados99 100, brochuras-E, permitindo uma\n\nexplicação mais acessível do sistema. Na Escócia, disponibiliza-se, inclusivamente, a\n\ninformação em várias línguas (v.g. mandarim, urdu ou árabe). Na Irlanda, o presidente da\n\ncomissão conjunta de petições101 apresenta o sistema de petições num breve vídeo102.\n\nCom efeito, o acesso à informação sobre o direito de petição não está distribuído de\n\nforma igual entre os membros da sociedade. Conforme mostram Riehm, Böhle e Lindner (2014)\n\nem relação à Alemanha, os cidadãos com menos recursos educacionais e segmentos da\n\npopulação, como os imigrantes, revelam uma particular falta de conhecimento acerca desta\n\nferramenta.\n\nDeste modo, considera-se que a disponibilização de informação sobre o direito de\n\npetição nos sites dos parlamentos, com vista à divulgação de forma acessível deste direito,\n\npodendo chegar a quem dele não tinha conhecimento, contribui fortemente para os objetivos\n\ndeste direito, sobretudo o da “igualdade e inclusão”.\n\n94 http://www.parlamento.pt/EspacoCidadao/Paginas/DireitoPeticao.aspx 95 http://www.lachambre.be/accessible/laChambre_petition.htm 96 http://www.chd.lu/wps/portal/public/!ut/p/b1/jY3NCoJAFEafpSeYO1edGZfXdH6QwhqSnE24kBB03ETPnwUtpb 7dB-dwWGBdwlMpUScXVmI_XO8949xif30_kHcuMvIOkALWghwjS1zUadJbZIV6FYAlfJnQ4cqzy8FONhzX50KBIf_-bAxgoPoNtWo6HCiAzIeFHLxoEhe1vAz_6fojsaJd5YHOYtFa0ewEg0CU8/dl4/d5/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SmtFL1o2XzFJNUFISTAySDBGNjYwSVB IRDk2SzQzS0cz/ 97 https://petiport.secure.europarl.europa.eu/petitions-content/docs/faq/FAQ-en.pdf 98 http://www.parliament.scot/gettinginvolved/petitions/CreateAPetition.aspx 99 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aba_kQu1sB0&feature=youtu.be 100 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGEOraE08Jk\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n80\n\n5.1.9. Submissão de petições (e assinaturas) via E-mail / formulário eletrónico\n\nAo longo da última década, alguns parlamentos adotaram funcionalidades limitadas de\n\npetições-E, nomeadamente ao limitarem-se a aceitar que as petições sejam apresentadas por E mail ou outros meios eletrónicos (como um formulário eletrónico), como foi o caso, entre\n\noutros, da Hungria ou da Eslovénia.\n\nTodavia, ainda existem sistemas de petições que não aceitam petições apresentadas por\n\nvia eletrónica, como a França, Malta, Grécia e Áustria (Riehm, Böhle e Lindner 2014).\n\nNo entanto, a maioria dos Parlamentos na Europa admitem petições apresentadas por\n\nestas novas vias de comunicação, como, por exemplo, o Luxemburgo, a Escócia, a Espanha,\n\nPortugal, a Bélgica ou o Reino Unido. O Parlamento Europeu aceita petições submetidas através\n\nde um formulário eletrónico (mas, em princípio103, não aceita petições submetidas por E-mail),\n\nexigindo o registo do peticionário.\n\nA Internet tem facilitado a apresentação de petições, mas também a recolha de apoio às\n\nmesmas. A este respeito, a principal inovação em sistemas de petição foi o de admitir a recolha\n\nde assinaturas na Internet e, entre estas, as que permitam aos cidadãos expressarem o seu apoio a\n\numa petição (adicionando a sua assinatura), mesmo depois de a petição já ter dado entrada no\n\nParlamento, como é hoje o caso na Alemanha (para as \"petições públicas\"), em Portugal, no\n\nLuxemburgo ou no sistema de petição da UE104.\n\nEm relação aos objetivos do direito de petição, notamos que a mera possibilidade de\n\napresentar petições por meios eletrónicos alarga as possibilidades de utilização deste direito,\n\npodendo atrair cidadãos habitualmente menos propensos à participação política institucional\n\n(especialmente os jovens). Isto pode contribuir para uma maior \"participação\" dos cidadãos\n\natravés deste instituto, bem como para um maior envolvimento na res publica.\n\n101 Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions 102 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PriYNKE8-Mc 103 A apresentação formal de petições ao Parlamento Europeu não inclui a possibilidade de apresentação por correio eletrónico. No entanto, existem petições enviadas por e-mail que são admitidas, embora este procedimento seja desencorajado pelo PE. 104 Esta nova funcionalidade do recém criado PETI portal admite que os cidadãos adicionem ou retirem o apoio a uma petição, de acordo com a Regra 216(4) do Regimento.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n81\n\nTodavia, este recurso não é isento de riscos para a eficácia do sistema de petições,\n\nnomeadamente o risco associado à questão do \"digital divide\", ou seja, sendo o acesso às novas\n\ntecnologias desigual, um aumento da participação por esta via pode traduzir-se numa sobre representação de alguns segmentos da população (por exemplo, dos mais instruídos). É, por\n\nisso, importante estar atento ao que acontece na prática e, principalmente, garantir que se\n\nmantêm as formas mais tradicionais de participação por meio de petição papel, de forma a\n\nmitigar os riscos de desigualdade que podem ocorrer por esta via.\n\n5.1.10. Publicação do texto da petição na Internet\n\nOutra dimensão relevante dos sistemas de petição-E refere-se à publicação das petições\n\nna Internet, independentemente da forma como tenham sido submetidas (meios convencionais,\n\ntais como em papel, ou eletrónicos).\n\nA publicação no site do Parlamento é uma garantia para todas as petições em Portugal105,\n\nEscócia ou Luxemburgo. Na Alemanha, apenas as petições aceites como \"petições públicas\" são\n\npublicadas. No entanto, a maioria dos parlamentos na Europa ainda não fornece o texto das\n\npetições na Internet. No caso da Irlanda e do Parlamento Europeu, apenas um breve resumo da\n\npetição (geralmente não mais do que um parágrafo) é publicado na Internet.\n\n5.1.11. Informação sobre a fase do processo em que se encontra a petição\n\nAlém da publicação do texto da petição, alguns sistemas exigem a publicação na Internet\n\nde informações sobre todo o \"processo de petição\", ou seja, a indicação da fase em que se\n\nencontra a petição (e das fases tramitadas até à data), os possíveis desenvolvimentos e passos\n\nfuturos a serem tomados até à decisão final, bem como as datas relevantes.\n\nAlguns dos sistemas de petição recentemente modernizados fornecem estas informações\n\natravés da Internet, permitindo aos cidadãos monitorizar o processo da petição, como na\n\nEscócia, Portugal, Irlanda e Luxemburgo. O Portal das petições do Parlamento Europeu fornece\n\nalguma informação, embora em termos bastante limitados.\n\n105 Para além destes documentos, o sistema de petições escocês publica as atas da Comissão das Petições, que inclui as audições. O Parlamento português assegura também a publicação de documentos fundamentais e as audições dos peticionários estão a ser disponibilizadas (em suporte áudio) na Internet.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n82\n\n5.1.12. Publicação de documentos produzidos ao longo do processo de petições\n\nOs parlamentos da UE adotaram abordagens diferentes em relação à publicação dos\n\ndocumentos produzidos durante o processo de petição, como perguntas ao Governo e respetivas\n\nrespostas, bem como o relatório / decisão final sobre a petição. Escócia, Portugal, Lituânia,\n\nÁustria e Luxemburgo publicam regularmente estes documentos. No Parlamento Europeu,\n\napesar de o Regimento prever que as principais decisões sejam divulgadas publicamente106, o\n\nPortal das Petições divulga informação em termos muito limitados, faltando nomeadamente a\n\ndecisão final107, documento fundamental.\n\nA publicação da decisão final sobre a petição é, obviamente, um aspeto chave. No\n\nentanto, nenhum destes documentos é publicado na maioria dos parlamentos aqui analisados.\n\nContudo, também se pode considerar relevante a publicação das petições que são\n\nconsideradas inadmissíveis. É o que acontece no parlamento britânico, que publica informação\n\nacerca das petições que acabaram por não ser aceites como tais. A informação inclui o título da\n\npetição, um sumário da mesma e as razões que justificaram a sua inadmissibilidade. É o que\n\nsucede igualmente no caso português, que publica esta informação no site, incluindo o próprio\n\ntexto da petição e a nota que fundamenta a decisão. Apesar da sua política de transparência, esta\n\nnão parece ainda a situação do parlamento escocês, havendo ainda escassa informação publicada\n\nacerca das petições que não foram admitidas (Carman 2006; Comissão de Petições Públicas\n\n2015).\n\nA divulgação pública dos principais documentos tem um impacto relevante no sistema\n\nde petições, nomeadamente em termos de “feedback”, “igualdade e inclusão”, “informação e\n\nprestação de contas”, “debate e influência” e, naturalmente, na “transparência”.\n\n5.1.13. Divulgação através de suportes áudio e vídeo de momentos chave do processo\n\n(audições, debates)\n\nComo referido no ponto 5.1.7, a possibilidade de realização de audições e debates\n\npermite que os peticionários tenham uma participação mais ativa no processo de apreciação das\n\npetições, realçando-se o impacto no critério do \"envolvimento dos cidadãos na res publica\" e no\n\n\"debate e a influência\" dos peticionários.\n\n106 (Regra 217(2))\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n83\n\nContudo, o efeito nestes critérios é significativamente amplificado quando as audições\n\nsão transmitidas para fora dos muros dos parlamentos, seja na televisão (canal do parlamento),\n\nseja através da Internet, como acontece no PE, Escócia ou Portugal. Neste último, por exemplo,\n\na gravação das audições encontra-se cada vez mais frequentemente disponível na Internet, na\n\npágina da respetiva petição, permitindo a sua visualização a qualquer momento.\n\n5.1.14. Funcionalidades eletrónicas para todas as petições\n\nEnquanto na Escócia, Portugal, Luxemburgo e no PE as funcionalidades eletrónicas são\n\numa garantia para todas as petições, outros parlamentos reservam algumas das principais\n\nfuncionalidades apenas para determinado tipo de petições. É o caso da Alemanha, por exemplo,\n\nonde, enquanto as \"petições públicas\" são publicadas na Internet e desfrutam de uma grande\n\nvariedade de funcionalidades de petições-E (estando acessíveis online os textos, os documentos\n\ne o progresso das petições), as \"petições convencionais\" não gozam do mesmo tratamento.\n\nAcresce que os cidadãos não têm o direito de ver as suas \"petições públicas\" aceites e\n\ntratadas pelo Parlamento enquanto tais, uma vez que existe uma avaliação especial de\n\nadmissibilidade (sujeita a um juízo discricionário considerável) para uma petição se qualificar\n\ncomo \"petição pública\". Isso ajuda a explicar o reduzido número de admissões de tais\n\npetições108.\n\n107 Nomeadamente as respostas / decisões finais, que constam das atas das reuniões da comissão; Apesar de ser fornecido um link na página de petição do portal da Internet, esta não parece funcionar (a 05/06/2015). 108 284 (1,7%), em 2006; 243 (1,5%), em 2007; 306 (1,7%), em 2008; 701 (3,7%), em 2009; 559 (3,3%), em 2010 (Riehm, Böle e Lindner 2014)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n84\n\nFinalmente, o sistema será tanto mais eficaz quanto maior for a parte das funcionalidades\n\ndas petições eletrónicas acima referidas garantidas, à partida, a todos os peticionários (pela lei\n\nou pela prática). Os utilizadores do sistema escocês, português, luxemburguês109 ou do PE têm\n\nassegurada (têm o direito) a publicidade conferida pelo sistema de petições eletrónica às suas\n\npetições. Esta garantia contribui para a transparência e igualdade política dos cidadãos. No\n\nentanto, no caso alemão, a incerteza110 em relação à admissibilidade das petições como “petição\n\npública” (em contraste com o que sucede noutros sistemas), bem como o seu reduzido número\n\n(uma pequena minoria)111, enfraquecem o impacto potencial das funcionalidades eletrónicas\n\nneste sistema, afetando negativamente a “transparência” e a “igualdade política” do mesmo.\n\n5.1.15. Fóruns de discussão online\n\nFinalmente, alguns parlamentos criaram \"fóruns públicos\" que permitem uma discussão\n\nonline das petições, abrindo portas a uma participação mais ativa do público em geral. Este tipo\n\nde recursos eletrónicos ainda é raro, podendo ser encontrado apenas na Escócia, na Alemanha –\n\nembora limitado às \"petições públicas\" - ou Luxemburgo.\n\nAs ferramentas de debates online de petições têm um potencial para reforçar a\n\n“participação”, a “inclusão” e o “envolvimento do público” em relação ao sistema de petições.\n\nAo permitir uma discussão online da petição, o sistema ajuda a divulgá-la a um público mais\n\nabrangente, mas também a reunir informações novas, ideias e reações à petição inicial\n\napresentada. No entanto, a prática mostra um retrato com mais nuances desta ferramenta, que\n\nnão parece ser completamente bem-sucedida. Isto pode resultar de uma falta de esclarecimento\n\nsobre o seu papel preciso. Depois de analisar o sistema alemão, Riehm, Böhle e Lindner (2014)\n\nlistaram algumas questões que encerram algumas das dúvidas suscitadas pelas discussões\n\nonline, nomeadamente sobre: \"qual é o propósito dos fóruns de discussão?\", \"quais são as\n\nprincipais partes que deverão contribuir para os fóruns de discussão?\", \"qual o papel que o\n\nBundestag alemão e seus membros desempenham nos fóruns? \", \"a quem são dirigidos os\n\nresultados dos fóruns de discussão?\", \"como são os resultados da discussão integrados no\n\nprocesso de petição?\", \"existe alguma análise dos fóruns de discussão?\"112. Segundo aqueles\n\n109 No Luxemburgo, tanto as \"petições públicas\" (pétitions publiques) como as\"petições convencionais\" (pétitions ordinaires) são publicadas no portal da Internet, bem como as diferentes fases da petição e respetivos documentos principais (especialmente a decisão final). 110 A avaliação especial de admissibilidade de uma petição para se qualificar como uma \"petição pública\" é criticada pela sua falta de transparência (Riehm, Böhle e Lindner 2014). 111 Ver supra 112 p. 260\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n85\n\nautores alemães, estas questões não parecem ter sido ponderadas antes da implementação destas\n\nfuncionalidades, tanto na Alemanha, como, segundo referem, no caso escocês.\n\nFinalmente, e tendo em conta os objetivos dos sistemas de petição, deve-se realçar que\n\nmuitas das funcionalidades das petições eletrónicas beneficiam todas as petições,\n\nindependentemente da forma como foram submetidas (em papel ou eletronicamente), o que\n\npromove o critério da \"inclusão\". No entanto, a obrigatoriedade de recolha de assinaturas /\n\napoiantes que tem de ser feita exclusivamente através de um portal da Internet, bem como os\n\ndebates online de petições, excluem cidadãos que não têm acesso aos recursos digitais. E isso\n\npode ter um impacto pernicioso no que diz respeito à \"igualdade” e à “inclusão\".\n\n*\n\nNo campo das petições-E, o maior contributo para a consecução dos objetivos\n\nrelacionados com o direito de petição vem, portanto, a partir de dois critérios principais:\n\npublicação de petições e publicação dos principais elementos do processo de petições.\n\nCom efeito, através desta publicização o sistema de petições passou a estar disponível\n\nnão apenas para o peticionário mas para todos os cidadãos, desdobrando-se, assim, numa\n\nvantagem para o próprio peticionário, que passa a poder partilhar com os restantes membros da\n\ncomunidade os seus pontos de vista (e nos termos por si escolhidos), e também para os cidadãos,\n\nque passam a poder ter acesso às pretensões dos seus concidadãos através das petições,\n\nnomeadamente o seu texto, bem como às diligências tomadas e as eventuais respostas e debates\n\ndo parlamento e do Governo, permitindo um nível de escrutínio público anteriormente\n\ninexistente, nomeadamente por parte dos media.\n\nNesta vertente, as petições-E passaram a integrar o sistema de petições considerado\n\ncomo um todo, coexistindo e, frequentemente, interagindo com elementos do sistema\n\npreexistentes, que nada têm a ver com as novas tecnologias, intensificando, porém, os seus\n\nefeitos (é o que sucede, por exemplo, quando as audições de peticionários passaram a poder ser\n\nacompanhadas através do site do parlamento, chegando a um público que antes não chegava).\n\nEsta profunda mudança na natureza do sistema de petições aumenta fortemente a\n\nrealização de muitos dos seus objetivos, em especial quanto à sua \"transparência\", \"feedback\",\n\n\"influência\", \"envolvimento dos cidadãos na res publica\" e \"prestação de contas\" (como pode\n\nser visto no Quadro 5.4 que sintetiza este capítulo).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n86\n\nPodemos encontrar exemplos completos destas funcionalidades de petição-E nos\n\nparlamentos da Escócia e Luxemburgo, que publicam os textos das petições e os principais\n\ndocumentos produzidos (notas de admissibilidade, atas das comissões, cartas trocadas com os\n\npeticionários, as perguntas ao Governo, respostas, relatório final / resposta, etc.), bem como\n\ninformações sobre a fase da petição e as datas correspondentes.\n\nTambém no caso português são disponibilizadas estas funcionalidades-E. Convém frisar\n\nque nem todas as funcionalidades foram implementadas imediatamente em 2005, quando o\n\nsistema de petições-E foi introduzido. Este foi um processo gradual, que acabou por beneficiar,\n\naliás, da reforma do Regimento do Parlamento em 2007113, que impõs a disponibilização da\n\ninformação parlamentar em tempo real, estendendo-se, desde modo, às petições114.\n\nComo mencionado, o Bundestag alemão prevê estes recursos, mas apenas para as\n\n\"petições públicas\" (não para as \"petições convencionais\"). O maior risco identificado está\n\nrelacionado com a oferta de funcionalidades que estão acessíveis exclusivamente a quem\n\ndomine as novas tecnologias, como quando se aceitam assinaturas a petições apenas por meios\n\neletrónicos (como parece ser o caso do Luxemburgo), o que tem um impacto negativo no\n\ncritério da “inclusão” destes sistemas, afastando os cidadãos com menos recursos tecnológicos.\n\nDeste modo, parece de destacar também a importância do critério sobre as\n\nfuncionalidades eletrónicas estarem ao serviço de quaisquer petições, independentemente da\n\nforma como foram submetidas ou exercidas. É o caso, por exemplo, de um peticionário\n\nportuguês que nunca tenha acedido a uma página da Internet mas cuja petição (e respetivo\n\nprocesso) será necessariamente publicada no site do Parlamento, beneficiando da publicidade e\n\nescrutínio que daí pode advir. Este critério ajuda, pois, a minorar aquele risco.\n\n113 Para uma perspetiva desenvolvida da reforma do Regimento da Assembleia da República de 2007, ver Filipe (2009) e Seguro (2016). 114 Entrevista a Cláudia Ribeiro (supra)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n87\n\nO Parlamento Europeu configura um exemplo de um sistema que, apesar de oferecer\n\nalgumas destas funcionalidades, ainda o faz de forma bastante incompleta quando comparada\n\ncom os exemplos referidos no parágrafo anterior, ficando, assim, o seu impacto potencial aquém\n\ndaqueles exemplos. No entanto, sistemas como o do Parlamento Europeu oferecem uma\n\nfuncionalidade que é ainda rara no contexto dos sistemas analisadas, que é o de garantir a\n\ncomunicação não apenas com os autores da petição mas com todos os que se envolvem com a\n\npetição através da mera subscrição da mesma, informando-os, por exemplo, da evoluçao da\n\ntramitação da petição115. Por esta via, saem reforçados tanto o “feedback” como o\n\n“envolvimento com os cidadãos”.\n\nDe seguida, apresentamos alguns exemplos que ilustram a forma como a informação\n\nreferida nos parágrafos anteriores se efetiva através dos sites de alguns dos sistemas de petições\n\natrás referidos.\n\n115 Funcionalidade introduzida na modernização do Portal, em 2014.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n94\n\n5.2. O comportamento dos principais atores do direito de petição\n\nOs principais intervenientes do direito de petição são, como vimos, os cidadãos, os\n\nparlamentos e os governos (ou, no sistema de petição da UE, a Comissão Europeia e os Estados Membros). O desenho institucional do sistema de petições por si só não garante um sistema\n\neficaz, embora seja um fator determinante na criação de condições favoráveis para que isso\n\naconteça. No entanto, a forma como os diferentes intervenientes agem na prática tem um grande\n\nimpacto sobre a eficácia do direito de petição. É o que veremos de seguida.\n\nA resposta dos cidadãos\n\n5.2.1. Número de petições\n\nO número de petições submetidas ao parlamento é o primeiro indicador que mede o\n\nenvolvimento dos cidadãos com este instrumento de participação. Neste aspeto, variações\n\nsignificativas no número de participantes têm um impacto direto neste critério. Uma maior\n\nparticipação robustece, naturalmente, a adesão a este direito.\n\nEste número de petições submetidas varia consideravelmente entre os parlamentos em\n\nanálise. A Alemanha chega a receber mais de 17.500 petições por ano116, se considerarmos tanto\n\no sistema convencional como o de “petições públicas”. Escócia e Portugal têm recebido, ao\n\nlongo dos últimos cinco anos, uma média de 88 e 122 petições por ano117, respetivamente. No\n\nentanto, dificilmente se pode considerar eficaz um sistema de petições com um nível\n\nsignificativamente baixo de participação, como acontece no sistema francês (de acordo com os\n\ndados disponíveis118, houve 29 petições submetidas entre 2002 e 2007 – uma média de seis\n\npetições por ano) ou o belga, com uma média de 10 por ano119, mostrando, além disso, uma\n\ntendência decrescente desde a última década120. Pelo contrário, o número de petições\n\napresentadas ao Parlamento Europeu mostra um aumento acentuado na última década121. Tal\n\naumento coincide nomeadamente com a introdução da possibilidade de submeter petições por\n\nvia eletrónica em 2005, experimentando um crescimento exponencial desde então122 123.\n\n116 Dados para o período entre 2006 e 2009 (Riehm, Böhle e Lindner 2014). O número excecional de petições apresentadas ao Bundestag pode ser explicado pelo facto de a Alemanha não ter um Provedor de Justiça nacional e,\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n95\n\nNão obstante, importa ter presente em que medida um aumento da participação dos\n\npeticionários pode afetar os restantes critérios visados pelo direito de petição, pois, como vimos,\n\no preenchimento de um critério pode ser feito em detrimento de outro.\n\nDeste modo, a \"igualdade e a inclusão\" ficarão prejudicadas se entre os peticionários\n\nestiverem desigualmente representados, por exemplo, os cidadãos mais pobres, os jovens, os que\n\ntêm um menor nível de instrução, ou as mulheres. Dito de outro modo, um aumento da\n\nparticipação pode ter um impacto negativo se se traduzir num reforço da representação de\n\npopulações já sobre-representadas, em detrimento de outras, agravando a sua sub-representação.\n\nNa verdade, igualdade de acesso não significa, de modo algum, igualdade de uso. Conforme\n\nsintetiza Tiago Fernandes (2014), “a qualidade da democracia será ampliada na medida em que\n\nforem reduzidas as desigualdades de expressão, participação e organização dos grupos sociais\n\ncom menos recursos”.\n\nComo vimos acima, o facto de haver um critério abrangente na admissão de petições,\n\nincluindo nacionais mas, também, não nacionais, por exemplo, é um fator que beneficia a\n\neficácia do sistema de petições, nomeadamente ao nível igualdade e inclusão. O PE revela um\n\nsistema inclusivo, permitindo que algumas petições tenham sido apresentadas por imigrantes no\n\nespaço da UE (em 2013, 59 petições - 2% do total; em 2014, 42 - 1,5%)124.\n\npor conseguinte, o Parlamento alemão desempenhar, através do seu sistema de petições, um papel comparável ao do Provedor de Justiça, tendo por isso uma elevada taxa de Petições que perseguem interesses individuais, que são as queixas típicas dirigidas ao Provedor de Justiça. 117 Antes de 2006 e de 2011 118 http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/decouvrir-l-assemblee/les-petitions 119 Entre 2007 e 2012 (Relatório de Atividades disponível em https://www.lachambre.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=/publications/annualreport&language=fr&story=20122013.xml&rightmenu=right_publications, consulted at 14/04/2015) 120 33 (2004-2005), 34 (2005-2006), 26 (2006-2007), 18 (2007-2008), 17 (2008-2009), 4 (2009-2010), 12 (20102011), 15 (2012-2013), 9 (2013-2014). 121 1132 (2001), 1601 (2002), 1315 (2003), 1002 (2004), 1016 (2005), 1021 (2006), 1506 (2007), 1886 (2008), 1924 (2009), 1656 (2010), 1414 (2011), 1986 (2012), 2891 (2013), 2714 (2014), de acordo com informação recolhida junto do Secretariado da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento Europeu. 122 Petições submetidas por meios eletrónicos: 154 (2005), 317 (2006), 635 (2007), 1117 (2008), 2714 (2009), 1047 (2010), 815 (2011), 1387 (2012), 2173 (2013), 2174 (2014). 123 Este aumento é maior do que a descida registada em relação às petições convencionais (em papel). 124 Números fornecidos pelo Secretariado da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento Europeu, em junho de 2015.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n96\n\nTrês outras dimensões relacionadas com o comportamento dos cidadãos também devem,\n\nassim, ser levadas em consideração, as quais serão abordadas a seguir (e ainda mais\n\ndesenvolvidamente no capítulo seguinte, quando analisarmos os dados sobre o caso português):\n\ni) a proporção de indivíduos peticionários (cidadãos) versus petições apresentadas por entes\n\ncoletivos - associações, sindicatos, lobbies, empresas, entidades públicas; ii) a natureza dos\n\ninteresses efetivamente visados pelos peticionários (interesse privado ou geral); iii) o perfil\n\nsocioeconómico dos peticionários, em particular em matéria de educação, idade e sexo.\n\n5.2.2. Natureza da sociedade civil mobilizada\n\nComo vimos atrás, a admissão de entidades coletivas como peticionários é\n\ngeneralizadamente aceite. No entanto, é importante que a participação dos cidadãos não se\n\nreduza a uma percentagem marginal. Na verdade, pode haver o risco de o sistema de petições\n\nser capturado por entidades que, à partida, já detêm mais influência na sociedade. Foi o que\n\naconteceu em Portugal, com os sindicatos – onde tinham uma forte tradição de ativismo - a\n\nassumir uma grande proporção do total de petições nos primeiros anos da democracia (Braga da\n\nCruz 1988), um risco que se dissipou claramente desde 1991 (Tibúrcio 2010). De acordo com\n\nCarman (2006), esse receio também existia no início da implementação do sistema de petições\n\nescocês, receio que, no entanto, nunca se materializou, com as petições oriundas de cidadãos a\n\nassumirem desde o início um peso muito significativo (cfr. infra). Também no Luxemburgo\n\npredominam as petições submetidas por indivíduos, especialmente nas petições submetidas\n\neletronicamente (Kies 2016).\n\nEsta situação traduz uma das potenciais fragilidades da advocacy democracy (Dalton,\n\nScarrow e Cain 2004), que é ser desproporcionalmente usada pelos que já têm uma influência\n\nsignificativa na esfera pública, exacerbando a desigualdade do uso deste direito.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n97\n\nUm outro indicador pode fornecer-nos pistas acerca da origem da petição ser de um\n\ncidadão agindo sem qualquer enquadramento do resto da comunidade. Trata-se de saber se a\n\npetição foi submetida apenas com uma assinatura ou, ao invés, com uma pluralidade de\n\nassinaturas. As petições em nome de entidades coletivas tenderão, naturalmente, a ter mais do\n\nque uma assinatura. Atente-se, por exemplo, no caso do sistema de petições do Parlamento\n\nEuropeu, que não admite a submissão de petições por entidades coletivas e cuja proporção de\n\npetições contendo apenas uma assinatura é, na última década, de mais de 90%, sendo, por isso,\n\nraras as petições com mais de uma assinatura (em 2014, estas não representaram mais de 0,4%\n\ndo total de petições125)126.\n\n5.2.3. Natureza dos interesses prosseguidos pelas petições\n\nJá referimos acima considerarmos que as petições que prosseguem o interesse geral\n\npermitem uma resposta mais eficaz. Isto significa que, nos sistemas que admitem ambos os tipos\n\nde petições, estes serão tanto mais eficazes quanto maior for a proporção de petições de\n\ninteresse geral, que garantem uma maior adequação dos pedidos às funções do parlamento,\n\nenquanto que entidades como o Ombudsman ou o poder judicial estão mais habilitadas para\n\nlidar e tratar queixas particulares. É o caso de sistemas como o português ou o da UE127, nos\n\nquais, sendo admitidas petições de ambos os tipos, existe uma clara prevalência das de interesse\n\ngeral.\n\nO facto de as petições prosseguirem o interesse geral não quer dizer que, muitas vezes,\n\nnão tenham um interesse particular na sua base. Têm-no, até, frequentemente. Contudo, os\n\npeticionários mostram muitas vezes saber converter estes interesses em pedidos que visam o\n\ninteresse geral (Tibúrcio 2010). Na Escócia e na Irlanda existe inclusivamente um assessor\n\nparlamentar (o clerk) que ajuda os peticionários a adaptar a sua pretensão às competências do\n\nparlamento.\n\n125 Entre 2001 e 2014, o peso das petições individuais foi, respetivamente, 87,4%, 89,5%, 92,2%, 91,9%, 90,4%, 88,4%, 86,3%, 89,9%, 90,7%, 92,3%, 90,6%, 92,8%, 95,7%, 99,2% (percentagens obtidas a partir dos dados fornecidos pelo Secretariado da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento Europeu). 126 Tendo em conta o potencial de signatários deste sistema, não deixa de surpreender a quase ausência de petições com mais de uma assinatura. 127 Dados recolhidos junto do secretariado da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento Europeu (supra).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n98\n\nNesta perspetiva, o direito de petição tem um efeito análogo ao efeito ao nível da esfera\n\npública identificado por Warren em relação às associações (2004), que consiste na\n\ntransformação de questões privadas ou individuais em questões públicas e políticas,\n\ncontribuindo para um maior envolvimento dos cidadãos na res publica, para o \"debate público\"\n\ne \"inclusão\".\n\n5.2.4. Avaliação dos peticionários\n\nEm relação aos cidadãos, importa como critério de eficácia não apenas a forma como se\n\ncomportam mas a forma como avaliam a sua experiência. Mesmo que o sistema forneça muitas\n\ndas características acima identificadas, a forma como o peticionário perceciona o modo como\n\nfoi tratado pelo Parlamento parece ser crucial para a avaliação da sua experiência. É\n\nprecisamente isto que é sugerido pelo estudo pioneiro de Carman (2006) em relação ao sistema\n\nde petições escocês, onde os peticionários que consideraram o processo mais justo e\n\ntransparente mostraram-se mais satisfeitos com o resultado de suas petições. Além disso, esses\n\npeticionários mostraram não só mais satisfação com o resultado, mas também com o Parlamento\n\ne as instituições políticas nacionais. Isto sugere que este fator é desde logo decisivo para um dos\n\nprincipais objetivos almejados pelo direito de petição: reduzir a clivagem entre os cidadãos e os\n\nseus representantes.\n\nAssim, de acordo com o que é sugerido pelo estudo de Carman e, também, como\n\nveremos mais à frente, com o inquérito que fizemos aos peticionários do sistema português, esta\n\navaliação releva sobretudo, em termos de eficácia, ao nível da avaliação do processo.\n\nNa Parte III, dedicado em particular ao caso português, teremos oportunidade de\n\nconfirmar a validade de algumas destas asserções para o sistema de petições da Assembleia da\n\nRepública, contextualizando-o com o que se passa noutros sistemas, como o escocês e alemão.\n\nA resposta do Governo\n\n5.2.5. Perguntas colocadas ao Governo\n\nA lei e a prática podem diferir e é importante conhecer se o Parlamento e o Governo\n\nusam na prática todas as prerrogativas legais colocadas à sua disposição pelo sistema de petições\n\n(nomeadamente em relação às questões colocadas ao executivo e as respetivas respostas) e se o\n\nfazem em tempo útil.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n99\n\nA eficácia da articulação entre o Parlamento e o Governo (muitas vezes a autoridade\n\ncompetente para tratar e resolver as questões suscitadas pelas petições) pode ser testada através\n\nde três indicadores relevantes:\n\ni) As petições suscitam, com frequência, perguntas do Parlamento ao Governo no\n\nâmbito do processo da petição?\n\nii) A maioria das questões recebe uma resposta do Governo?\n\niii) O Governo responde num tempo razoável?\n\nAs perguntas ao Governo são comuns na Escócia, Holanda, Luxemburgo, Alemanha\n\n(“petições públicas” ou \"convencionais\") ou Portugal. O mesmo acontece no Parlamento\n\nEuropeu, em que a Comissão Europeia é convidada a examinar e manifestar a sua posição sobre\n\nas petições128. Além disso, na Escócia e no Parlamento Europeu os deputados e, no caso deste\n\núltimo, os peticionários, têm frequentemente a oportunidade de questionar diretamente, durante\n\nas reuniões da Comissão de Petições, os membros do Governo / funcionários da Comissão,\n\nsobre as petições examinadas129. Durante essas reuniões, os membros do Governo ou\n\nrepresentantes do Estado-Membro, talvez de uma autoridade regional ou local em causa, são\n\ntambém convidados a participar - e fazem-no frequentemente -, para responder às preocupações\n\ndos peticionários.\n\nRelativamente às respostas do Governo, o impacto destas dispersa-se por vários dos\n\nobjetivos do direito de petição.\n\n128 No sistema de petições da União Europeia, as perguntas para o órgão executivo (a Comissão Europeia) são normalmente enviadas por defeito, logo após a sua admissão. O mesmo se passa em Portugal desde a revisão do Lei de Petições de 2007. 129 Técnicos da Comissão Europeia participam nas reuniões da Comissão de Petições, transmitindo a posição da instituição sobre a petição em análise.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n100\n\nCom efeito, um maior número de perguntas suscitadas, uma maior percentagem de\n\nrespostas dadas pelo Governo e a rapidez com que o faz contribuem significativamente para que\n\nos cidadãos tenham acesso a informação que dificilmente obteriam noutras condições,\n\nnomeadamente a uma posição do Governo acerca de matérias por si determinadas. Por esta\n\nrazão, importa acautelar que as respostas do executivo surjam em tempo útil, de forma a não pôr\n\nem causa a apreciação do parlamento em tempo razoável. É o que acontece hoje no caso\n\nportuguês (Tibúrcio 2015a), apesar de ainda haver muitas perguntas que não obtêm resposta,\n\nperturbando a eficácia deste critério. O Parlamento Europeu também se queixa de as respostas\n\ndo Executivo virem, frequentemente, com atraso considerável, o que afeta naturalmente a\n\npossibilidade de o Parlamento responder em tempo razoável, prejudicando negativamente a\n\neficácia do sistema.\n\nAtravés destes critérios, estão em causa o cumprimento de alguns fins primordiais do\n\ndireito de petição, como o “feedback”, a “igualdade”, a “transparência” ou a “informação e\n\nprestação de contas”.\n\nO preenchimento destes critérios é ainda potenciado se se pensar que, através do sistema\n\nde petições-E (ou seja – recorde-se -, excluindo os sistemas que limitam as funcionalidades-E a\n\npermitir a submissão de petições por via eletrónica), o acesso à informação é extensível a todos\n\nos cidadãos interessados em acompanhar a petição e a sua tramitação através dos documentos\n\nque vão sendo publicados no site do parlamento.\n\nA resposta do Parlamento\n\n5.2.6. Resposta num prazo razoável\n\nAlguns sistemas de petição preveem um prazo para que os Parlamentos deem uma\n\nresposta final sobre a petição. É o caso na Lituânia (90 dias), Portugal (60 dias) ou a República\n\nCheca (30 dias)130. Contudo, a maioria dos Estados-membros, incluindo a UE e a Escócia, não\n\nfornecem qualquer prazo específico para a consideração de petições.\n\n130 Outros sistemas de petição que definem prazos legais para a apreciação das petições são a Eslováquia, a Bulgária e a Grécia.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n101\n\nA celeridade com que o Parlamento aprecia as petições constitui uma inegável medida\n\nda eficácia dos sistemas de petições, podendo uma apreciação excessivamente demorada pôr em\n\ncausa a utilidade da petição. Assim, uma resposta em tempo razoável fortalecerá\n\nsignificativamente o “feedback” aos peticionários, contribuindo para a eficácia da participação.\n\nEmbora inexista uma medida de razoabilidade para o tempo de apreciação de uma petição,\n\nconsideramos que, quando exigido por lei, este período específico pode ser considerado como\n\ntal.\n\nA escassa informação disponível ao nível dos diferentes sistemas de petição não nos\n\npermite estabelecer qualquer relação entre os sistemas que proporcionam uma resposta dentro de\n\num prazo razoável e a existência de um prazo legal. Na Escócia, durante os primeiros anos em\n\nque o sistema esteve em vigor (1999-2005), o tempo médio de apreciação das petições foi de\n\n268 dias (Carman 2006). Em Portugal, o tempo de resposta do Parlamento melhorou\n\nconsideravelmente desde o estabelecimento das petições-E, em 2005, sendo a média no início da\n\nXII legislatura - 2011 -2012 - de 119 dias131, o que sugere que a transparência e publicidade de\n\npetições-E incentivaram um melhor desempenho do Parlamento (e do Governo) a este respeito.\n\nNo entanto, em relação ao comportamento do Parlamento, talvez o mais importante seja\n\na forma como são tratados os peticionários e as suas petições, que o estudo de Carman (2006) e,\n\ntambém, este nosso (cfr. infra), sugere ser crucial para a avaliação das suas experiências,\n\ninfluindo nas avaliações do resultado das petições e, também, na apreciação que fazem do\n\nParlamento. Assim, este fator parece decisivo para um dos principais objetivos almejados pelo\n\ndireito de petição: reduzir a clivagem entre os cidadãos e os seus representantes.\n\n131 Tibúrcio (2015ª).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Propusemos um modelo de avaliação da eficácia do direito de petição assente nos objetivos\n\nprosseguidos por este instrumento de participação. Com vista a saber se os objetivos do\n\ndireito de petição acima mencionados estão a ser alcançados, operacionalizámos os critérios\n\nque permitem uma avaliação empírica, os quais espelham as principais características que\n\nencontramos nos diversos sistemas de petição europeus. Estes critérios foram organizados\n\nem dois grupos: os que dizem respeito ao quadro jurídico e institucional (que incluem\n\ncritérios de petições convencionais e de petições eletrónicas), que é mais rígido e estável; e\n\nos que se prendem com a forma como os diferentes intervenientes deste direito se\n\ncomportam, grupo mais flexível e dinâmico e que pode mudar mais facilmente.\n\nii. Com base no modelo de avaliação proposto, verificámos haver várias ferramentas\n\ninstitucionais que promovem o feedback, a transparência, o envolvimento dos cidadãos na\n\nres publica e a prestação de contas (accountability), das quais merecem destaque as\n\nrelacionadas com as petições-E, em particular a publicação de petições e a publicação dos\n\nprincipais elementos do processo de petições. Com efeito, através desta publicização o\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n103\n\nsistema de petições passou a estar disponível não apenas para o peticionário mas para todos\n\nos cidadãos, permitindo um nível de acompanhamento e de escrutínio público anteriormente\n\ninexistente. Isto traduz-se num impacto significativo em vários dos objetivos do direito de\n\npetição, o que deveria constituir um incentivo à sua generalização pelos vários parlamentos\n\neuropeus, o que ainda não é o caso, apesar dos recém modernizados sistemas do Parlamento\n\nEuropeu, no Luxemburgo, em 2014, e no Reino Unido, em 2015.\n\niii. No entanto, notou-se também um forte contributo para alguns dos objetivos do direito de\n\npetição da parte de características institucionais convencionais, como as audições aos\n\npeticionários e os debates, os quais são potenciados quando associados a funcionalidades\n\neletrónicas.\n\niv. Do lado dos intervenientes no direito de petição, sobressai o impacto que as perguntas feitas\n\nao Governo e respetivas respostas têm em vários dos objetivos deste direito. Estas obrigam o\n\nGoverno a tomar posição sobre a questão concreta suscitada pela petição (de que outra\n\nforma os cidadãos têm um poder análogo?), afigurando-se como uma das principais formas\n\nde carrear informação para o processo das petições, revestindo-se, assim, como um dos seus\n\nprincipais retornos (feedback). Do lado do Parlamento, além de suscitar perguntas ao\n\nGoverno, realça-se a importância de dar uma resposta num prazo razoável aos peticionários.\n\nv. Tal como Dalton, Scarrow e Cain (2004) alertaram genericamente em relação às formas de\n\nadvocacy democracy, o preenchimento de um critério pode ter um impacto negativo nos\n\nrestantes. O maior risco que se identificou foi no critério da igualdade, que pode ficar\n\nprejudicado, sobretudo, se houver uma sub-representação de alguns segmentos da sociedade\n\nna utilização deste direito, nomeadamente daqueles cidadãos tradicionalmente menos\n\nparticipantes (como os mais pobres e os menos instruídos).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n104\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n105\n\nPARTE III\n\n6. O impacto das petições eletrónicas no sistema de petições português\n\nNa parte II tivemos oportunidade de dar conta do enquadramento legal e institucional\n\ndeste direito nos parlamentos da UE (mais Escócia e Parlamento Europeu), evidenciando as\n\nalterações introduzidas pelas funcionalidades eletrónicas. Identificámos de seguida quais os\n\nsistemas que lograram modernizar-se, em particular no dealbar do novo milénio, criando um\n\nsistema de petições eletrónica (petições-E), revitalizando um direito que, desde há várias\n\ndécadas, vinha dando sinais de declínio (Tibúrcio 2010).\n\nDebruçamo-nos agora, nesta parte, em particular sobre o caso português, por constituir\n\num caso privilegiado para o estudo do impacto desta modernização por via das petições-E. Com\n\nefeito, a forma como o sistema de petições do parlamento português se modernizou distingue-o\n\ndos restantes exemplos de modernização consolidados, como o da Escócia e da Alemanha.\n\nEnquanto, no caso português, o sistema se manteve no essencial inalterado, embora passando a\n\nbeneficiar, globalmente, das funcionalidades eletrónicas (nomeadamente quanto à publicidade),\n\no exemplo escocês foi instituído ab initio, não permitindo uma comparação anterior. Por seu\n\nturno, o sistema de petições-E alemão (“petições públicas”), também criado em 2005, instituiu se paralelamente ao sistema de petições convencional, que se manteve em vigor mas sem estar\n\nintegrado em qualquer sistema de petições-E (uma espécie de um direito com dois sistemas).\n\nSendo as funcionalidades eletrónicas integradas em todo o sistema de petições até então\n\nvigente, mantendo-se, em muitos aspetos, o mesmo, o caso português permitirá avaliar em que\n\nmedida o comportamento dos peticionários – e dos restantes atores deste direito - se adaptou a\n\nesta modernização, contextualizando-a com os restantes casos de modernização, nomeadamente\n\ncom os dois grandes exemplos da modernização do direito de petição, a Escócia e a Alemanha.\n\nPara avaliar o impacto das petições-E no sistema português, recorremos ao quadro de\n\navaliação da eficácia acima exposto. Tendo este por referência, constituem variáveis\n\ndeterminantes para a eficácia do direito de petição o enquadramento legal e institucional e o\n\ncomportamento dos principais intervenientes.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n106\n\nJá tivemos acima (capítulo 5) oportunidade de identificar as características institucionais\n\ndo sistema de petições português, cujos principais traços se encontram resumidos no Quadro 5.1\n\n- quadro sinóptico comparativo das características institucionais chave dos sistemas de petição.\n\nContudo, um conhecimento aprofundado do comportamento dos principais\n\nintervenientes (os cidadãos, o Governo e o parlamento) exige a recolha de dados empíricos\n\nconcernentes a cada um destes atores, o que fizemos através da recolha de dados que permitem\n\numa análise das petições deste período, bem como do inquérito realizado aos peticionários que\n\nsubmeteram petições entre 1999 e 2012, cujos detalhes metodológicos se explicaram acima\n\n(capítulo 1.1 – objetivos e aspetos metodológicos).\n\nPassamos então de seguida à análise dos principais atores deste direito. Começamos\n\npelos cidadãos (os peticionários), nomeadamente analisando a forma com têm agido no período\n\nem causa. De seguida, e ainda sobre os cidadãos, debruçamo-nos sobre o perfil dos\n\npeticionários, recorrendo ao inquérito a estes realizado, abrindo portas a análises que até hoje\n\nnão eram possíveis por falta de dados empíricos. Com recurso ao mesmo inquérito, analisamos\n\nas respostas dos peticionários acerca da avaliação deste direito: opinião sobre as suas\n\nexpectativas, o processo e os resultados do exercício do direito de petição. Finalmente,\n\nfechamos esta parte com a análise do comportamento do Governo e, naturalmente, da\n\nAssembleia da República, ator central neste direito e a entidade responsável pelo tratamento das\n\npetições.\n\nEstrutura de análise\n\nA análise de cada um dos indicadores obedece, de um modo geral, à seguinte estrutura:\n\nprimeiro, apresentamos os dados relativos ao sistema em vigor (de petições-E) e, justificando se, estabelece-se um paralelo com a população em geral. De seguida, cotejamos estes dados com\n\nos do sistema anterior (convencional), com vista a avaliar o impacto da modernização deste\n\nsistema. Por fim, procuramos, sempre que possível, contextualizar o caso português com os\n\ncasos mais conhecidos de modernizações análogas, nomeadamente o escocês e o alemão. Com\n\nvista a comparar estas experiências, a análise incidirá apenas sobre os sistemas de petições-E.\n\nNo caso escocês, significa que inclui a totalidade do sistema. No caso alemão, incidirá apenas\n\nsobre o sistema de petições-E em vigor (o sistema de “petições públicas”), deixando, assim, de\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Adesão ao direito de petição\n\nO número de petições submetidas ao Parlamento é o indicador que mede de forma mais\n\nimediata a adesão dos cidadãos a este instrumento. Genericamente, e como vimos, podemos\n\ndizer que quanto maior o número de petições, mais forte será a participação cidadã e,\n\nconsequentemente, mais eficaz será o sistema.\n\nO quadro 6.1 mostra a média de petições submetidas por mês perante a Assembleia da\n\nRepública no atual sistema de petições em vigor de petições-E. Este é um valor em linha com o\n\nque encontramos nos sistemas de petições que se modernizaram, conforme mostramos mais\n\nadiante.\n\nQuadro 6.1.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n108\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nO Quadro 6.1 mostra claramente que nunca se apresentaram tantas petições à\n\nAssembleia da República como no presente sistema de petições-E, que regista uma média de 10\n\npetições/mês, ao passo que no sistema convencional esse valor não ultrapassava as 3\n\npetições/mês.\n\nNa verdade, a adesão a este instituto cresceu significativamente logo em 2005,\n\nprecisamente a altura em que se introduziram as petições eletrónicas, tendo a média de petições\n\ntriplicado em relação aos oito anos anteriores. A legislatura seguinte (a XI) denota uma ligeira\n\ndiminuição, o que poderia supor que ao entusiasmo gerado pelo novo sistema se teria seguido\n\nalgum desinteresse132. Porém, a legislatura que se seguiu (a XII) volta a mostrar uma subida na\n\nadesão a este instrumento, valores que se mantiveram nos anos seguintes, revelando\n\ninclusivamente uma tendência de crescimento133. Tal como já tínhamos tido oportunidade de\n\nsinalizar anteriormente (Tibúrcio 2010, 2015a), a introdução do sistema de petições-E parece ter\n\ncontribuído para um aumento considerável da participação política por via deste instrumento,\n\naumento que se tem consolidado desde 2005.\n\nFigura 6.1. N.º de petições submetidas à Assembleia da República – sistema Convencional Vs.\n\nPetições-E (média por mês)\n\n132 Na verdade, desagregando os dados por sessão legislativa é possível que o tal “entusiasmo” se deveu em grande parte a um surto de petições massa na segunda sessão legislativa da X legislatura. Contudo, mesmo descontando este efeito, esta segunda sessão é a que revela o maior número de petições submetidas. 133 Com efeito, a média de petições apresentadas no total da XII legislatura (até outubro de 2015) foi de 10,60/mês, sendo a média de petições na 1.ª sessão legislativa da XIII (outubro de 2015 a setembro de 2016) de 16,64/mês. Estes valores não foram incluídos no quadro 7.1 de forma a harmonizar o período temporal abrangido em todos os restantes quadros (1999-2012).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

A\n\nevolução da forma como foram submetidas as petições revela a manutenção do número de\n\npetições submetidas de forma convencional e um aumento contínuo das petições submetidas\n\neletronicamente134.\n\nA situação que se verifica com a introdução das petições-E em Portugal – e no PE - é\n\ninteressante, contrastando com o que aconteceu, por exemplo, no caso alemão. Neste, a\n\nintrodução das petições-E não se traduziu num aumento do universo total de peticionários\n\n(incluindo aqui o sistema convencional e o de petições-E, chamado de “petições públicas”), mas\n\nantes numa substituição de peticionários convencionais por peticionários das petições-E. Na\n\nAlemanha, as “petições públicas” registam uma subida até 2010 (com 701 petições), tendo,\n\ndesde então, o número vindo a diminuir, para se situar, em 2015, em 436135.\n\nNo caso escocês, a inexistência deste direito anteriormente a 1999, quando foi criado o\n\nsistema de petições-E do parlamento escocês, inviabiliza, naturalmente, qualquer comparação.\n\nA crescente adesão ao direito de petição perante a Assembleia da República é também\n\nconfirmada pelo número de assinaturas recolhidas pelas petições, o que não é de estranhar, pois\n\no período temporal em que vigora o sistema de petições-E corresponde também a um período de\n\ndesenvolvimento da Internet e da forma como as pessoas se relacionam nesta rede. Referimo nos ao desenvolvimento das redes sociais (entre 2008 e 2015, o número de utilizadores de redes\n\nsociais em Portugal passou de 17,1% para 54,8%136) e à disseminação de sites de recolha de\n\nassinaturas online de petições (como, por exemplo, o Petição Pública137). Esta é uma realidade\n\nque contrasta de certa forma com a situação que se vivia em Portugal poucos anos antes da\n\n134 Cfr. supra. 135 A adesão às petições públicas também podia ser medida através do número de propostas deste tipo de petições, que começou por ser de 761 em 2007, e que foi crescendo até 4039 em 2010. No entanto, apenas uma pequena percentagem destas é admitida enquanto tal, em grande medida devido à ampla margem de apreciação discricionária que a Comissão de Petições tem para este efeito. Deste modo, e tendo em conta a melhor comparação com os sistemas congéneres, optámos por adotar como critério as petições públicas admitidas. 136 Marktest : « Os portugueses e as redes sociais 2016 - Análise sobre o comportamento dos portugueses nas redes sociais e sobre o buzz social de marcas» 137 http://peticaopublica.com/\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n110\n\nintrodução das petições-E, em que uma grande maioria dos cidadãos não tinha acesso à Internet\n\ne o contacto entre os cidadãos e o Parlamento por esta via ainda era raro e considerado com\n\nalguma reserva de parte a parte (Cardoso, Cunha e Nascimento 2003).\n\nFigura 6.2. N.º de assinaturas em petições – sistema Convencional Vs. Petições-E (média por\n\nmês)\n\nFonte: elaboração do autor, a partir da informação recolhida no site do Parlamento\n\nNotas: Sistema Convencional (1999-2005); Petições-E (2005-2012)\n\nImporta ainda assinalar que o crescimento que se verifica em Portugal nos últimos anos\n\nocorre num contexto político e económico (e, também, social) particularmente adverso,\n\ncaracterizado por uma grave crise. Com efeito, a partir do final da década passada começa a\n\navolumar-se o impacto da crise internacional em Portugal, culminando, em 2011, num pedido de\n\nintervenção externa à chamada troika (Fundo Monetário Internacional, Banco Central Europeu e\n\nComissão Europeia). Porém, é possível verificar que a crescente desconfiança dos cidadãos\n\nrelativamente às suas instituições representativas (Pequito, Tsatsanis e Belchior 2015) não\n\nabrandou, antes pelo contrário, a tendência de crescimento do número de petições submetidas à\n\nAssembleia da República. Na XI legislatura (09-11), que coincide com o início e\n\ndesenvolvimento da crise, nota-se ainda um aumento do número médio de assinaturas, valor que\n\ncai ligeiramente na XII legislatura (2011-2012), embora mantendo-se superior ao registado nos\n\nanos que antecedem a crise (Tibúrcio 2015a).\n\nContudo, importaria saber em que medida este aumento da participação afeta os\n\nrestantes critérios (i.e. os objetivos do direito de petição), pois, como refere Dalton, Scarrow e\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n111\n\nCain (2004), a satisfação de um critério pode ser feito em prejuízo de outro. Deste modo, a\n\n\"igualdade\" e a \"inclusão\" – objetivos do direito de petição identificados na Parte II - ficarão\n\nprejudicadas se entre os peticionários estiverem, por exemplo, desigualmente representados um\n\ndos géneros ou os cidadãos com menos recursos sociais (nomeadamente educativos).\n\nCom efeito, o inquérito realizado aos peticionários sugere haver esta desigualdade de\n\nalgumas populações no exercício deste direito (igualdade de acesso continua a não significar, de\n\nmodo algum, igualdade de uso), embora pareça que a introdução das petições-E teve um\n\nimpacto positivo – embora modesto - a este nível, conforme teremos oportunidade de confirmar\n\nmais à frente.\n\nContextualização com o caso da Escócia e da Alemanha\n\nFigura 6.3. Número de petições submetidas em Portugal, na Escócia e na Alemanha (2006 2012)\n\nFonte: Riehm, Böhle e Lindne 2014 (Alemanha); Base de Dados das petições (1999-2012) (Portugal): Comissão de\n\nPetições Públicas do Parlamento escocês 2015 (Escócia).\n\nComo indicador da adesão ao direito de petição em Portugal, na Escócia e na Alemanha,\n\nrecorremos ao número de petições submetidas em cada um destes sistemas entre 2006 e 2012. O\n\nsistema escocês foi aquele que recebeu mais petições por 100,000 habitantes (1,5 petições),\n\nseguido de perto por Portugal (1,2 petições), com sensivelmente o mesmo nível de petições\n\nsubmetidas neste período. Finalmente, suge a Alemanha, com 0,5 petições por 100,000\n\nhabitantes. Isto corresponde a um volume de petições anual de 80, 131 e 437, respetivamente.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n112\n\nEstes dados permitem ver que o sistema de petições-E alemão - que, como vimos,\n\nabrange unicamente as “petições públicas” - é, comparativamente, o sistema com menor adesão.\n\nComo aflorámos acima, esta situação prende-se em grande medida com o elevado número de\n\n“petições públicas” recusadas pela Comissão de Petições, algo que esta pode fazer de forma\n\nconsideravelmente discricionária (ver supra).\n\nEstes valores permitem também colocar em perspetiva a ideia de que um sistema de\n\npetições-E, ao trazer publicidade a um sistema caracterizado pela informalidade, traria um\n\ndilúvio de petições com que os parlamentos dificilmente saberiam lidar. Dificilmente se pode\n\nconsiderar o caso, embora não seja, naturalmente, despiciendo o nível de recursos humanos que\n\nos parlamentos colocam ao dispor deste direito138.\n\n6.1.2. Petições individuais e coletivas\n\nAs petições podem ser distinguidas consoante o modo de ação (individual ou coletivo).\n\nDe um lado, as petições individuais, submetidas apenas com a assinatura do seu autor. De outro,\n\nas petições com uma pluralidade de assinaturas, isto é, petições que têm a assinatura do autor e\n\nde, pelo menos, outro subscritor (petições coletivas).\n\nNa figura 6.5 podemos observar a evolução e o peso das petições individuais e coletivas\n\ndesde 1999 até 2013.\n\nA presença de um número significativo de petições contendo apenas uma assinatura é\n\ninterpretado como um sinal de que, na prática, cada cidadão continua a ter espaço para fazer\n\nouvir a sua voz junto da Assembleia da República, independentemente da sua capacidade de\n\nmobilizar outros cidadãos da comunidade. É o que parece ser atualmente o caso do sistema de\n\npetições-E português.\n\n138 Este é, no entanto, difícil de aferir e comparar, atendendo a que há parlamentos com comissões especialmente dedicadas ao tratamento de petições – como na Escócia – e outras em que o tratamento é feito pela comissão competente na matéria – caso de Portugal. A Alemanha também tem uma Comissão de Petições que se dedica em exclusivo ao tratamento de petições (eletrónicas e convencionais), dotada de meios muito significativos – cerca de 80 funcionários. Porém, como referido, o sistema de petições convencional integra aquilo que, em muitos países, é tratado pelo Ombudsman, que não existe ao nível nacional na Alemanha e cujo papel é em grande medida desempenhado por esta comissão. A Comissão de Petições do Parlamento Europeu conta com o apoio de cerca de 26 funcionários (cfr. resposta a questionário do Secretariado da Comissão de Petições do PE – 29-05-2015).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n113\n\nTodavia, as petições coletivas não deixam de ser um espelho da adesão que a petição\n\nteve na comunidade, distinguindo-se das petições individuais, ou das que não recolhem mais do\n\nque um número reduzido de assinaturas. Isto não quer dizer que este princípio deva ser levado à\n\nletra, que quanto mais assinaturas uma petição tem mais apoiantes na comunidade ela tem. Tal\n\ncomo referido acima, deve ser tida em consideração a existência de quóruns, como acontece no\n\ncaso português, que constituem fortes incentivos a que, uma vez atingidos, as petições sejam\n\nsubmetidas com vista à sua apreciação em tempo útil, dado muitas das vezes as petições estarem\n\nrelacionadas com questões da atualidade.\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nFigura 6.4.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n114\n\nPorém, ao analisarmos com mais detalhe os dados, facilmente confirmamos que, entre\n\n1999 e 2005139, as petições coletivas foram claramente maioritárias. Com a X legislatura, que\n\ntem início em 2005, esta situação altera-se, passando as petições individuais a constituir a\n\nmaioria das petições entradas na AR. No entanto, com o advento da XI legislatura, em 2009, e\n\ndaí em diante, as petições subscritas apenas por um peticionário retomam o seu lugar\n\nminoritário, ainda que com uns expressivos 34 e 33 por cento (na XI e na XII legislatura,\n\nrespetivamente).\n\nFigura 6.5. Evolução das petições individuais e coletivas entre 1999 e 2012 (em %)\n\nFonte: VIII à X legislatura: Tibúrcio (2010a); XI e XII: Site da AR:\n\nhttp://www.parlamento.pt/ActividadeParlamentar/Paginas/Peticoes.aspx (acedido a 20 de junho de 2013).\n\nNotas: Sistema Convencional - 1999-2005 (N=196); Petições-E - 2005-2012 (N=939)\n\nDeste modo, pensamos que o aumento muito significativo de petições individuais na X\n\nlegislatura (05-09) se deveu, em parte, a um surto de petições de massa140 individuais141 e, por\n\noutro lado, a um provável entusiasmo inicial com as petições eletrónicas e com a possibilidade\n\nde apresentar petições por E-mail (introduzido precisamente nesta X legislatura). De qualquer\n\n139 Em verdade, este predomínio remonta, pelo menos, a 1991 (cfr. Tibúrcio 2010). 140 O Regulamento da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento alemão distingue “as petições múltiplas”, que são várias petições com o mesmo objeto, de “petições de massa”, constituídas por um grande número de petições com o mesmo assunto e cujo texto é totalmente, ou em grande medida, idêntico (ponto 2.2). 141 Na X legislatura notámos a existência de 3 petições de massa individuais - que representam 157 petições. A petição que \"Solicita medida legislativa no sentido da atribuição de um subsídio de insularidade aos militares e funcionários civis do Comando da Zona Militar da Madeira (8 petições), a petição que \"Solicita a intervenção do Senhor Presidente da Assembleia da República para que a carreira de vigilante seja reconhecida como \"Carreira\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n115\n\nforma, o certo é que, nas legislaturas seguintes, que coincidem também com o eclodir da crise\n\neconómica e financeira – que teve severas repercussões no caso português -, os peticionários\n\nvoltam a mostrar preferência por uma forma de ação mais coletiva142.\n\nNo nosso entendimento, este indicador mostra haver no sistema de petições português\n\nespaço para estas duas formas de ação (individual e coletiva), sem que nenhuma tenha, na\n\nprática, uma preponderância no sistema de petições, o que beneficia a sua eficácia,\n\nnomeadamente na sua dimensão inclusiva. O que acaba de se dizer é válido tanto para o sistema\n\nconvencional como para o sistema de petições-E.\n\n6.1.3. Petições singulares e petições em nome coletivo (PNC)\n\nAs petições “individuais” e “coletivas”, que se diferenciam em função do número de\n\nassinaturas, não devem ser confundidas com as petições “singulares” e “em nome coletivo”, que\n\nse distinguem pela diferente natureza do peticionário143.\n\nCom efeito, o direito de petição foi configurado como uma forma de participação da\n\nsociedade na res publica, nos assuntos do Estado. Seja dos cidadãos, seja da sociedade civil\n\npropriamente dita ou de todas as entidades coletivas que \"estão fora do aparelho do Estado\"1\n\n(empresas, entidades do terceiro setor, movimentos e comissões informais, etc.). Estas últimas\n\nsão designadas pela Lei de Petições (LDP) como “petições em nome coletivo” (PNC). Para que\n\nse distingam destas, designamos de \"petições singulares\" as petições apresentadas pelos\n\ncidadãos.\n\nOs dados revelam que o sistema acolhe ambos os tipos de petições, sem que as petições\n\ndas entidades coletivas, à partida mais influentes, monopolizem o sistema. Com efeito, as\n\npetições oriundas de cidadãos representam uma maioria significativa do total de petições144.\n\nProfissional de Agente de Segurança Privada Aeroportuária\" (105 petições) e a petição sobre a \"Aplicabilidade do estatuto do trabalhador-estudante aos militares dos quadros permanentes das Forças Armadas\" (41 petições). 142 Esta inversão do peso das petições individuais/coletivas a partir do fim da X legislatura também é notada por Serra (2012). 143 Para uma visão mais desenvolvida desta distinção, ver Tibúrcio (2010 e 2015a). 144 A LDP apenas autonomiza a submissão de petições por “pessoas coletivas legalmente constituídas”, descrevendo-as como as petições “apresentadas por uma pessoa coletiva em representação dos respetivos membros”. No entanto, existe toda uma gama de entidades que, ainda que despersonalizadas do ponto de vista jurídico, são entidades que agem de modo semelhante a uma pessoa coletiva, isto é, visando objetivos determinados e assumidos, em representação dos seus membros. Assim, neste trabalho adopta-se um critério material de PNC, onde cabem, entre outros, movimentos, comissões de utentes e comissões de moradores. Na verdade, estas entidades mais informais representam, desde a VII legislatura (95-99), a maioria das petições classificadas como PNC, representando 30%, 27% e 33% nas X (05-09), XI (09-11) e XII (11-12), respetivamente (Tibúrcio 2015a).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Desde 1991, pouco\n\ndepois da aprovação da primeira LDP, que as petições singulares constituem quase sempre a\n\nmaioria das petições. Contudo, ainda que não maioritárias, as PNC são ainda uma parte\n\nsignificativa das petições apresentadas. Esta situação contrasta com o que acontecia nos\n\nprimeiros dez anos da democracia portuguesa. Até à IV legislatura (85-87), as PNC\n\nrepresentaram quase sempre a maioria das petições apresentadas ao Parlamento (Leston\n\nBandeira e Tibúrcio 2012).\n\nDe acordo com alguns autores, havia mesmo uma captura deste instituto por parte das\n\nentidades coletivas mais influentes, como os sindicatos (Braga da Cruz 1988). No entanto, este\n\nrisco parece claramente dissipar-se a partir de 1991, com a VI legislatura (Tibúrcio 2010).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n117\n\nA situação descrita dos anos 80 pode traduzir aquilo que Dalton, Scarrow e Cain (2004)\n\nconsideram uma das fragilidades da advocacy democracy, que é ser desproporcionalmente usada\n\npelos que já têm uma influência significativa na esfera pública, exacerbando a desigualdade do\n\nuso deste direito. Deste modo, a diminuição do peso das petições de sindicatos, ao mesmo\n\ntempo que acompanhado do aumento das petições singulares, vai, em princípio, no sentido de\n\ncumprir o critério da \"igualdade política\".\n\nNo entanto, estas asserções não devem ser consideradas independentemente do contexto\n\nem que se inserem. Se é verdade que não é desejável uma presença desproporcional destas\n\nentidades no conjunto dos peticionários, exacerbando a sua influência, também é verdade que\n\nestas são porta-vozes de interesses e demandas de cidadãos que, frequentemente, se encontram\n\nsub-representados entre os que exercem este direito, como os cidadãos de menos recursos\n\n(maxime, educativos145), podendo ser, por esta via, um importante fator de “inclusão” e de\n\n“influência” destas populações junto do parlamento. Tiago Fernandes (2014) sintetiza esta ideia,\n\nexplicando que “nas democracias de massas, caracterizadas por amplas desigualdades\n\nestruturais assentes no rendimento, no património, no género, na raça ou na religião, só a\n\ncapacidade de organização coletiva garante a proteção dos cidadãos que compõem as classes\n\nmédias e trabalhadoras. Deste ponto de vista, afigura-se crucial a existência de organizações\n\nsólidas de massas (como sejam sindicatos, cooperativas ou movimentos de mulheres), que\n\nrepresentem os pobres, os excluídos e as maiorias não organizadas, assegurando assim que os\n\ninteresses destes grupos são tidos em consideração pelos Governos e pelas instituições”.\n\nRecorde-se também a relevância dos sindicatos como esteio essencial dos direitos sociais e\n\neconómicos dos cidadãos, “bem como da democratização da partilha e usufruto da riqueza\n\nproduzida, e a redução das desigualdades sociais que lhe está associada” (Freire 2011).\n\nAo longo das últimas duas décadas, nota-se uma diminuição do peso dos sindicatos no\n\ndireito de petição, tanto no seio das PNC, como no total do universo de petições, representando\n\natualmente apenas 7% e 1%, respetivamente, destas petições, o seu valor mais baixo de sempre\n\n(Tibúrcio 2015a). Contudo, diga-se que, na XI legislatura (2009-2011), houve um crescimento\n\nassinalável de petições oriundas de sindicatos. A coincidência com o período de intervenção\n\nexterna ainda poderia fazer supor que este crescimento se ateria com matérias afetadas pela\n\npolítica de austeridade seguida nesse período. No entanto, uma análise às petições apresentadas\n\n145 É, pelo menos em parte, o que acontece no caso português (bem como no escocês ou no alemão), conforme veremos mais adiante.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n118\n\npelos sindicatos mostra que a maioria das pretensões não parecem estar diretamente\n\nrelacionadas a crise146 mas com temas correntes da atividade destas organizações.\n\nDo que se disse, parece retirar-se que a diminuição de petições oriundas de sindicatos\n\nnão pode ser imputável à introdução do sistema de petições-E, embora o aumento das petições\n\nsingulares verificado desde 2005 tenha contribuído para um menor peso das petições destas\n\norganizações.\n\nContextualização com o caso da Escócia e da Alemanha\n\nFigura 6.7.

Jorge Miranda, in Assembleia da República 1995).\n\nO quadro abaixo revela, porém, que, apesar desta dupla função do direito de petição, o\n\nseu uso é primordialmente dirigido às questões de interesse geral.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Como vimos, isto não quer dizer que os textos\n\ndas petições não tenham, muitas vezes, na base um interesse particular. Mostra, porém, que os\n\npeticionários portugueses souberam converter esses interesses em pedidos que visam o interesse\n\ngeral, mesmo não dispondo o sistema português de um clerk (como na Escócia), que tem\n\ntambém o papel de auxiliar o peticionário nesta conversão.\n\nA manutenção dos níveis de petições de interesse geral depois da introdução das\n\npetições-E é ainda de sublinhar por contrariar a nossa expectativa de que um mecanismo\n\ncrescentemente informal e fácil de utilizar (nomeadamente através de E-mail), assim como o\n\naumento das petições singulares na sequência das petições-E, levaria a um aumento das\n\npetições-queixa, que prosseguem interesses particulares. Isto não aconteceu, mesmo num\n\ncontexto de grave crise económica e social (em particular desde 2010), que poderia propiciar\n\neste aumento. Além disso, tendo as queixas ao Provedor de Justiça quadruplicado na sequência\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n121\n\nda crise147, e comungando com estas, em parte, a mesma natureza, poder-se-ia esperar\n\nigualmente um aumento das petições particulares, o que, novamente, não aconteceu. A nosso\n\nver, esta circunstância vem reforçar o enquadramento acima feito quanto à “esfera de ação”\n\ndeste direito. Segundo Martins (2004), da lógica de Lane decorre que quando a motivação da\n\nparticipação é a resolução de interesses específicos e particulares, esperar-se-ia um aumento da\n\nparticipação através deste instrumento sempre que “ocorrem modificações significativas na\n\nestrutura de direitos adquiridos nas mais diversas áreas de atividade que sejam entendidas como\n\nlesivas pelos cidadãos”. Foi o que aconteceu com o direito de queixa (interesses particulares)\n\njunto do Provedor de Justiça, na sequência da crise e da política de austeridade a que Portugal\n\nesteve sujeito desde por volta de 2010. Contudo, não foi o que sucedeu com o direito de petição,\n\no que é consentâneo com o enquadramento das petições como prosseguindo preferencialmente o\n\ninteresse geral.\n\nA utilização do direito de petição para a prossecução privilegiada do interesse geral é,\n\ncomo tivemos oportunidade de desenvolver na parte II, um fator que contribui grandemente para\n\na eficácia do sistema de petições, o que se verifica no caso português tanto antes como depois da\n\nintrodução do sistema de petições-E.\n\nContextualização com o caso da Escócia e da Alemanha\n\nTal como referido, o nosso entendimento é que as petições que prosseguem o interesse\n\npúblico adequam-se melhor às competências dos parlamentos, nomeadamente no âmbito\n\nlegislativo e de controlo do executivo. Deste modo, o sistema escocês, bem como o de “petições\n\npúblicas” do Bundestag alemão, garantem, à partida, a satisfação deste critério. Atendendo ao\n\nelevado peso das petições de interesse geral no sistema português, podemos dizer com\n\nsegurança que este garante a adequação deste direito às principais competências do parlamento.\n\nCom uma possível vantagem a favor do caso português, que é de não recair no cidadão a\n\ndistinção – nem sempre fácil – sobre o que é interesse particular e geral. Deste ponto de vista, o\n\nsistema de dupla função pode ser um fator de inclusão.\n\nNo sistema escocês, este trabalho é muitas vezes feito com a ajuda do clerk da Comissão\n\nde Petições. De acordo com Carman (2006), esta comissão depende largamente dos seus clerks\n\n147 De acordo com o Relatório de Atividades do Provedor de Justiça de 2013\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

O seu papel no sistema de petições passa pelo aconselhamento sobre a\n\nadmissibilidade petição, a interação com os peticionários, a orientação da linguagem da petição,\n\na ajuda ao desenvolvimento de petições, a pesquisa de informação sobre as petições para a\n\nComissão de Petições Públicas, o contacto com peritos externos acerca de questões suscitadas\n\nnas petições, a elaboração de projetos de recomendações sobre as medidas a tomar pela\n\ncomissão, entre outros.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

No entanto, com o advento da XI legislatura, em 2009, e daí em diante, as petições subscritas apenas por um peticionário retomam o seu lugar minoritário, ainda que com uns expressivos 34 e 33 por cento (na XI e na XII legislatura, respetivamente), sendo esta a razão que nos levou a considerar que o impacto a este nível não foi nem positivo nem negativo.\n\nPrincipais ideias a reter\n\ni. Nesta Parte III, começamos por nos debruçar em particular sobre o caso português, por\n\nconstituir um caso privilegiado para o estudo do impacto da modernização por via das\n\npetições-E, por o sistema português se ter mantido, no essencial, inalterado, embora\n\npassando a beneficiar, globalmente, das funcionalidades eletrónicas (nomeadamente\n\nquanto à publicidade), nisto se distinguindo dos restantes exemplos de modernização\n\nconsolidados.\n\nii. O impacto do sistema de petições-E ao nível da adesão dos cidadãos é notório, tendo a\n\nmédia de petições submetidas por mês triplicado em comparação com o sistema anterior.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n124\n\nEsta maior participação dos cidadãos é, também, confirmada pela maior adesão ao nível\n\ndas assinaturas.\n\niii. As formas de advocacy democracy, em que se enquadra o direito de petição, comportam,\n\nde acordo com a literatura, um risco de desigualdade, de serem melhor aproveitadas\n\npelos grupos que já detêm mais influência junto das instituições políticas e que tiram\n\nmais facilmente proveito destas oportunidades de participação. A presença de um\n\nnúmero significativo de petições singulares, com apenas uma assinatura, sugere que o\n\nsistema tem conseguido, na prática, manter-se aberto à participação de todos os tipos de\n\npeticionários, seja qual for a forma de ação (individual e coletiva), sem que nenhum\n\ntenha adquirido preponderância no sistema de petições, beneficiando a eficácia do\n\nsistema, nomeadamente na sua dimensão de “igualdade e inclusão”.\n\niv. Finalmente, apesar da dupla função do direito de petição (para prossecução de um\n\ninteresse particular ou geral), os peticionários têm usado preferencialmente este direito\n\npara prosseguir o interesse geral, convocando diretamente as competências (legislativa\n\nou de controlo) da AR. Assim exercido, o direito de petição torna-se mais eficaz,\n\ngarantindo um maior feedback, promovendo mais debate e influência deste instrumento,\n\nmaior envolvimento dos cidadãos com a res publica e, assim, reforçando, também a\n\nigualdade e inclusão dos cidadãos. Apesar de a percentagem de petições que prosseguem\n\no interesse geral se ter mantido, consideramos que o impacto das petições-E foi positivo,\n\npor ser de esperar que a maior informalidade (nomeadamente podendo submeter-se\n\npetições por E-mail), bem como o aumento das petições singulares no sistema de\n\npetições-E e o recente contexto de crise, levasse a um aumento das petições-queixa, que\n\nprosseguem interesses particulares. Isto não aconteceu.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n125\n\n6.2. Quem são os Peticionários\n\nO presente capítulo utiliza os dados recolhidos pelo inquérito aos peticionários para ter\n\num nível de conhecimento até agora inédito sobre o principal ator deste direito: o cidadão.\n\nDividimo-lo em duas partes: A) a do perfil dos peticionários e B) a da avaliação do sistema de\n\npetições. Em ambos os casos, e tal como fazemos para os restantes indicadores, procuramos\n\ndeterminar qual o impacto que as petições-E tiveram nestas dimensões.\n\nA - Perfil dos peticionários\n\nEste inquérito aos peticionários permite-nos fazer uma caracterização (por género,\n\nsociodemográfica, geográfica, hábitos de participação política, etc.) do perfil dos peticionários,\n\ninformação essencial para respondermos a questões como: estarão os peticionários entre os\n\ncidadãos com mais recursos (v.g. instrução), confirmando o modelo de participação de Milbrath\n\n(1965), ou Verba e Nie (1972)? O uso da Internet abriu este direito a novos grupos da\n\npopulação? Excluiu outros, na linha do que Dalton, Cain e Scarrow (2004) apontaram em\n\nrelação às formas de advocacy democracy, como as petições?\n\nPara efeito de comparar os dados dos peticionários com a população portuguesa,\n\nrecorremos ao inquérito aos cidadãos realizado no âmbito do projeto de investigação de Freire,\n\nViegas e Lisi (2012), através do qual teremos oportunidade de confirmar a nossa expectativa,\n\nisto é, se o perfil dos peticionários replica os preditores da participação institucional de índole\n\npolítica, em termos gerais, ou seja, se são “os indivíduos mais instruídos, mais interessados pela\n\nvida política, situados ideologicamente à direita, e que participam em associações sociais e\n\ncívicas aqueles que maior propensão têm para aderir às formas institucionais de participação\n\npolítica” (Viegas, Teixeira e Amador 2015).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n126\n\nB - Avaliação do sistema de petições\n\nNesta parte, seguimos a proposta tripartida para a avaliação dos peticionários de Carman\n\n(2006): “expectativas”, “processo” e “resultados”.\n\nO enquadramento do direito de petição como um direito a um processo coloca na\n\nprimeira linha a relevância do processo, que é, de certo modo, um fim em si mesmo, na medida\n\nem que proporciona uma parte relevante dos resultados que este sistema pode oferecer. Por isso,\n\na avaliação que os peticionários possam fazer do processo, e da forma como foram tratados no\n\nseu decurso, afigura-se fundamental para compreender a eficácia deste direito.\n\nNo capítulo que se segue (capítulo 7), analisamos ainda, a partir dos resultados do\n\ninquérito aos peticionários, os preditores da avaliação dos peticionários. Na linha da\n\ninvestigação conduzida por Carman sobre o sistema de petições escocês, esperamos que a\n\navaliação do processo determine, em grande medida, a avaliação que os peticionários fazem dos\n\nresultados deste direito.\n\nPor outro lado, consideramos que uma avaliação positiva do sistema de petições (do\n\nprocesso e dos resultados) irá ter uma relação positiva sobre o apoio dos cidadãos ao sistema\n\ncomo um todo e, em particular, à instituição parlamentar. Admitimos ainda que, tal como na\n\nEscócia (Carman 2006, 2010), os resultados do inquérito mostrarão que a avaliação do processo\n\npelos peticionários terá uma relação mais forte com a confiança nas instituições políticas do que\n\na avaliação dos resultados.\n\n*\n\nNa Introdução deste trabalho (capítulo 1.1), tivemos oportunidade de desenvolver os\n\naspetos metodológicos deste inquérito. Deste modo, remetemos para aí os detalhes relacionados\n\ncom estes aspetos.\n\n6.2.1. Origem geográfica\n\nPara obter a origem geográfica dos peticionários, pediu-se no inquérito (pergunta G.17)\n\nque os respondentes indicassem a freguesia e o município (na altura em que apresentaram a\n\npetição). Na pergunta seguinte, solicitou-se que os peticionários assinalassem o distrito/região\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Residente em Portugal (Censos 2011)\n\nA partir da figura 6.9 verificamos haver uma sub-representação significativa da\n\npopulação da região do Norte (NUTS II148) e, em contrapartida, uma sobre-representação ainda\n\nmaior da população da Área Metropolitana de Lisboa149. Neste aspeto, o instituto das petições\n\nconstitui um fator de desigualdade dos cidadãos, beneficiando desproporcionalmente os cidadãos\n\nda região de Lisboa, em detrimento da generalidade das regiões do resto do país.\n\n148 “NUTS é o acrónimo de “Nomenclatura das Unidades Territoriais para Fins Estatísticos”, sistema hierárquico de divisão do território em regiões. Esta nomenclatura foi criada pelo Eurostat no início dos anos 1970, visando a harmonização das estatísticas dos vários países em termos de recolha, compilação e divulgação de estatísticas regionais. A nomenclatura subdivide-se em 3 níveis (NUTS I, NUTS II, NUTS III), definidos de acordo com critérios populacionais, administrativos e geográficos.

De acordo com os dados do inquérito, isto não\n\nparece ter ocorrido, antes pelo contrário, prejudicando o acima referido critério da igualdade e da\n\ninclusão.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Sexo\n\nCom vista a determinar o sexo dos peticionários, o questionário solicitou (pergunta G13)\n\nque estes indicassem o sexo do autor da petição (peticionário), tendo-se, naturalmente, excluído as\n\npetições em nome coletivo150. De acordo com as respostas obtidas, 77% das petições submetidas\n\nno atual sistema em vigor de petições-E foram apresentadas por homens e 23% por mulheres.\n\nFigura 6.11.

Com efeito, o direito de\n\npetição é esmagadoramente exercido por homens, com as mulheres a representarem pouco menos\n\nde um quarto dos peticionários. Este predomínio dos homens não é novidade no âmbito da\n\nparticipação política (Viegas, Teixeira e Amador 2015), particularmente em contextos sociais\n\n150 Cfr. explicado acima, as petições em nome coletivo (PNC) são petições cujo autor é uma entidade coletiva (utilizando-se aqui um conceito material abrangente de entidade coletiva, que inclui, de um modo geral, associações e entidades legalmente constituídas mas também movimentos e comissões informais, isto é, cidadãos a agirem organizadamente).

Ou seja,\n\nas petições-E não tiveram por efeito agravar a representação do sexo no direito de petição.\n\nContudo, também não parece ter conseguido minorá-lo, o que belisca, de alguma forma, nesta\n\ndimensão, o objetivo inclusivo destas reformas, de chamar para a participação por via do direito\n\nde petição cidadãos que antes não recorriam a ele.\n\nAcresce que, apesar de conhecida a maior propensão dos homens para participar na vida\n\npública, alguns autores têm vindo a notar que as diferenças já não são significativas – quer na\n\n151 http://www.publico.pt/sociedade/noticia/elas-ainda-gastam-mais-do-dobro-do-tempo-em-tarefas-domesticas-do que-eles-1714869\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

No entanto, não parece ter sido o que aconteceu no\n\ndireito de petição perante a Assembleia da República.\n\nContextualização com o caso da Escócia e da Alemanha\n\nFigura 6.13.

A população masculina tem sensivelmente o mesmo peso em Portugal, na Escócia e na\n\nAlemanha (48%, 48% e 49%, respetivamente), sendo o seu peso nos peticionários de 74%, 67% e\n\n80%, respetivamente. Assim, ainda que considerável, a Escócia é onde essa desproporção parece\n\nser menor (com a proporção de homens 39% acima da população152), seguida do sistema\n\nportuguês (54%)153 e, finalmente, do da Alemanha (63%)154. No entanto, o teste às proporções\n\npermitiu verificar que as diferenças observadas entre Portugal e os restantes países não são\n\nestatisticamente significativas. Ou seja, a proporção de homens e mulheres que apresentaram\n\npetições em Portugal é semelhante à verificada na Escócia (Z=1,724; p>.05) e na Alemanha (Z= 1,441; p>.05). Porém, é de destacar que, nesta matéria, Portugal ocupa uma posição intermédia,\n\n152 Valor correspondente ao cociente entre as duas proporções. 153 Idem.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Este é, assim, um\n\ndado a reter com interesse, porquanto um dos desígnios destas modernizações é o de atrair\n\npúblicos mais jovens para a participação política, o que parece estar a ser conseguido.\n\nCom efeito, os dados recolhidos no inquérito sugerem que houve um reforço\n\nsignificativo dos peticionários mais jovens (a faixa dos 20 até aos 39 duplicou, tendo passado de\n\n16% para 32%). Ao mesmo tempo, parece notar-se uma diminuição do peso dos peticionários\n\ncom mais idade (60-99 anos), que passaram de 28% para 9,6% do total de peticionários,\n\ndiminuindo significativamente a sua representação.\n\nEsta análise é confirmada se tivermos em conta a média de idades dos que, após 2005,\n\ncontinuaram a submeter petições por carta e dos que passaram a submeter por E-mail. Com\n\nefeito, a média de idades varia consoante a forma de submissão da petição: 49 anos, no caso das\n\nque deram entrada por papel, e 41 anos, no caso das petições submetidas por via eletrónica.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n134\n\nEstes dados parecem apontar no sentido de que a possibilidade de se submeterem\n\npetições por E-mail atraiu grupos mais jovens de cidadãos. Interpretando de outro prisma,\n\ntambém podemos dizer que a manutenção da possibilidade de se submeterem petições por meios\n\nconvencionais constitui uma forma de incluir e manter os cidadãos mais velhos no sistema de\n\npetições.\n\nO peso dos peticionários com idades compreendidas entre os 40-59 anos mantém-se,\n\nsensivelmente, ao mesmo nível.\n\nContextualização com o caso da Escócia e da Alemanha\n\nFigura 6.16. Média de idades em Portugal e Escócia - Peticionários Vs.

Em Portugal, a média\n\nde idades da população é sensivelmente a mesma que na Escócia, estando, porém, a média de\n\nidade dos peticionários apenas ligeiramente acima.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n135\n\nCom vista a contrariar esta circunstância, o parlamento escocês procurou, nos últimos\n\nanos, atrair públicos mais novos e menos participantes, nomeadamente através de campanhas\n\ndestinadas a este público específico. No entanto, este esforço não parece ter-se revelado muito\n\nbem sucedido, com os dados mais recentes a manterem os mesmos níveis de representação de\n\n2006, altura em que o estudo de Carman identificou esta sub-representação dos mais jovens conforme reconhece o estudo da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento escocês (2015).\n\nNo caso da Alemanha, parece ter acontecido o mesmo efeito “rejuvenescedor” do\n\nsistema português, ou seja, os peticionários nos sistemas de petições-E são, em comparação com\n\nos do sistema convencional, bastante mais jovens, conforme figura 6.17. Além da maior\n\nproporção de petições submetidas em Portugal por cidadãos que se situam na faixa dos 40-59\n\nanos, realça-se, no caso alemão, a existência de quase 10% de petições submetidas por jovens\n\ncom menos de 19 anos. É, de facto, entre estes dois grupos (0-19 e 40-49 anos) que se verificam\n\ndiferenças estatisticamente significativas entre Portugal e a Alemanha (Z0-19=-3,685; p<.05 e\n\n(Z40-59=3,388; p<.05). A importância dada a este segmento mais novo da população por parte do\n\nparlamento alemão encontra-se, aliás, espelhada na possível iniciativa de criação de um site de\n\npetições especificamente destinado a este grupo (Riehm, Böhle e Lindner 2014).\n\nFigura 6.17.

Peticionários estreantes\n\nO inquérito começava por perguntar aos peticionários se, “antes de 1999, alguma vez\n\ntinham subscrito, enquanto primeiro signatário, uma petição ao Parlamento?” (pergunta A1).\n\nDe acordo com o inquérito, a maioria dos peticionários no atual sistema de petições-E\n\nexerceu este direito pela primeira vez (90,4%).\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nEste é um dado particularmente interessante quando comparado com o sistema anterior\n\n(convencional), em que o peso de peticionários “repetentes” era significativamente maior\n\n(34,2%) (χ2(1)=16,090; p<.001). Isto constitui um bom indício de que o sistema de petições-E,\n\nnomeadamente a possibilidade de se submeterem petições por E-mail, contribuiu para o\n\nalargamento do universo de peticionários, chegando, possivelmente, a outros públicos.\n\nDe outro ponto de vista, porém, a existência de repetentes pode sugerir que a experiência\n\ncom o exercício deste direito foi bem-sucedida, ao ponto de o peticionário pretender repeti-lo.\n\nEsta é, na verdade, uma possibilidade que não antecipámos a tempo do inquérito, que deveria\n\nconter, assim, uma pergunta sobre se, “tendo em conta a sua experiência, o peticionário voltaria\n\na submeter uma petição”. A resposta a esta questão poderia dar-nos pistas relevantes para a\n\navaliação do sistema de petições.\n\nFigura 6.18.

Ocupação profissional\n\nCom vista a sabermos a ocupação profissional dos inquiridos no momento em que\n\napresentaram a petição, perguntou-se-lhes “qual era, na altura em que apresentou a petição, a\n\nsua condição perante o trabalho?” (G16).\n\nFigura 6.19. Condição perante o trabalho – Peticionários Vs. População portuguesa (em %)\n\nFonte: peticionários: Inquérito aos Peticionários 1999-2012; Inquérito aos Cidadãos Portugueses (Freire, Viegas e Lisi 2012)\n\nNota: peticionários (n=197); População portuguesa (n=1179)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n138\n\nA partir da figura 6.19, que retrata a condição perante o trabalho dos respondentes ao\n\ninquérito, retiramos haver um predomínio muito significativo dos peticionários ativos156, que\n\nconstituem cerca de 82% dos peticionários. Comparando com a população em geral, verifica-se\n\numa representação destes peticionários 90% acima da média do seu peso na população, onde\n\nconstituem cerca de 43% dos cidadãos. Em contraste, por exemplo, com os desempregados ou a\n\npopulação inativa (como os reformados ou os estudantes), que constituem 5% e 13% dos\n\npeticionários, respetivamente, enquanto o seu peso na população portuguesa é de 19% e 37%,\n\nrespetivamente. Assim, estes dois grupos (desempregados e população inativa) encontram-se\n\nclaramente sub-representados. Em todos os casos, as diferenças identificadas entre o grupo de\n\npeticionários e a população portuguesa é estatisticamente significativa (ZAtivos=10,007; p<.05,\n\nZDesempregados=-4.845; p<.05; ZInativos=-6,673; p<.05). Dentro da população inativa, aqueles que se\n\nencontram claramente sub-representados são os reformados, que contabilizam 6,8% dos\n\npeticionários mas cujo peso na população é de quase 28%. Já quanto aos estudantes, estes\n\nparecem refletir o seu peso entre a comunidade (à volta de 5%).\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nFigura 6.20. Condição perante o trabalho dos peticionários – sistema Convencional Vs. Petições-E (em %)\n\nFonte: Inquérito aos Peticionários 1999-2012.\n\nNota: Sistema Convencional - 1999-2005 (n=23); Petições-E - 2005-2012 (n=192)\n\n156Ativo é, de acordo com a classificação do INE, \"um indivíduo que, independentemente da sua idade, no período de referência não podia ser considerado economicamente ativo, isto é, não estava empregado, nem desempregado.\"\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n139\n\nDe acordo com a figura 6.20, com a introdução do sistema de petições-E, parecem\n\nverificar-se algumas alterações no perfil dos peticionários ao nível da condição perante o\n\ntrabalho. Com efeito, regista-se um aumento de 30% dos peticionários ativos (que passou de\n\n65% para 82%) – sugerindo um agravamento da sobre-representação pré-existente deste grupo e uma diminuição do peso dos inativos (de 30% para 13%). No entanto, as diferenças\n\nobservadas entre os dois sistemas não são estatisticamente significativas (χ2(2)=4,918; p>.05), ou\n\nseja, os testes indicam que não existe uma associação entre a condição perante o trabalho e o\n\nsistema de petições utilizado. No entanto, apesar de as diferenças observadas não se terem\n\nrevelado estatisticamente significativas, cumpre referir que, desde a entrada em vigor das\n\npetições-E, e até 2012, a taxa de desemprego duplicou, passando de 7,6% para 15,5157, pelo que\n\npoderia esperar-se um aumento de petições da autoria deste grupo.\n\nContrariamente ao que esperávamos, o aumento de petições que ocorreu com a entrada\n\nem vigor das petições-E não se traduz num aumento significativo do número de jovens\n\nestudantes (embora, como vimos, a média de idade dos peticionários tenha baixado). Deste\n\nmodo, a participação dos estudantes através deste direito parece manter-se, com a introdução\n\ndas Petições-E, proporcional ao seu peso na população portuguesa.\n\nContextualização com o caso da Escócia e da Alemanha\n\nFigura 6.21.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n140\n\nNotas: Portugal (n=192); Escócia (n=368), Alemanha (n=350)\n\nDos três sistemas tidos em consideração, o sistema português é aquele que reflete uma\n\nmaior desigualdade no que diz respeito a este indicador, com um nível de participação no direito\n\nde petição de cidadãos ativos muito acima do peso que representam na sociedade. Esta diferença\n\né estatisticamente significativa, tanto em relação à Escócia (ZAtivos=9,468; p<.05) como à\n\nAlemanha (ZAtivos=4,164; p<.05). Tal como em Portugal, também na Alemanha este grupo\n\nconstitui o principal grupo de peticionários, embora com um peso mais baixo (64,8%). Já no\n\ncaso escocês, a maioria dos peticionários enquadra-se, quanto à situação profissional, na\n\ncategoria de “inativos” (48,6%), contra 39,8% de “ativos”.\n\n6.2.6. Instrução\n\nAos inquiridos foi-lhes perguntado também qual o seu nível de instrução: “Qual o nível\n\nde instrução mais elevado que tinha atingido (na altura em que apresentou a petição)?”\n\n(pergunta G15).\n\nFigura 6.22. Nível de instrução – Peticionários Vs.. População portuguesa (em %)\n\nFonte: peticionários: Inquérito aos Peticionários 1999-2012; População portuguesa: População: Inquérito aos Cidadãos Portugueses (Freire, Viegas e Lisi 2012)\n\nNota: peticionários (n=196); População portuguesa (n=1203)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n141\n\nMais de metade dos peticionários completou o ensino superior (politécnico ou\n\nuniversitário – licenciatura ou superior) e um terço fez doze anos completos de estudos\n\n(secundário). Isto sugere, como seria de esperar, que o nível de instrução dos peticionários situa se muito acima da média da população portuguesa (Z=-13,064, p<.05) (apenas 15% da\n\npopulação portuguesa tem formação superior158). Consequentemente, existe uma diminuta\n\nrepresentação da população com menos estudos. Com efeito, apenas cerca de 11% dos\n\ninquiridos fez, no máximo, 9 anos de escolaridade completa, o que contrasta com os dados da\n\npopulação portuguesa (em que 70,3% só completou até 9 anos de escolaridade) (Z=-15,937,\n\np<.05) e 33,7% dos inquiridos tem doze anos completos de escolaridade, muito acima dos\n\n14,8% da população portuguesa (Z=6,465, p<.05).\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nFigura 6.23.

Segundo os dados recolhidos no\n\ninquérito, observa-se um crescimento significativo das petições oriundas de cidadãos com nível\n\nde instrução intermédio (12 anos de escolaridade), o que aconteceu à custa de uma diminuição\n\n158 Estes valores também são confirmados pelos Censos 2011.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n142\n\ndo peso dos peticionários com 9 ou menos anos de escolaridade, bem como de uma ligeira\n\ndiminuição do peso dos que têm formação superior159.\n\nEste dado parece contrariar em parte a nossa expectativa de que as petições-E\n\nagravariam a sobre-representação dos que têm mais recursos educativos. Assim, esperávamos\n\nque fosse o grupo de cidadãos com mais habilitações (ensino superior) a aproveitar mais esta\n\noportunidade oferecida pelas novas tecnologias. Não parece ter sido o que aconteceu. Segundo\n\nos dados do inquérito, aqueles que veem o seu peso aumentar são os cidadãos que completaram\n\no ensino secundário (doze anos de escolaridade). No entanto, aquela expectativa também se\n\nconfirma em parte, na medida em que se verifica uma diminuição dos peticionários menos\n\ninstruídos (até 9 anos de escolaridade), em benefício dos peticionários com nível de instrução\n\nintermédio.\n\nÉ verdade que esta variação parece acompanhar de algum modo a evolução do nível de\n\ninstrução da população portuguesa, que viu, na última década, a proporção de cidadãos com doze\n\nanos de escolaridade aumentar de 23% para 32%. Com efeito, os censos de 2011 revelam, em\n\ncomparação com os de 2001, uma diminuição dos cidadãos com menos habilitações (sem\n\nqualquer nível de instrução concluído, primário incompleto), que passam de 18% para 10%, em\n\nbenefício dos que concluíram 9 e 12 anos de escolaridade (que passam de 38% para 50% e 23%\n\npara 32%, respetivamente), o que ajudará a explicar a variação referida nesta camada da\n\npopulação. Contudo, é igualmente verdade que também se regista, no mesmo período, um\n\naumento significativo dos que concluíram formação superior (a percentagem de licenciados sobe\n\nde 9% para 15%). Ora, como se viu, o peso destes últimos diminuiu ligeiramente no universo de\n\npeticionários.\n\nAtendendo ao que se expôs, a nossa interpretação vai no sentido de que o sistema de\n\npetições-E parece contribuir, ainda que de forma tímida, para contrariar a sobre-representação dos\n\ncidadãos com mais recursos educativos. No entanto, este contributo é mitigado pela diminuição da\n\nrepresentação da população menos instruída. Assim, parecem ser apenas parcialmente atingidos\n\nobjetivos de “inclusão e igualdade” a este nível.\n\n159Atendendo a que os dados em causa não respeitam os pressupostos para aplicação do teste do Qui-quadrado (16% - menos de 20% - das células tem casos esperados inferiores a 5), este não foi aplicado.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Segue-se a Escócia, em que a\n\nrepresentação deste grupo é sensivelmente do dobro do seu peso na sociedade. Finalmente, a\n\nAlemanha, onde o equilíbrio é maior, registando uma diferença de apenas 39% relativamente à\n\npopulação alemã com formação superior. Neste último caso, e conforme observam Riehm,\n\nBöhle, e Lindner (2014), contribui a elevada percentagem que o sistema alemão tem de\n\npeticionários jovens, ainda sem idade para terem completado qualquer tipo de formação\n\nsuperior.\n\nNa análise comparativa entre os diferentes países é possível observar que não existem\n\ndiferenças estatisticamente significativas entre a proporção de peticionários com o ensino\n\nsuperior observada entre Portugal e a Escócia (Z= -1,010; p>.05).

Interesse pela política\n\nNo âmbito da participação política e associativa dos inquiridos, perguntou-se qual o seu\n\ninteresse pela política: “De uma maneira geral, qual o seu interesse pela política: tem muito\n\ninteresse, algum interesse, pouco interesse ou nenhum interesse?” (pergunta B5).\n\nFigura 6.25.

Conforme se pode ver na figura 6.25, apenas cerca de 33% dos portugueses se\n\ndeclaram interessados na política, com a grande maioria (67%) a manifestar nenhum ou pouco\n\ninteresse, sendo esta diferença estatisticamente significativa (Z=14,286; p<.05).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Apenas uma minoria se\n\nconsidera de direita (14,6%).\n\nConfrontados estes dados com os da população portuguesa, verificamos que os peticionários\n\nparecem ser um pouco mais de esquerda, menos ao centro e representam fielmente a proporção\n\ndos cidadãos de direita. Estas conclusões são suportadas pelos testes estatísticos de comparação de\n\nproporções entre duas amostras (ZEsquerda=2,969; p<.05, ZCentro=2,969; p<.05, ZDireita=2,969;\n\np<.05).\n\nDeste modo, não se confirma a expectativa do início deste trabalho de que os peticionários\n\nse situariam ideologicamente mais à direita, por serem estes mais propensos a aderir a formas\n\ninstitucionais de participação política, replicando os preditores da participação institucional de\n\níndole política (Viegas, Teixeira e Amador 2015).\n\nCom vista a conseguirmos uma análise um pouco mais fina, recodificámos as respostas\n\nsobre o autoposicionamento ideológico, criando uma variável com sete escalões: \"extrema esquerda\", \"esquerda\", \"centro-esquerda\", \"centro\", \"centro-direita\", \"direita\" e \"extrema-direita\".\n\nDe acordo com os dados do inquérito, os peticionários situam-se mais à esquerda e, dentro\n\ndesta, entre a esquerda e o centro-esquerda, obtendo o extremo (extrema-esquerda) uma\n\npercentagem residual. Curiosamente, a principal diferença que notamos em comparação com a\n\npopulação portuguesa é um maior posicionamento desta na extrema-esquerda (11,2%, contra 5,3%\n\ndos peticionários) do que à esquerda (8,1%, contra 21,1% dos peticionários), o que está em linha,\n\ncomo veremos mais à frente, com a maior participação neste instrumento de participação de\n\ncidadãos que se dizem identificar com a CDU (PCP/PEV), coligação partidária que se encontra\n\nclaramente sobre-representada.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Isto pode estar relacionado com uma das características\n\ndeste direito, ou seja, com o facto de o seu exercício não representar qualquer forma de apoio a um\n\npartido (contrariamente, por exemplo, ao direito de voto), podendo ser, assim, mais apelativo para\n\nos que estão mais à margem do sistema. No entanto, e tendo em conta o momento em que o\n\ninquérito foi realizado (final de 2013 até meados de 2014), em plena crise financeira, com reflexos\n\nna confiança dos cidadãos na política e nas suas instituições (Freire 2012, Lobo 2013), não é de\n\ndescartar, antes pelo contrário, a contaminação desta conjuntura na resposta a esta pergunta.\n\nEsta elevada proporção de peticionários que não se identifica com nenhum dos partidos\n\nassinalados vai ao encontro do sentimento da população portuguesa, que mostra, no entanto, uma\n\npercentagem significativamente mais expressiva (49%) (Z=-2,879; p<.05). Há, porém, uma\n\ndiferença que vale a pena sublinhar, que consiste em 8,5% dos peticionários se identificarem com\n\noutros partidos, que não os da representação parlamentar (na altura em que foi realizado o\n\ninquérito eram estes os partidos com assento na Assembleia da República), quando na população\n\nportuguesa não chega a 1% (Z=6,723; p<.05).\n\nApesar das considerações feitas, mais de metade dos inquiridos manifesta preferência por\n\num dos partidos políticos com representação parlamentar.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n150\n\nidentifica-se com partidos da área da esquerda ou do centro-esquerda (cerca de 40%), sendo a\n\nCDU (i.e. PCP e PEV) a que recolhe maior preferência, encontrando-se claramente sobre representada (Z=4,697; p<.05) – o que se deverá a um tipo de eleitorado mais propenso a formas\n\nde ação política de protesto (cfr. Viegas, Belchior e Seiceira 2010) - ao passo que o PS é o que tem\n\no peso mais contrastante com o que apresenta entre a população em geral (13,6% Vs. 23,3% Z= 2,578; p<.05). A direita e o centro direita recolhem cerca de 15% das manifestações dos\n\ninquiridos, quase todos no PSD, apenas um pouco acima dos 12% que manifesta esta preferência\n\npartidária no inquérito à população. Ou seja, não se verificam diferenças estatisticamente\n\nsignificativas entre os peticionários e a população portuguesa relativamente aos que se identificam\n\ncom o PSD (Z=0,853; p>.05) e com o CDS-PP (Z=-0,938; p>.05), o que contribui de forma\n\npositiva para a eficácia do sistema.\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nFigura 6.30.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n151\n\nestatisticamente significativa (χ2(1)=0,033, p<.05). Como assinalado, sobe ainda a percentagem de\n\npeticionários que se identificam com outros partidos, além dos representados no parlamento. A\n\nnosso ver, isto pode encontrar explicação em dois fatores.\n\nPor um lado, o alargamento do universo de peticionários a novos públicos, nomeadamente a\n\ngrupos mais jovens, conforme é sugerido acima, encontra uma das suas manifestações neste\n\nindicador, sugerindo um público menos militante e menos familiarizado com a política partidária\n\ndo que os peticionários do sistema convencional. Se refletir efetivamente que o direito de petição\n\nchegou a um público onde antes não chegava isto configuraria um reforço significativo da sua\n\neficácia, nomeadamente da que foi promovida pelas petições-E.\n\nContudo, e como já foi aflorado, esta desafeição partidária também pode traduzir um maior\n\ndesencantamento político, manifestado em vários estudos (Freire 2012; Lobo 2013; Magalhães\n\n2013) através da crescente desafeição não apenas com os partidos mas também com as instituições\n\npolíticas. Porém, se assim fosse, seria razoável supor que também afetaria o juízo dos\n\npeticionários convencionais, o que não parece ter acontecido.\n\nAliás, a anterior interpretação é ainda reforçada com outro dado, que é a descida de todos os\n\npartidos com os quais os peticionários dizem identificar-se, com destaque para a descida da CDU\n\n(de 28% para 19,2%) e, principalmente, do PS, que cai para menos de metade (de 32% para\n\n13,6%)161.\n\nContextualização com o caso da Escócia e da Alemanha\n\nO estudo de Carman (2006) sobre o sistema escocês também se debruçou sobre esta questão\n\nda identidade partidária, tendo também revelado uma percentagem considerável de inquiridos que\n\ndeclararam não se identificar com nenhum partido (cerca de 35%), contrastando com os dados da\n\npopulação escocesa (que atribuem apenas 13% aos cidadãos que não se identificam com nenhum\n\npartido), sugerindo que, também na Escócia – como em Portugal – o sistema de petições-E\n\nconseguiu atrair cidadãos que se encontram mais afastados da vida político-partidária, apesar de,\n\ncomo vimos, terem bastante interesse na política.\n\n161 Inquéritos aos peticionários 1999-2012 (sistema convencional, n=25; petições-E, n=177)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Participação política e associativa\n\nEm relação a esta dimensão, pediu-se aos inquiridos que dissessem, “para cada uma das\n\ndiferentes formas de ação política referidas, se alguma vez fez, se não fez mas admite fazer ou se\n\nnão fez e não admite fazer em qualquer circunstância” (pergunta B6).\n\nInteressa-nos, pois, conhecer quais os hábitos de participação política dos peticionários, com\n\nvista a compreender em que medida se distinguem dos hábitos de participação da generalidade dos\n\ncidadãos portugueses. Ou seja, analisamos como é que estes cidadãos, que tomaram a iniciativa de\n\nparticipar através desta ferramenta de participação convencional, se envolvem noutras atividades\n\nde natureza política e social.\n\nPor outro lado, temos a expectativa de que a modernização deste direito (nomeadamente\n\ntornando mais informal o seu uso) tenha alargado o exercício deste direito a populações que\n\nhabitualmente não recorrem a ele e estão menos acostumadas a participar, sendo este um dos\n\nobjetivos que perpassa as modernizações do direito de petição (em Portugal e nos restantes países,\n\ncomo vimos na Parte II).

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n154\n\nQuanto à comparação com os hábitos de participação política da população portuguesa, os\n\ndados do inquérito mostram que os peticionários têm, em todas as formas de participação aí\n\nreferidas (com a exceção de provocar danos materiais em espaços públicos ou ocupar edifícios ou\n\nfábricas, embora a variação não seja significativa), um nível de participação significativamente\n\nacima da média.\n\nEsta descoberta não é de estranhar, na medida em que a participação institucional de índole\n\npolítica em Portugal (convencional e não convencional) é, considerando o quadro da Europa\n\nOcidental, muito baixa, o que resulta em grande parte da sua democratização tardia, que se seguiu\n\nao mais longo período ditatorial na Europa Ocidental, que se prolongou praticamente até ao início\n\ndo ultimo quartil do século XX (Viegas, Belchior e Seiceira 2010), mas também ao peso dos\n\npartidos políticos na vida política nacional, nomeadamente ao nível da participação dos\n\nmecanismos de participação dos cidadãos, tantas vezes monopolizando-os (Braga da Cruz 1995).\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nComo referido, interessa-nos também conhecer em que medida o sistema e petições-E\n\nlogrou trazer para o direito de petição grupos de cidadãos com menos hábitos de participação, um\n\ndos objetivos da participação eletrónica em geral e da modernização dos sistemas de petições, em\n\nparticular.\n\nDo quadro 6.5 parece resultar com alguma clareza que os peticionários do sistema de\n\npetições-E estão menos habituados a participar politicamente do que os do sistema de petições\n\nconvencional. É que resulta de 13 das 16 perguntas colocadas aos peticionários. A única pergunta\n\nem que os peticionários do sistema de petições-E se distinguem claramente dos convencionais é a\n\nque se prende com a “compra deliberada ou recusa de compra de algum produto por razões\n\npolíticas, éticas ou ambientais”, formas de ação tipicamente de protesto, e que registam, aliás, na\n\núltima década, também um crescimento entre a população portuguesa (Viegas, Teixeira e Amador\n\n2015)\n\nEstes dados sugerem que o objetivo de atrair novos grupos de cidadãos foi, nesta dimensão,\n\nbem-sucedido, robustecendo a eficácia deste direito, de acordo com os critérios acima delineados,\n\npromovendo a inclusão, o envolvimento dos cidadãos com a res publica, e a igualdade dos\n\ncidadãos.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Dois dados merecem realce.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n157\n\nPor um lado, a sugestão de que os peticionários portugueses são mais ativos do que os\n\nalemães em termos de militância partidária e sindical. Isto não reflete as diferenças entre as\n\nsociedades portuguesa e alemã, a última mais igualitária e com níveis mais elevados de\n\nparticipação política (convencional e não convencional) dos cidadãos (Viegas, Teixeira e Amador\n\n2015). Deste modo, podemos ensaiar uma explicação para a diferença revelada pelos dados, que\n\nconsiste no sistema de petições português ser mais desigual em comparação com o alemão, com\n\num nível de sobre-representação de determinados grupos da população, tradicionalmente mais\n\nativos, muito superior. Por outro lado, também se pode ver aqui refletido o elevado número de\n\npeticionários que se dizem identificar com a CDU (PCP e PEV), conforme vimos supra.\n\nPorém, outro dado a registar com interesse é que, contrariamente ao que se passa em\n\nPortugal, no sistema alemão os peticionários do sistema de petições-E revelam-se, de um modo\n\ngeral, mais ativos politicamente do que os do sistema convencional. Deste modo, as petições-E\n\nparecem ter contribuído para o agravamento das desigualdades existentes na participação da\n\nsociedade, ao atrair cidadãos altamente mobilizados e politicamente ativos (Lindner e Riehm\n\n2011). Recorde-se a circunstância peculiar do enquadramento institucional do sistema de petições\n\nalemão, que, como referimos, criou um sistema de petições-E (as “petições públicas”,\n\nexclusivamente eletrónico) em paralelo com o sistema convencional, mantendo, assim, muitos (a\n\nesmagadora maioria) dos peticionários à margem do sistema de petições-E. Pelo contrário, o\n\nsistema português, por ser uno, passou a integrar todos os peticionários no sistema de petições-E\n\ndesde o início da sua implementação, em 2005. O mesmo se pode dizer em relação ao sistema de\n\npetições escocês. Em ambos os casos, são integrados no sistema mesmo cidadãos que não tenham\n\nqualquer experiência com as chamadas Novas Tecnologias. Com efeito, qualquer cidadão que\n\nsubmeta uma petição em papel, apenas com assinaturas em papel, terá a sua petição publicada no\n\nsite das petições do sistema português e escocês, assim como o respetivo processo e relatório final.\n\nContrariamente ao que se passa na Alemanha.\n\nNo que diz respeito ao sistema escocês, dispomos apenas de dados relativamente à\n\ncomparação entre o nível de envolvimento comunitário dos peticionários e os da população\n\nescocesa. De acordo com Carman (2006), os peticionários mostram-se muito mais participativos e\n\nenvolvidos com a comunidade (através de organizações voluntárias, como associações e clubes\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n158\n\ndesportivos), do que a generalidade dos escoceses. Cerca de 75% dos peticionários declararam ter\n\nparticipado em organizações deste género, contra apenas 30% da população escocesa162.\n\n6.2.11. Confiança nas instituições políticas\n\nEm relação à confiança nas instituições políticas, perguntou-se aos peticionários para\n\nindicarem “das seguintes instituições, diga qual o grau de confiança que lhe inspira cada uma\n\ndelas” (pergunta C7).\n\nNo que diz respeito às perguntas sobre a confiança nas instituições políticas, aproveitámos\n\nas mesmas perguntas colocadas no inquérito aos cidadãos (Freire, Viegas e Lisi 2012), com vista a\n\nestabelecer, assim, uma comparação entre os peticionários e a população em geral.\n\nConforme se pode ver no Quadro 6.6, das instituições políticas aí referidas, aquela em\n\nrelação à qual se nota maior diferença entre a confiança manifestada pelos peticionários e a da\n\npopulação portuguesa é na confiança no Parlamento (diferença de 0,43 a favor dos peticionários).\n\nDo mesmo quadro retira-se, aliás, que as únicas diferenças estatisticamente significativas são,\n\nprecisamente, as que se prendem com a confiança no Parlamento (t(1095)=6,7219; p<,05) e com a\n\nconfiança no Governo (t(1095)=3,7300; p<,05). Isto sugere que, em comparação com a\n\ngeneralidade da comunidade portuguesa, os peticionários tendem a confiar mais no parlamento e,\n\ntambém, no Governo, o que não é estranho estando em causa um direito que, mesmo tendo em\n\nconta que, como referido, pode ter contornos de um direito de protesto, é exercido perante o\n\nParlamento, dirigindo-lhe um pedido para que aprecie a sua pretensão.\n\n162 Carman (2006), com base nas respostas dos escoceses ao inquérito do British Election Study 2005 (BES 2005), disponível em http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-object/2005-bes-post-election-survey/\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Este é um dado que contraria em parte a expectativa que\n\ntínhamos no início da nossa investigação e que consistia na hipótese de que o sistema de\n\npetições-E, através de um maior retorno aos peticionários por via do processo e da maior\n\npublicidade deste sistema, teria como consequência uma apreciação mais favorável dos cidadãos\n\nem relação às instituições políticas, em particular ao parlamento.\n\nContudo, também podemos verificar que o Parlamento é, em ambos os sistemas,\n\ndestacadamente, a instituição que recolhe globalmente uma apreciação mais favorável, sendo\n\nesta sempre positiva (superior a 2).\n\nOs resultados em análise refletem, a nosso ver, a descida na confiança nas instituições\n\npolíticas que se verifica na população portuguesa (Freire 2012, Magalhães 2013), bem como o\n\nfacto de a idade dos peticionários ter igualmente descido, sendo de esperar, na linha de Inglehart\n\n(1997), que estes, educados num ambiente pós-materialista, sejam mais críticos das instituições\n\npoliticas tradicionais. Como apontam vários estudos sobre a confiança institucional, indivíduos\n\nmais velhos revelam, por seu turno, maior tendência para confiar mais nas instituições políticas\n\ne sociais.\n\nContextualização com o caso da Escócia e da Alemanha\n\nContrariamente ao que sucede com os peticionários portugueses, os peticionários\n\nescoceses parecem, em geral, confiar menos nas instituições políticas do que a população\n\nescocesa, merecendo o parlamento escocês sensivelmente o mesmo nível de confiança entre os\n\ndois grupos (Carman 2006).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Assim, verificámos um impacto positivo ao nível da capacidade de atrair cidadãos mais\n\njovens, aproximando da média de idades da população portuguesa. De igual modo, o\n\nsistema de petições-E parece ter conseguido atrair cidadãos menos habituados à\n\nparticipação política e menos identificados com os partidos com representação\n\nparlamentar, indo assim ao encontro de uma representação mais fidedigna da população\n\nportuguesa.\n\niii. Identificámos ainda uma evolução positiva ao nível do autoposicionamento ideológico\n\ndos peticionários, aproximando o seu perfil do da população portuguesa.\n\niv. Ao nível dos restantes indicadores habitualmente usados para caracterizar socio demograficamente os cidadãos, o impacto foi, de um modo geral, indiferente, não sendo\n\nas variações significativas. Foi o que aconteceu ao nível da origem geográfica, do sexo\n\nou da situação profissional dos peticionários (permanecendo uma sobre-representação\n\nmuito significativa dos homens, da zona de Lisboa, em situação ativa). Também se\n\ncontinua a verificar uma sobre-representação dos peticionários com formação superior\n\n(apesar do ligeiro decréscimo que se nota nas petições-E), embora aqui a hipótese para\n\nque apontava a literatura era que esta oportunidade de participação seria melhor\n\naproveitada pelos cidadãos com mais recursos sociais, nomeadamente educativos, o que\n\nnão se verifica.\n\nv. De um modo geral, o impacto das petições-E na eficácia do sistema foi positivo,\n\nporquanto contribuiu para a “igualdade e inclusão” e para o “envolvimento na res\n\npublica” de grupos da população sub-representados entre os peticionários. Nos restantes\n\nindicadores analisados neste capítulo, não os afetou de forma significativa.\n\nvi. Porém, existem situações que refletem uma desigualdade no uso deste instrumento, quer\n\nantes, quer depois da introdução do sistema de petições-E. É o caso, por exemplo, dos\n\npeticionários ativos, que constituem a esmagadora maioria dos que utilizam este direito,\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n164\n\n6.3. Como avaliam os peticionários o sistema de petições De seguida, analisamos a avaliação dos peticionários com base na análise tripartida\n\nadotada por Carman (2010): “expectativas”, “processo” e “resultados”. Através das\n\n“expectativas”, pretendemos obter um conhecimento do que os peticionários esperavam obter\n\nquando submeteram as petições. Através do “processo”, uma avaliação dos peticionários acerca da\n\nforma como a petição e o peticionário foram tratados durante a sua apreciação. Finalmente, pelos\n\n“resultados”, espera-se conhecer a opinião dos peticionários sobre o que foi conseguido com a\n\npetição, isto é, com o exercício deste direito.\n\nDeve ser notado que uma das limitações deste inquérito resulta do facto de este pedir que\n\nos peticionários se recordem das suas expectativas quando submeteram as petições. Isto coloca\n\nnaturalmente questões em termos de validade destas respostas. Idealmente, a expectativa dos\n\npeticionários deveria ser aferida até ao momento da submissão da petição. De igual modo, a\n\nmemória da expectativa – mas também do processo e do resultado - de uma petição com 15 anos\n\npode ser diferente de uma petição mais recente. Com efeito, o decurso do tempo pode afetar,\n\natravés de novas experiências do inquirido, a avaliação que se solicita. Esta é uma limitação a ter\n\nem conta na interpretação dos dados. Apesar destes constrangimentos, acreditamos que os dados\n\nrecolhidos poderão dar-nos algumas pistas relevantes sobre o exercício deste direito.\n\nA questão levantada no parágrafo anterior é particularmente relevante quando se pede\n\naos inquiridos que descrevam retrospetivamente as expetativas que tinham quando submeteram\n\na petição. É precisamente sobre as expectativas que nos debruçamos de seguida.\n\n6.3.1. Expectativas\n\nEm relação às expectativas, começámos por perguntar: “Diga-me, por favor, se discorda\n\ntotalmente, discorda, nem concorda nem discorda, concorda ou concorda totalmente com cada\n\numa das seguintes afirmações referentes às expectativas quanto ao processo de petições”\n\n(pergunta A2):\n\n- \"No momento em que apresentei a petição ao Parlamento esperava que fosse tratada de\n\nforma adequada\" (pergunta A2.1);\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Por um lado, a maior\n\nvisibilidade que as petições-E trouxeram a este direito deveria ter criado uma expectativa\n\nacrescida (era também essa a nossa expectativa) em relação a este direito, em comparação com a\n\nsituação anterior, o que não parece ter acontecido. No entanto, essa mesma exposição que o\n\nsistema de petições-E proporciona pode tornar mais evidentes as limitações e o alcance do\n\ndireito de petição, podendo ser gerador, à partida, de alguma apreensão relativamente aos\n\nresultados deste exercício.\n\nContextualização com o caso da Escócia e da Alemanha\n\nQuadro 6.11.

Avaliação do processo\n\nEm relação ao processo, os inquiridos foram questionados sobre o seguinte: “Diga-me, por\n\nfavor, se discorda totalmente, discorda, nem concorda nem discorda, concorda ou concorda totalmente com\n\ncada uma das seguintes afirmações referentes à avaliação do processo de petições (pergunta A3):\n\n- \"Estou satisfeito/a com a forma como a minha petição foi tratada pelo Parlamento\" (A3.1)\n\n- \"Considerei o processo de petições fácil de compreender\" (A3.2)\n\n- \"A comissão parlamentar competente manteve-me informado/a da evolução do processo em todas as fases\"\n\n(A3.3)\n\n- \"A minha petição foi tratada de forma adequada pela comissão parlamentar competente\" (A3.4)\n\n- \"O sistema de petições permite que os cidadãos comuns tenham uma voz mais forte\" (A3.5)\n\n- \"O sistema de petições ajuda a aproximar o Parlamento dos cidadãos\" (A3.6)\n\nDas respostas dos inquiridos, foi possível obter os seguintes dados relativamente aos três\n\nprincipais indicadores do processo.\n\nQuadro 6.12. “Avaliação do Processo” pelos peticionários (em %)\n\nn Discordo totalmente\n\nDiscordo Nem concordo\n\nNem discordo\n\nConcordo Concordo\n\ntotalmente Processo fácil de compreender\n\n253 2,4 5,5 19,8 43,9 28,5\n\nComissão manteve informado da evolução do processo\n\n248 17,3 21,4 18,5 30,6 12,1\n\nTratamento pela comissão 249 19,3 20,1 24,5 26,1 10,0\n\nFonte: Inquérito aos Peticionários 1999-2012\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n168\n\nEm relação ao processo, os peticionários consideram maioritariamente que o processo é\n\nfácil de compreender (72%). Embora menos de oito por cento não concordem com a afirmação,\n\nexistem cerca de 20% dos inquiridos que não concordam nem discordam com a mesma.\n\nNoutra dimensão da avaliação do processo, os peticionários dividem-se sensivelmente\n\nentre os que consideram que a comissão parlamentar os manteve informados em todas as fases\n\nao longo do processo (cerca de 43%) e os que com isto discordam (cerca de 39%). Tal como na\n\npergunta anterior, existe uma percentagem considerável que não concorda nem discorda (quase\n\n18,5%).\n\nQuanto à forma como os peticionários consideram que a petição foi tratada pela\n\ncomissão, 36% é da opinião que foi tratada de forma adequada, enquanto cerca de 39% discorda\n\ndesta asserção.\n\nComparando com as altas expetativas que os peticionários tinham relativamente ao\n\ntratamento das suas petições, vemos que, na sua maioria, estas não foram cumpridas.\n\nForam ainda feitas duas perguntas (A3.5 e A3.6), através das quais se pretendia conhecer\n\ncomo é que os peticionários avaliam o processo de petições, tanto ao nível de “permitir que os\n\ncidadãos comuns tenham uma voz mais forte”, como de “ajudar a aproximar o Parlamento dos\n\ncidadãos”. A este respeito, interessa notar que a grande maioria dos peticionários que já\n\nexerceram este direito considera que o processo de petições promove a aproximação do\n\nParlamento aos cidadãos (cerca de 67%) e que o sistema permite que os cidadãos tenham uma\n\nvoz mais forte (62%).\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nQuadro 6.13. “Avaliação do Processo” pelos peticionários – sistema Convencional Vs.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n169\n\nNo entanto, é frutífero verificar a diferença que apresentam os peticionários pré petições E e os que submeteram petições no quadro desta modernização.\n\nAssim, verifica-se uma ligeira subida da média de avaliação dos peticionários quanto à\n\nfacilidade de compreensão do processo, que já merecia, aliás, uma avaliação globalmente\n\npositiva no sistema convencional (passando de 3,73 para 3,91). Apesar deste ligeiro aumento,\n\nesperar-se-ia um impacto maior, refletindo a maior informação disponível e a maior publicidade\n\nque o sistema de petições-E promove. A nosso ver, consideramos que isto espelha de algum\n\nmodo as carências que o sistema português ainda tem ao nível da disponibilização de conteúdos\n\ninformativos, muito aquém do potencial deste sistema, conforme sublinhamos, aliás, quando\n\ncotejado com o sistema de petições-E escocês.\n\nEm segundo lugar, também se nota uma diferença de 0.30 na média da avaliação dos\n\npeticionários acerca do tratamento dado à petição, verificando-se que os peticionários do\n\nsistema de petições-E se manifestam mais satisfeitos. Esta diferença pode traduzir a diminuição\n\nsignificativa do tempo de apreciação das petições por parte do Parlamento no sistema de\n\npetições-E, que contrasta com a morosidade do período anterior (ver infra) e, claro, com a maior\n\npublicidade conferida a cada petição e respetivo processo.\n\nPorém, a diferença mais significativa encontra-se na avaliação dos peticionários acerca\n\nda informação obtida pelo Parlamento ao longo do processo da petição, registando-se um\n\naumento de 2,37 (uma média que reflete uma opinião globalmente negativa) para 2,99 (opinião\n\nglobalmente positiva). A este respeito, não deve ser negligenciada a possibilidade de, sendo as\n\npetições convencionais mais antigas, e a sua memória mais distante, serem mais suscetíveis de\n\nos peticionários não se lembrarem tão claramente da experiência. No entanto, é razoável\n\npresumir que esta diferença (o dobro) na percentagem de peticionários que consideram terem\n\nsido informados de todos os passos durante processo reflita a maior informação disponibilizada\n\natravés do sistema de petições-E, nomeadamente ao nível da tramitação processual.\n\nEm relação às duas últimas perguntas, confrontadas as avaliações dos dois sistemas,\n\nverificamos que o sistema de petições-E apresenta médias ligeiramente superiores em relação ao\n\nperíodo em que vigorou o sistema Convencional, em particular quanto aos peticionários\n\nconsiderarem que o “sistema permite que os cidadãos tenham uma voz mais forte”.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Esta diferença pode dever-se ao investimento que, desde o\n\ninício, o sistema de petições-E escocês fez na divulgação do sistema e do seu procedimento163,\n\nalgo que ainda é muito incipiente no caso português. Com efeito, o sistema escocês tem\n\nabundante informação e material de divulgação e explicativo do direito de petição – do\n\nfuncionamento do sistema, da submissão ao relatório final -, que vai do recurso a múltiplas\n\nlínguas (incluindo língua árabe, mandarim, Bengali ou Urdu, entre outras), até ao uso de vídeos\n\nanimados e infografias (supra). Isto dever-se-à novidade do direito de petição no ordenamento\n\njurídico-político escocês, aquando da sua criação em 1999. Porém, e até por esta circunstância,\n\nnão deixa de ser de assinalar que o direito mais recente (em comparação com o português) seja,\n\ntambém, considerado mais fácil de compreender, o que atestará o sucesso do esforço\n\npedagógico do parlamento escocês.\n\nJá em relação à informação obtida ao longo do processo, os inquiridos do sistema\n\nportuguês parecem considerar-se um pouco mais bem informados do que os peticionários\n\n163 Esforço assumido abertamente desde o início, explicando como é que o direito pode ser exercido e quais os resultados que podem ser esperados (cfr. questionário a Anne Peat, clerk da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento escocês, realizado a 28-01-2015)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n171\n\nescoceses (43% contra 35% que consideraram terem sido informados; e 39% contra 56% que\n\ndeclararam não terem sido informados).\n\nJá em relação à forma como a petição foi tratada pela comissão, embora exista a mesma\n\npercentagem de inquiridos a manifestarem-se satisfeitos (36%), a percentagem daqueles que\n\npensa que a sua petição não mereceu tratamento adequado pela comissão é significativamente\n\nsuperior no caso português (39% contra apenas 13%).\n\nEm ambos os casos, existe uma descida assinalável no confronto entre as expectativas\n\ndos peticionários relativamente à adequação do tratamento (um tratamento justo) e a avaliação\n\nda experiência concreta.\n\nNo caso alemão, a percentagem de peticionários do sistema de petições públicas que se\n\nmanifestam satisfeitos com o tratamento da petição é sensivelmente o mesmo dos casos escocês\n\ne português (36,3%) (Riehm, Böhle e Lindner 2014, pp. 101).\n\nVale a pena atentar no exemplo escocês, que se caracteriza por um apoio, antes e durante\n\no processo, da parte dos funcionários parlamentares mas, também, dos membros do parlamento.\n\nCom efeito, uma grande maioria dos peticionários (70%) declarou ter procurado a ajuda de um\n\ndeputado antes de submeterem a petição, tendo a maioria (75%) manifestado satisfação pela\n\najuda recebida (Carman 2006).\n\nNo caso português, bem como no alemão164, este contacto com um membro do\n\nparlamento está menos enraizado, assim como o contacto sistemático com os funcionários do\n\nparlamento. Todavia, este também ocorre, nomeadamente por via dos contactos disponíveis\n\nonline para os grupos parlamentares, para os serviços de relações públicas e informação ao\n\ncidadão da Assembleia da República e para o Presidente da Assembleia da República, os quais\n\nesclarecem, com regularidade, as questões colocadas pelos peticionários. No entanto, pensamos\n\nque, no caso português, a ausência de um interlocutor institucional, como é o caso do clerk da\n\nComissão de Petições escocês, pode dificultar este apoio, havendo, neste âmbito, alguma\n\nmargem de melhoria do sistema português.\n\n164 Cfr.

No entanto, cerca de 53%\n\nnão considera que a petição tenha sido um sucesso,\n\nSobre a petição \"ter sido devidamente considerada\", cerca de 38% concorda com a\n\nafirmação, não muito distante dos cerca de 40% que discordam.\n\nPor último, quanto à satisfação com o resultado do processo da petição, apenas cerca de\n\n20% se mostrou satisfeito. Cerca de 66% de inquiridos mostraram-se insatisfeitos com o\n\nreferido resultado, havendo uma percentagem diminuta de inquiridos que não se decidiram nem\n\npela concordância nem pela discordância.\n\nNa nossa interpretação, estes dados sugerem que os peticionários distinguem, apesar de\n\ntudo, o que foi o papel desempenhado pelo Parlamento no quadro das suas competências (“a\n\npetição ter sido devidamente considerada”), que obtém o melhor nível de satisfação dos três\n\nindicadores (38%), do resultado obtido com o exercício deste instrumento (“satisfação com o\n\nresultado do processo da petição”), ligado ao acolhimento da pretensão do peticionário e que\n\nobtém, compreensivelmente, um nível de satisfação bastante inferior (20%).

Assim,\n\nnota-se um ligeiro aumento (de 2,45 para 2,53) da avaliação dos peticionários que consideram que\n\na petição foi um sucesso e, por outro lado, uma ligeira diminuição (de 2,23 para 2.19) da\n\napreciação acerca do resultado obtido com a petição, que se mantém em terreno negativo.\n\nOu seja, os peticionários parecem reconhecer, na passagem do sistema convencional para o\n\nde petições-E, um papel mais adequado do Parlamento no tratamento da petição (que, como já\n\nadiantámos acima, pode espelhar a diminuição significativa do tempo de apreciação das petições).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

No entanto, os restantes indicadores\n\nmostram um nível de discordância em Portugal bastante mais baixo e, em contrapartida, um\n\nmaior peso dos peticionários que consideraram a petição um sucesso, bem como que a mesma\n\nfoi devidamente considerada (neste último caso, chegando quase aos 40%, muito acima dos\n\n23% da Escócia).\n\nGlobalmente, as pistas fornecidas por estes dados parecem apontar no sentido de os\n\npeticionários do sistema de petições-E português mostrarem-se ligeiramente mais satisfeitos do\n\nque os da Escócia.\n\nRiehm, Böhle e Lindner (2014) também inquiriram os peticionários do sistema de\n\npetições alemão acerca da forma como avaliavam os resultados obtidos com o processo das suas\n\npetições.

Interessante também notar que, confrontados os dados de inquérito entre\n\npeticionários do sistema convencional e de petições-E, também no caso alemão não foi possível\n\nidentificar grandes diferenças.

De um modo geral, as expectativas sobre o tratamento da petição mantiveram-se ao mesmo\n\nnível tanto no sistema convencional como a seguir à introdução das petições-E.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n177\n\nnão parece ter acontecido. Isso pode dever-se ao facto de essa maior exposição que o\n\nsistema de petições-E proporciona poder tornar mais evidentes as limitações e o alcance do\n\ndireito de petição, podendo ser gerador, à partida, de alguma apreensão relativamente aos\n\nresultados deste exercício. Deste modo, se desajustadas, as expectativas elevadas podem\n\ncontribuir negativamente para a eficácia do sistema, por poderem traduzir-se, mais tarde,\n\nem desilusão. Ou vice-versa. Daí não termos considerado, isoladamente, este indicador\n\ncomo critério de eficácia.\n\nii. Quanto ao processo, é de realçar que todos os indicadores analisados registam uma melhor\n\navaliação no sistema de petições-E, em particular na avaliação do tratamento dado à\n\npetição - o que poderá refletir, a nosso ver, a diminuição significativa do tempo de\n\napreciação das petições por parte do Parlamento no sistema de petições-E -, assim como a\n\navaliação dos peticionários acerca da informação obtida do Parlamento ao longo do\n\nprocesso da petição, provavelmente fruto da maior informação disponibilizada através do\n\nsistema de petições-E, nomeadamente ao nível da tramitação processual. Na nossa análise,\n\no impacto verifica-se ao nível da “adesão”, feedback e “Informação e prestação de contas”.\n\niii. Quanto aos resultados, a diferença mais significativa verifica-se ao nível da opinião sobre a\n\nconsideração que a petição mereceu por parte do Parlamento, ou seja, os peticionários têm,\n\nno sistema de petições-E, uma perceção mais favorável acerca da forma como o\n\nParlamento tratou a petição, robustecendo, por esta via, o feedback devido aos cidadãos.\n\nEm relação aos outros dois indicadores, não se verificam variações significativas.\n\niv. Ou seja, os peticionários parecem reconhecer, na passagem do sistema convencional para o\n\nde Petições-E, um papel mais adequado do Parlamento no tratamento da petição. No\n\nentanto, esta avaliação não se repercutiu nem se confundiu com a avaliação do sucesso da\n\npetição ou do resultado obtido com a mesma.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n178\n\n6.4. O comportamento do Governo\n\n6.4.1. A resposta às questões do Parlamento\n\nA lei prevê diversas prerrogativas a que o Parlamento pode recorrer na apreciação das\n\npetições. Destas, destaca-se a de questionar o executivo sobre a matéria em causa na petição,\n\nobrigando o Governo a tomar posição sobre a questão concreta suscitada pela petição (de que\n\noutra forma os cidadãos têm um poder análogo?), afigurando-se como uma das principais\n\nformas de carrear informação para o processo das petições.\n\nEmbora semelhantes na sua natureza, estas perguntas não devem ser confundidas com o\n\ndireito de os Deputados fazerem perguntas ao Governo e à Administração Pública, que tem um\n\nregime próprio165, nomeadamente quanto ao prazo (que é de 30 dias) e à sanção (simbólica) de\n\npublicação no site da Assembleia da Republica das perguntas que não obtiveram resposta dentro\n\ndo prazo166. As perguntas realizadas no âmbito do processo de petição constituem “poderes da\n\ncomissão”167, normalmente com vista a obter uma tomada de posição da entidade competente\n\nsobre a matéria em causa (frequentemente o Governo), definindo a lei a obrigatoriedade da\n\nresposta num prazo de 20 dias para o efeito (tendo o cumprimento desta obrigação prioridade\n\nsobre quaisquer outros serviços da Administração Pública). A prática, porém, nem sempre é\n\nconsentânea com o que a lei perspetiva.\n\nPelo menos desde 1991 que a Assembleia da República chama a atenção para a\n\nnecessidade de melhorar a articulação entre as comissões e as entidades competentes para a\n\nresolução das questões em razão da matéria, à cabeça o Governo, queixando-se em particular da\n\nmorosidade nas respostas destas entidades (normalmente solicitadas a pronunciarem-se sobre a\n\npetição), prejudicando uma apreciação em tempo razoável das petições em causa por parte do\n\nParlamento (Tibúrcio 2010).\n\n165 CRP [artigo 166.º, alínea d)] e RAR [artigo 4.º, número 1, alínea d); artigo 229.º e artigo 230] 166 Um desenvolvimento deste tema das Perguntas e Requerimentos enquanto instrumentos de controlo do Governo pode ser encontrado em Seguro (2015). 167 Artigo 20.º da LDP.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n179\n\nReferimos acima existirem três indicadores fundamentais para aferir a eficácia do\n\ncomportamento do Governo em relação às petições: i) As petições suscitam, com frequência, o\n\nenvio de perguntas ao Governo? ii) A maioria destas questões merece uma resposta do\n\nexecutivo? iii) O Governo responde num prazo razoável? Debruçamo-nos, de seguida, sobre\n\ncada um deles.\n\n6.4.1.1. As petições suscitam, com frequência, o envio de perguntas ao Governo?\n\nA percentagem de petições que, no sistema de petições-E em vigor, suscita perguntas a\n\nentidades externas é de pouco mais de metade das petições, verificando-se na XI legislatura um\n\naumento assinalável, embora seguido de uma descida na 1.ª sessão da XII legislatura. Isto\n\nrepresenta o envio de 298 perguntas (50%) entre 2005 e 2009, 124 perguntas (69%) entre 2009 2011 e 91 perguntas entre 2011-2013 (55%).\n\nEmbora constituam exemplos raros, há casos de comissões que decidiram enviar, em\n\ntodas as petições, um pedido ao Governo para que este se pronuncie sobre a petição. É o\n\nexemplo da Comissão de Obras Públicas e da Comissão de Educação, Ciência e Cultura, ambas\n\nda XII legislatura (2011-2015). Esta última notifica ainda o peticionário do envio da pergunta e\n\nsolicita que este sugira, fundadamente, alguma entidade pertinente para ouvir, sugestão\n\nnormalmente acolhida168, prática que, ainda que pouco usual, constitui um reforço da eficácia\n\ndeste direito.\n\nQuadro 6.19.

A esta luz, a proporção de perguntas ter aumentado, ainda que\n\nligeiramente, constitui um sinal de melhoria da eficácia do sistema de petições-E, demonstrando\n\nconseguir lidar com sucesso com o aumento significativo de petições gerado pela reforma do\n\nsistema de petições que entrou em vigor em 2005.\n\nFigura 6.33.

A maioria destas perguntas recebe uma resposta do Governo?\n\nA percentagem de respostas no sistema de petições-E é de cerca de 3/4. Como se pode\n\ncomprovar pelo quadro 6.19, a X legislatura (05-09) apresenta a melhor taxa de resposta (quase\n\n80%), com a legislatura seguinte a manter-se próxima desta percentagem, seguido de um ligeiro\n\ndecréscimo (75% de respostas). No entanto, ainda existe cerca de 1/4 de perguntas que não\n\nobtém resposta, facto que se encontra espelhado em muitos relatórios finais das petições, que\n\nlamentam, assim, a falta de feedback por parte destas entidades.\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nPor outro lado, a percentagem de respostas parece estar melhor do que no período das\n\npetições convencionais, em que cerca de 1/3 das perguntas não obtinha resposta. Com o início\n\ndo sistema de petições-E, na X legislatura (05-09), regista-se a melhor taxa de resposta (quase\n\n80%), com a legislatura seguinte a manter-se próxima desta percentagem, seguido de um ligeiro\n\ndecréscimo (75% de respostas). Isto, apesar de, como vimos, o número de petições ter\n\naumentado exponencialmente desde a X legislatura.\n\nFigura 6.34. Taxa de respostas das entidades externas (v.g.

Recorde-se que a lei de petições prevê um (exigente) limite legal para estas\n\nentidades responderem: 20 dias. De acordo com os dados que recolhemos, existem, na XII\n\nlegislatura, 32 respostas dadas no cumprimento do prazo legal (25%).\n\nImpacto das petições eletrónicas (2005)\n\nA preocupação de encurtar o tempo de resposta constitui uma preocupação da\n\nAssembleia da República desde a década de 90 (Colóquio 1995 e Tibúrcio 2010). O que\n\npodemos ver no quadro 6.19 é uma diminuição deste tempo que vem ainda desde a altura do\n\nsistema de petições convencional. Desde então, este tem continuado a descer, particularmente\n\napós a entrada em vigor do sistema de petições-E (em 2005). Recorde-se que, como já\n\nreferimos, o impacto das petições-E nota-se melhor quando se tem em conta que a taxa de\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Para esse efeito, a nota de admissibilidade da petição identifica,\n\nfrequentemente, as entidades com possível interesse de serem consultadas a propósito da\n\npetição.\n\nFigura 6.36.

Convém\n\nnotar que esta informação é solicitada e a resposta enviada através da Assembleia da República.\n\nEsta intermediação é um dos contributos fundamentais da Assembleia da República – e os\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n184\n\nparlamentos em geral – para o sistema de petições, com benefício para os cidadãos – que\n\ndificilmente conseguiriam obter resposta análoga através de meios próprios. Daí o impacto que\n\nse logrou identificar acima. O pressuposto deste critério é, porém, que a informação prestada\n\nacrescente algo relativamente aos factos invocados na petição pelos cidadãos.\n\n*\n\nEm relação aos três indicadores referidos, vale a pena realçar que a evolução notada\n\nrepresenta um esforço considerável por parte destas entidades (maxime, o Governo) desde 2005,\n\nse tomarmos em consideração o facto de, como referido, o número de petições ter, desde a\n\nentrada em vigor do sistema de petições-E, mais do que triplicado em relação às legislaturas\n\nanteriores. Tanto o maior número de perguntas colocadas a estas entidades, como a melhoria\n\nregistada ao nível da taxa de respostas e da celeridade com que o fazem, contribuem para um\n\nreforço do “feedback”, da “igualdade e da inclusão”, “transparência” e “prestação de contas”,\n\nbem como do “debate e da influência” do sistema de petições.\n\nTodavia, Dalton, Scarrow e Cain (2004) alertam que a informação obtida através das\n\nformas de “advocacy democracy” pode exigir maiores recursos cognitivos dos cidadãos,\n\nprovocando desigualdades na participação. Os autores apoiam-se em outros exemplos\n\nenquadráveis nesta forma de democracia, como a participação numa consulta pública ou uma\n\nsolicitação ao abrigo do direito à informação, em que a informação é obtida de forma totalmente\n\nnão intermediada. No entanto, as informações obtidas no âmbito do processo peticionário são,\n\npor regra, opiniões do Governo acerca da pretensão contida na petição (e não tanto documentos\n\noriginais). Além de se poder ter acesso direto à resposta (que é inclusivamente publicada no\n\nsite), esta acaba por ser traduzida no relatório final, que pode aproveitar para explicá-la ao\n\npeticionário (o que, contudo, acontece com pouca frequência). Deste modo, a informação gerada\n\nneste âmbito acaba por ser menos suscetível de criar as desigualdades de que falam Dalton,\n\nScarrow e Cain.\n\nDo que se disse, retira-se que uma melhor articulação entre estas entidades deveria\n\ncontribuir para uma apreciação mais célere por parte do Parlamento.

Apesar de ultrapassar o tempo definido por lei para\n\nque a Assembleia da República conclua a apreciação de uma petição (60 dias), já se poderá dizer\n\nque se aproxima da intenção inscrita na constituição ao exigir a apreciação das petições \"em\n\ntempo razoável\", robustecendo por esta via o feedback ao cidadão (será mesmo o mais\n\nimportante indicador desta dimensão), tornando por esta via \"a participação mais efetiva\".\n\nO direito a uma resposta em prazo razoável tem sido um dos calcanhares de Aquiles\n\ndeste instituto, existindo a perceção de que o Parlamento não dá resposta às petições em prazo\n\nrazoável.

Preditores da avaliação dos peticionários e da confiança nas instituições políticas\n\nNeste capítulo derradeiro, analisamos, a partir dos resultados do inquérito aos\n\npeticionários, os preditores da avaliação dos peticionários. Como referido acima, esperamos que\n\na avaliação do processo determine, em grande medida, a avaliação que os peticionários fazem\n\ndos resultados deste direito, fundando-se a nossa expectativa na literatura e, também, nos\n\nresultados do estudo de Carman em relação ao sistema escocês.\n\nPor outro lado, consideramos que uma avaliação positiva do sistema de petições (do\n\nprocesso e dos resultados) irá ter uma relação positiva sobre o apoio dos cidadãos ao sistema\n\ncomo um todo e, em particular, à instituição parlamentar. Admitimos ainda que, tal como na\n\nEscócia (Carman 2006, 2010), os resultados do inquérito mostrarão que a avaliação do processo\n\npelos peticionários terá uma relação mais forte com a confiança nas instituições políticas do que\n\na avaliação dos resultados.\n\n7.1. Preditores da avaliação dos peticionários\n\nCom base na análise dos dados do estudo escocês, Carman (2006, 2010) concluiu que a\n\navaliação que os peticionários fazem do sistema de petições é largamente determinada pela\n\navaliação do processo (a forma como as suas petições foram tratadas) e não tanto pela avaliação\n\ndo resultado obtido com a petição.\n\nJá em 1974, num estudo sobre as petições parlamentares na Nova Zelândia, Hill’s\n\n(1974169) notou que os peticionários, mesmo sabendo da improbabilidade de as suas petições\n\nserem acolhidas, retiravam satisfação do facto de um grupo de deputados ter dedicado atenção\n\n(e tempo) às suas pretensões.\n\nIsto afigura-se particularmente relevante devido à configuração do direito de petição\n\ncomo, essencialmente, um direito a um processo, enquadrando-se no leque dos instrumentos de\n\nadvocacy democracy, em que o papel da participação contribui para eventuais (e incertas e, o\n\nmais das vezes, improváveis) decisões, mas nunca tomar diretamente as decisões.\n\n169 Apud Hough (2012)\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n192\n\nTendo tudo isto em consideração, esperamos que a avaliação que os peticionários fazem\n\ndo sistema de petições (resultados) seja determinada em grande medida pela avaliação dos\n\npeticionários acerca do tratamento da petição pelo parlamento (processo). Assim, o processo\n\ndeve ser não apenas justo e imparcial mas percecionado como tal. Deste modo, os peticionários\n\nque considerarem adequado o tratamento dado à petição durante o processo estarão mais\n\nrecetivos a considerarem-se satisfeitos com os resultados obtidos pelo exercício deste direito.\n\nEsta abordagem, que foi seguida por Carman em relação ao sistema de petições escocês,\n\nassenta na ideia de que, num qualquer processo político, a avaliação que um indivíduo faça\n\nacerca da forma como esse processo decorreu (adequado/justo) tem influência na disposição\n\npara aceitar os resultados desse processo (Tyler 1997; 2000; Hibbing e Theis-Morse 2001)170.\n\nSendo, à partida, improvável que os peticionários obtenham a satisfação do pedido – o que\n\ndecorre da forma de democracia em causa, que deixa na liberdade dos representantes políticos a\n\ndecisão final. Sendo que, no caso português, não há, sequer, obrigatoriedade de decisão,\n\nconsidera-se que a avaliação do processo tem uma importância nevrálgica.\n\nAssim, apresentamos de seguida um modelo estatístico multivariado que pretende\n\ndeterminar quais são os preditores estatísticos da “avaliação dos peticionários”.\n\nNeste modelo temos como variável dependente (VD) a “avaliação do resultado”, um\n\níndice sintético criado pelos três indicadores acima identificados da avaliação dos resultados: i)\n\n“Petição devidamente considerada”; ii) “Petição foi um sucesso” e iii) “Satisfação com o\n\nresultado da petição”), tal como fez Carman (2010) num dos estudos sobre o caso escocês.\n\nCom esta VD pretende-se prever a avaliação dos inquiridos em relação ao resultado das\n\npetições com base em variáveis independentes (VIs) sobre as características dos peticionários\n\n(sexo, idade, instrução, interesse pela política e politicamente ativo), das petições (natureza do\n\ntitular, número de assinaturas), do seu processo (tipo de sistema em vigor, tempo de apreciação\n\npela AR, debate plenário e perguntas e respostas ao Governo), bem como as expectativas dos\n\npeticionários (tratamento adequado da petição e de que as suas preocupações fossem ouvidas\n\npelo parlamento) e a avaliação que fazem do processo (índice sintético dos 3 indicadores que\n\nmedem esta avaliação171).\n\n170 Apud Carman (2010) 171 i) Satisfação com a forma como a petição foi tratada pelo Parlamento; ii) Processo de petições fácil de compreender\"; iii) A comissão parlamentar competente manteve o peticionário informado/a da evolução do processo em todas as fases.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n193\n\nAssim, de maneira a avaliar a capacidade preditora dos indicadores abaixo indicados na\n\n“avaliação do resultado”, realizou-se uma regressão linear múltipla através do método de\n\nStepwise. A justificação para a utilização deste método assenta na retenção de variáveis que têm\n\ncontributo para o modelo, excluindo as que não têm, diminuindo, assim, o ruído do mesmo\n\n(Maroco 2007).

Isto vai ao encontro da nossa hipótese\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n195\n\nde partida, que assim se confirma, ou seja, mais do que qualquer outro fator, aquele que\n\ninfluencia mais a avaliação do resultado é o juízo do peticionário acerca do processo da petição.\n\nA segunda variável que mais contribui para variância da “avaliação do resultado” é “a\n\nexpectativa de que as preocupações fossem ouvidas”. A nosso ver, isto mostra que o sistema de\n\npetições está a desempenhar na prática adequadamente o papel que o legislador desenhou: o de\n\nser um instrumento que serve, primordialmente, para que as vozes dos peticionários sejam\n\nouvidas.\n\nA outra variável (a terceira) retida pelo modelo liga-se também às expectativas dos\n\npeticionários (“expectativa de tratamento adequado”). Porém, esta está associada negativamente\n\nà “avaliação do resultado”, sugerindo que os peticionários que tinham expectativas mais baixas\n\nem relação ao tratamento da petição são aqueles que acabam por avaliar melhor o resultado\n\ndesta experiência. Ainda que de forma algo contra-intuitiva, este resultado tem suporte na\n\nprática e, também, na literatura, quando assinala que expectativas desajustadas e exageradas dos\n\npeticionários em relação ao sistema de petições pode ser gerador de frustração com a\n\nexperiência (Bochel 2012). Estes resultados parecem evidenciar isto mesmo. Que grandes\n\nexpectativas em relação ao que o sistema pode oferecer podem resultar nalguma desilusão com a\n\nexperiência e, consequentemente, numa má avaliação da mesma. Coerentemente, aqueles que\n\nnão tinham expectativas tão altas sobre o tratamento da petição acabam por ficar mais satisfeitos\n\ncom o resultado deste exercício. A nosso ver, isto pode querer dizer que os peticionários do\n\nsistema português alimentam um excesso de expectativas em relação ao que o sistema pode\n\noferecer, aconselhando porventura a que a Assembleia da República forneça aos cidadãos\n\ninformação mais consentânea com o alcance deste direito.\n\nEm relação ao “autoposicionamento político”, os resultados sugerem que são os\n\npeticionários que se situam mais à esquerda aqueles que melhor avaliam o resultado da petição.\n\nEm contrapartida, os peticionários que se consideram mais à direita tendem a ter uma avaliação\n\nmais pessimista dos resultados obtidos pela petição.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n196\n\n7.2. Preditores da confiança nas instituições políticas\n\nRecorde-se que levantámos acima a hipótese de, tal como parece ter ocorrido na Escócia,\n\na avaliação dos peticionários em relação ao sistema de petições influenciar o nível de apoio às\n\ninstituições políticas e, em especial, ao parlamento. É do que trataremos agora.\n\nContinuamos na senda do estudo de Carman relativamente ao caso escocês (Carman\n\n2006). O enquadramento teórico encontra suporte na tese de Marcia Grimes (2005, 2006), que\n\ndefende que a avaliação que se possa fazer sobre a adequação do processo (transparente,\n\nimparcial) releva mais, no que diz respeito à confiança institucional, do que a capacidade\n\npessoal de influenciar o resultado da decisão. Carman apoia-se nesta tese para defender que os\n\npeticionários utilizarão esta experiência de relacionamento com o Parlamento para tirar ilações\n\nsobre a instituição parlamentar e, também, sobre as restantes instituições do sistema político.\n\nTendo em conta as raras oportunidades que a maioria dos cidadãos tem de interagir com o\n\nParlamento (conforme vimos acima, a maioria dos peticionários é também estreante), é natural\n\nque – defende Carman – esta experiência sirva para os peticionários formarem ou consolidarem\n\nideias sobre o Parlamento. Com efeito, também supomos que um peticionário que faça um juízo\n\nnegativo sobre a forma como foi tratado pela Assembleia da República no processo de\n\napreciação da sua petição seja naturalmente influenciado no juízo que faz sobre a confiança que\n\nlhe merece esta instituição.\n\nAssim, tal como observado no caso escocês, também no caso português se prevê\n\nencontrar uma relação positiva entre a avaliação dos peticionários (processo e resultado) e a\n\nconfiança nas instituições políticas portuguesas. Espera-se, ainda, que essa relação seja mais\n\nforte no caso “avaliação do processo” do que na “avaliação do resultado”.\n\nCom o objetivo de verificar a capacidade preditiva da “avaliação do processo” e da\n\n“avaliação do resultado” na confiança no parlamento, no Governo, na Presidência da República\n\ne na Justiça, controlando o efeito do “autoposicionamento ideológico”, realizou-se uma análise\n\nde regressão linear hierárquica em dois blocos. No primeiro bloco, foram introduzidas as\n\nvariáveis independentes “avaliação do processo”172 e “avaliação do resultado”173. No segundo\n\nbloco, para além das variáveis mencionadas no primeiro bloco, foi adicionado ao modelo a\n\n172 Índice sintético dos 3 indicadores que medem esta avaliação: i) Processo fácil de compreender; ii) Comissão manteve informado da evolução; iii) Tratamento pela comissão 173 Índice sintético criado pelos três indicadores acima identificados da avaliação dos resultados: i) “Petição devidamente considerada”; ii) “Petição foi um sucesso” e iii) “Satisfação com o resultado da petição”\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

Em segundo lugar, os resultados confirmam em grande\n\nmedida as hipóteses iniciais. Tal como previsto, verifica-se uma relação positiva entre a\n\n“avaliação do processo” e a “confiança nas diferentes instituições” analisadas, confirmando-se,\n\nigualmente, ser esta relação mais forte do que a “avaliação de resultado”. Aliás, os dados\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n198\n\nindicaram que a “avaliação do resultado” não tem capacidade preditiva sobre as VDs –\n\nconfiança no Parlamento, no Governo, na Presidência da República e na Justiça.\n\nEm todos os modelos, a introdução do “autoposicionamento ideológico” teve um\n\nimpacto positivo na variância explicada, uma vez que conduziu a um aumento significativo do\n\nquociente de determinação (R2). Mas não alterou significativamente a relação das VIs com as\n\nVDs, quer no que diz respeito à intensidade quer no que diz respeito ao sentido dessa relação.\n\nNuma análise mais detalhada sobre o impacto da “avaliação do processo” e da\n\n“avaliação do resultado” na confiança nas instituições, é possível observar que, relativamente à\n\nconfiança no Parlamento, o modelo analisado explica 14,0% da variação dos níveis de\n\n“confiança no Parlamento”. A introdução do “autoposicionamento ideológico” traduziu-se num\n\naumento significativo na variância explicada pelo modelo (ΔR2 =0,015; ΔF(1,247) = 4,47;\n\np=.035), que assim passou a ser de 15,2%, mas não alterou a relação entre as VIs e a “confiança\n\nno Parlamento”. A “avaliação do processo”contribui para prever 10,2% da variância dos níveis\n\nde confiança no Parlamento quando controlados os efeitos das restantes variáveis independentes\n\n(R2semi-parcial=0,102). Já a “avaliação do resultado” não tem capacidade preditiva sobre a\n\n“confiança na Parlamento”.\n\nQuanto à “confiança no Governo”, verifica-se que a avaliação que os peticionários fazem\n\ndo processo e do resultado das petições explicam 8,8% da variância associada à “Confiança no\n\nGoverno”. Ainda que reduzido, este valor é estatisticamente significativo. A introdução da VC\n\n“autoposicionamento ideológico” quase duplica a percentagem de variância explicada, subindo,\n\nassim, a capacidade preditiva do modelo para 15,9% (ΔR2 =0,074; ΔF(1,249) =22,189; p=.000),\n\nmas não altera significativamente o impacto de cada uma das VIs nos níveis de confiança no\n\nGoverno. Tal como observado anteriormente, os dados indicam uma relação positiva entre a\n\n“avaliação do processo” e a “confiança no Governo”. Ou seja, quanto melhor a avaliação do\n\nprocesso das petições maior a confiança no Governo. Quando controlado o efeito das restantes\n\nvariáveis independentes, a “avaliação do processo” contribui para explicar 11,0% dos níveis de\n\nconfiança no Governo (R2semi-parcial=0,110). Também neste caso a “avaliação do resultado” não\n\ntem impacto significativo nos níveis de confiança no Governo.\n\nQuando analisada a “confiança na Presidência da Republica” verifica-se que é, de entre\n\ntodas as VDs em análise, a que apresenta menor variância explicada pelo modelo. Estas duas\n\nvariáveis (“avaliação do processo” e “avaliação do resultado”) explicam apenas 5,7% da\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n199\n\nvariância. Ao introduzir no modelo o a variável de controlo – “autoposicionamento ideológico”\n\n-, esse valor duplica para 10,7% (ΔR2 =0,53; ΔF(1,149) = 14,869; p=.000), mas as\n\ncaracterísticas da relação entre as VIs - “avaliação do processo” e “avaliação do resultado” –\n\ncom a “confiança na Presidência da Republica” não se altera significativamente. Ou seja, a\n\navaliação do processo contribui significativamente para prever a confiança na Presidência da\n\nRepública. Quanto melhor a “avaliação do processo” maior a confiança nesta instituição. Já a\n\n“avaliação do resultado” não contribui para prever os níveis de confiança na Presidência da\n\nRepública.\n\nPor último analisamos a relação entre a avaliação dos peticionários (sobre o processo e o\n\nresultado) e a “confiança na Justiça”, controlando, mais uma vez, o “autoposicionamento\n\nideológico”.\n\nO modelo composto pela “avaliação do processo” e “avaliação do resultado” explica\n\n7,1% na variação dos níveis de confiança na Justiça. Quando adicionado ao modelo a VC, o\n\n“autoposicionamento ideológico”, a porção da variância explicada sobe para 8,7%. Ainda que\n\npequeno, este acréscimo é significativo (ΔR2 =0,020; ΔF(1,146) = 5,392; p=.021), no entanto,\n\nnão altera a relação entre as VIs e a VD (“confiança na Justiça”). Uma análise sobre o impacto\n\ndas diferentes variáveis preditoras, indica-nos que, confirmando a tendência observada nos\n\nmodelos anteriores, quanto melhor é a “avaliação do processo” maior são os níveis de\n\n“confiança na Justiça”. Também neste caso o impacto da avaliação do resultado não é\n\nestatisticamente significativo. A “avaliação do processo” tem um impacto de 5,8% na\n\ncapacidade de prever a confiança na justiça quando controlados os efeitos das restantes variáveis\n\nindependentes (R2semi-parcial=0,058).\n\nEm suma, como já foi acima referido, todos os modelos apresentados são adequados\n\npara explicar a relação entre as VIs e as VDs (confiança no Parlamento, no Governo, na\n\nPresidência da Republica e na Justiça). Em todos os casos, verifica-se uma relação positiva entre\n\na “avaliação do processo” das petições e a confiança nas diferentes instituições. Ou seja, quanto\n\nmelhor é a avaliação do processo maior é a confiança nas instituições. A “avaliação do\n\nresultado” parece não condicionar os níveis de confiança em nenhuma das instituições políticas\n\nem estudo, uma vez que em nenhum dos modelos foi possível identificar uma relação\n\nestatisticamente significativa entre esta variável e a confiança nas instituições. A introdução da\n\nvariável de controlo – “autoposicionamento ideológico” - trás um contributo positivo para a\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

O caso português: síntese dos preditores da avaliação dos peticionários e da confiança nas instituições políticas\n\nPrincipais ideias a reter\n\ni. Ainda com base no inquérito realizado aos peticionários, analisou-se por fim a capacidade\n\npreditora de alguns indicadores na avaliação do resultado, tendo os resultados apontado\n\npara que os peticionários que avaliam melhor o processo tendem a fazer uma avaliação\n\nmais positiva do resultado. Era, aliás, esta a nossa expectativa, isto é, que, mais do que\n\nqualquer outro fator, aquele que influencia mais a avaliação do resultado é o juízo do\n\npeticionário acerca do processo da petição.\n\nii. Um dado interessante prende-se com a terceira variável retida pelo modelo utilizado, que\n\nsugere que os peticionários que tinham expectativas mais baixas em relação ao tratamento\n\nda petição são aqueles que acabam por avaliar melhor o resultado desta experiência.\n\nConsideramos que, ainda que de forma algo contra-intuitiva, este resultado tem suporte na\n\nprática e, também, na literatura, quando assinala que expectativas desajustadas e\n\nexageradas dos peticionários em relação ao sistema de petições pode ser gerador de\n\nfrustração com a experiência. A nosso ver, isto pode querer dizer que os peticionários do\n\nsistema português alimentam um excesso de expectativas em relação ao que o sistema\n\npode oferecer, aconselhando porventura a que a Assembleia da República forneça aos\n\ncidadãos informação mais consentânea com o alcance deste direito.\n\niii. Finalmente, pretendemos verificar a capacidade preditora da “avaliação do processo” e da\n\n“avaliação do resultado” na confiança nas instituições políticas, pressupondo que a\n\nexperiência dos peticionários de envolvimento com o parlamento iria influenciar as suas\n\nopiniões sobre esta e outras instituições políticas. A nossa expectativa era, assim, que a\n\navaliação dos peticionários (do processo e do resultado) teria uma relação positiva com a\n\nconfiança nas instituições políticas e que a avaliação do processo teria uma relação mais\n\nforte com a confiança institucional do que a avaliação de resultado. As regressões\n\nrealizadas sugerem que a “avaliação do processo” é a única variável preditora da confiança\n\nno Parlamento, no Governo, na Presidência da República e na Justiça.

Conclusões\n\nEsta tese tinha como ponto de partida dois objetivos fundamentais.\n\nO primeiro consistia em propor um quadro de avaliação do direito de petição que\n\npermitisse avaliar os sistemas de petições de acordo com o que podem e devem oferecer (tendo\n\nem conta os objetivos que prosseguem) e não em função de critérios que não servem este\n\ndireito. Este quadro serviu para respondermos à pergunta central desta tese: em que medida os\n\ndiferentes sistemas de petições têm contribuído para a realização dos seus objetivos?\n\nDesdobrámos esta pergunta em três, que nos ajudaram a responder àquela: i) Têm sido atingidos\n\nos objetivos prosseguidos pelo direito de petição? ii) Que fatores (institucionais, e\n\ncomportamentais) promovem estes objetivos? iii) As novas tecnologias vieram potenciar os\n\nobjetivos do direito de petição, como pretendido?\n\nO segundo grande objetivo decorre do primeiro e passa principalmente pela análise dos\n\nefeitos das recentes reformas de que foi objeto o direito de petição, nomeadamente através das\n\nnovas tecnologias (a chamada modernização do direito de petição), ou seja, conhecer o impacto\n\nda modernização do direito de petição, nomeadamente por via das petições-E, tendo, para o\n\nefeito, escolhido o caso português para avaliar este impacto, por constituir, pela forma como se\n\nmodernizou, um caso privilegiado para o estudo do impacto das petições-E. Com vista a realizar\n\neste objetivo, colocámos quatro perguntas principais a propósito do impacto das petições-E: i)\n\nAfetou o perfil e o comportamento dos peticionários? ii) Afetou a avaliação dos peticionários\n\nacerca do sistema de petições? iii) Afetou o comportamento dos restantes atores do direito de\n\npetição? iv) Como é que a eficácia do sistema de petições da Assembleia da República se\n\nenquadra no contexto dos sistemas de petição comparados?\n\nA partir da avaliação dos peticionários, procurámos finalmente responder a questões\n\nsobre o que influencia aquela avaliação, e, também, qual a capacidade preditora da “avaliação\n\ndo processo” e da “avaliação do resultado” na confiança no parlamento (e noutras instituições\n\npolíticas, como o Governo e a Presidência da República).\n\nPara responder a estas perguntas, seguimos o seguinte plano de tese.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n204\n\nNa Parte I desta investigação, começámos por fazer uma análise da evolução da\n\ninstituição parlamentar, notando, na linha de anteriores estudos de diversos autores (Müller e\n\nSieberer 2014; Leston-Bandeira e Tibúrcio 2015), que uma das principais mudanças ocorridas\n\ndesde há duas décadas a esta parte foi a emergência de, a par das funções tradicionais dos\n\nparlamentos (função legislativa e fiscalizadora), uma função de envolvimento com os cidadãos,\n\nem certa medida recuperando uma função que não lhe é estanha, fazendo lembrar o papel de\n\nintermediação que foi central no tempo dos primeiros parlamentos medievais.\n\nNo desenvolvimento deste papel destacou-se, entre outras iniciativas, a revitalização do\n\ndireito de petição, ele próprio um direito com origens anteriores às democracias constitucionais,\n\nrevitalização que passou em grande parte – embora não exclusivamente - pela associação às\n\nnovas tecnologias. No entanto, notámos ser ainda escassa a informação acerca da eficácia deste\n\ndireito, nomeadamente depois destas transformações mais recentes.\n\nAssim, ainda na Parte I, fizemos uma caracterização do direito de petição, definindo o\n\nseu âmbito de aplicação, salientando que entre os objetivos deste não se encontra o de garantir o\n\nacolhimento da petição, mas antes o de criar condições para que a voz dos cidadãos seja ouvida,\n\nenquadrando-se como uma forma de “advocacy democracy”. De resto, afigura-se como um\n\ndireito convencional, que exige um reduzido esforço quando comparado com as figuras que lhe\n\nsão próximas (como a iniciativa legislativa dos cidadãos ou as iniciativas populares e de\n\nreferendo).\n\nNa Parte II, e depois de considerar brevemente o enquadramento normativo dos vários\n\nsistemas de petições da União Europeia (e, também, da Escócia e do Parlamento Europeu),\n\npropusemos um modelo de avaliação da eficácia destes sistemas, entendido aqui como a\n\nrealização dos objetivos pretendidos por este instrumento de participação democrática dos\n\ncidadãos. Identificámos estes objetivos – tributários da generalidade dos objetivos da\n\ndemocracia (cfr. Dahl 2000), que sistematizámos nos seguintes: i) Feedback e Transparência; ii)\n\nIgualdade e inclusão; iii) Envolvimento dos cidadãos na res publica; iv) Debate e influência; v)\n\nParticipação / Adesão dos cidadãos; vi) Informação e prestação de contas. Deste modo, foi com\n\nbase na realização destes objetivos que avaliámos a eficácia do direito de petição.\n\nCom vista a saber se os objetivos do direito de petição acima mencionados estão a ser\n\nalcançados, operacionalizámos os critérios que permitem uma avaliação empírica e que\n\npretendem ser um espelho das principais características que encontramos nos diversos sistemas\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n205\n\nde petição europeus. Distinguimos estas características em dois grupos: as que dizem respeito ao\n\nquadro jurídico e institucional (que incluem critérios de petições convencionais e de petições\n\neletrónicas), que é mais rígido e estável; e as que se prendem com a forma como os diferentes\n\nintervenientes deste direito se comportam, grupo mais flexível e dinâmico e que pode mudar\n\nmais facilmente.\n\nO modelo de avaliação proposto permitiu respondermos às três perguntas em que\n\ndesdobrámos a pergunta de partida desta tese (“em que medida os diferentes sistemas de\n\npetições têm contribuído para a realização dos seus objetivos?”), isto é: “têm sido atingidos os\n\nobjetivos prosseguidos pelo direito de petição?”, “que fatores - institucionais, comportamentais promovem estes objetivos?” e “as novas tecnologias vieram potenciar os objetivos do direito de\n\npetição, como pretendido?).\n\nAssim, verificámos haver várias ferramentas institucionais que promovem o “feedback”,\n\na “transparência”, o “envolvimento dos cidadãos na res publica” e a “prestação de contas”\n\n(accountability), das quais merecem destaque as relacionadas com as petições-E (em particular,\n\na publicação de petições e a publicação dos principais elementos do processo de petições). Com\n\nefeito, constatámos que estas têm um impacto significativo em vários dos objetivos do direito de\n\npetição, o que deveria constituir um incentivo à sua generalização pelos vários parlamentos\n\neuropeus, o que ainda não é o caso, apesar dos recém modernizados sistemas do Parlamento\n\nEuropeu, no Luxemburgo, em 2014, e no Reino Unido, em 2015. No entanto, realça-se também\n\num forte contributo para importantes objetivos do direito de petição da parte de características\n\ninstitucionais convencionais, como é o caso das audições aos peticionários e os debates, as quais\n\nsão, todavia, amplificadas quando associadas à divulgação e publicidade conferida pelas TIC.\n\nDa análise efetuada, destacaram-se três experiências já consolidadas de sistemas de\n\npetições-E, que oferecem a generalidade das suas funcionalidades: Escócia, Portugal e\n\nAlemanha. Em relação a este último, apontou-se, todavia, uma característica que debilita o seu\n\nimpacto quanto à eficácia deste direito, que consiste na considerável margem de\n\ndiscricionariedade que o Bundestag tem para admitir as petições do sistema de petições-E (as\n\n“petições públicas\"), enfraquecendo este instrumento enquanto direito, o que não acontece na\n\nEscócia ou em Portugal (ou noutros sistemas de petições-E mais recentes, como o Luxemburgo,\n\na Irlanda, o Parlamento Europeu ou o Reino Unido), onde os cidadãos têm a garantia de,\n\nrespeitadas as condições de admissibilidade, verem as suas pretensões entrar no sistema de\n\npetições-E e serem apreciadas pelo Parlamento.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n206\n\nDo lado dos intervenientes no direito de petição, sobressaiu o impacto que as perguntas\n\nfeitas ao Governo, e respetivas respostas, têm em vários dos objetivos deste direito. Estas\n\nobrigam o Governo a tomar posição sobre a questão concreta suscitada pela petição (de que\n\noutra forma os cidadãos têm um poder análogo?), afigurando-se como uma das formas\n\nprivilegiadas de carrear informação para o processo das petições, revestindo-se, assim, como um\n\ndos seus principais retornos (feedback). Do lado do Parlamento, além de suscitar perguntas às\n\nentidades externas (maxime, ao Governo), realça-se a importância de dar uma resposta num\n\nprazo razoável, sem a qual a utilidade deste exercício poderá ser posta em causa.\n\nFinalmente, também identificámos benefícios para os objetivos da \"igualdade\" e\n\n“inclusão” nos sistemas de petições com maior abertura, que admitem petições apresentadas não\n\napenas por nacionais, mas, também, por imigrantes e não residentes. Com efeito, quanto maior\n\nfor esta abertura, maior será a \"inclusão\" dos cidadãos, que assenta na ideia de que, com\n\nexceções mínimas, a todos, ou, pelo menos, à grande maioria dos adultos residentes, deve ser\n\ngarantido que tenham a generalidade dos direitos que definem uma democracia (tal como a\n\ndefiniu Dahl).\n\nDa análise efetuada resulta também que os objetivos prosseguidos pelo direito de petição\n\nconfirmam o entendimento segundo o qual este é, sobretudo, um direito ao procedimento,\n\ncircunstância que determina no essencial a natureza e o alcance deste direito e da qual decorre\n\ndiretamente uma parte importante dos resultados visados por este instrumento de participação,\n\nnomeadamente em termos de maior transparência (obrigação de publicação da tramitação\n\nprocessual, acessível a todos; publicação dos principais documentos, como os relatórios, as\n\nperguntas e respostas feitas a entidades externas como o Governo), mais prestação de contas\n\n(obrigações de resposta às perguntas enviadas a entidades externas, publicadas e\n\ndisponibilizadas a todos) e mais debate (relatório discutido na comissão parlamentar; discussão\n\nem plenário a partir de determinado número de assinaturas).\n\nQuanto à possibilidade de o preenchimento de um critério poder ter um impacto negativo\n\nnos restantes, o maior risco que se identificou foi no critério da “igualdade”, que pode ficar\n\nprejudicado, sobretudo se houver uma sub-representação de alguns segmentos da sociedade na\n\nutilização deste direito, nomeadamente daqueles cidadãos tradicionalmente menos participativos\n\n(como os mais pobres e os menos instruídos). Este é, aliás, o maior risco identificado por\n\nDalton, Scarrow e Cain (2004) em relação às formas de \"advocacy democracy\". Este risco\n\nencontra-se, por isso, associado ao comportamento dos peticionários, podendo os parlamentos\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n207\n\ncontrariá-lo através de iniciativas que promovam este direito junto dos grupos de cidadãos sub representados.\n\nNa Parte III, debruçámo-nos em particular sobre o caso português, por constituir um\n\ncaso privilegiado para o estudo do impacto da modernização por via das petições-E (o segundo\n\ngrande objetivo desta investigação), por o sistema português se ter mantido, no essencial, com\n\nas mesmas características institucionais, embora passando a beneficiar, globalmente, das\n\nfuncionalidades eletrónicas (nomeadamente quanto à publicidade), nisto se distinguindo dos\n\nrestantes exemplos de modernização consolidados.\n\nRecorremos, para o efeito, a uma bateria inédita de dados empíricos sobre o\n\ncomportamento dos atores deste direito durante o período entre 1999 e 2012, nomeadamente\n\natravés de um inquérito aos peticionários portugueses, permitindo integrar mais\n\naprofundadamente a dimensão do perfil dos peticionários e da avaliação destes do sistema de\n\npetições. Desta análise, resultou a avaliação do impacto das petições-E no sistema português,\n\ncontextualizando-o, sempre que possível, com o sistema de petições-E da Escócia e Alemanha,\n\nos dois sistemas que empreenderam uma modernização comparável com o caso português, com\n\nexperiências consolidadas e temporalmente coincidentes.\n\nComeçámos, assim, por procurar a resposta à primeira das quatro questões em que\n\ndesdobrámos a análise do impacto das petições-E no sistema de petições português, a saber, “de\n\nque forma esta reforma afetou o perfil e o comportamento dos peticionários?”.\n\nAssim, aferimos o impacto das petições-E no comportamento dos cidadãos, sobressaindo\n\nnesta análise o impacto que o sistema de petições-E teve ao nível da adesão a este instrumento.\n\nCom efeito, quando comparado com o período em que esteve em vigor o sistema de petições\n\nconvencional, é fácil constatar que o número de petições submetidas à Assembleia da República\n\nmais do que triplicou. Com efeito, passou de uma média de três petições por mês no “sistema\n\nconvencional” (até 2005) para 10 petições por mês no sistema de petições eletrónicas (2005 2012). Esta maior adesão é também confirmada pelos números de assinaturas que foram\n\nrecolhidas pelas petições (que passaram, no mesmo período, de uma média mensal de cerca de\n\n19 mil assinaturas para 39 mil).\n\nVale também a pena realçar que as formas de advocacy democracy, em que se enquadra\n\no direito de petição, comportam, de acordo com a literatura, um risco de desigualdade, de serem\n\nmelhor aproveitadas pelos grupos que já detêm mais influência junto das instituições políticas e\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n208\n\nque tiram mais facilmente proveito destas oportunidades de participação. A presença de um\n\nnúmero significativo de petições singulares, com apenas uma assinatura, sugere que o sistema\n\ntem conseguido, na prática, manter-se aberto à participação de todos os tipos de peticionários,\n\nseja qual for a forma de ação (individual e coletiva), sem que nenhuma tenha adquirido\n\npreponderância no sistema de petições, beneficiando a eficácia do sistema, nomeadamente na\n\nsua dimensão de “igualdade e inclusão”.\n\nEm relação aos restantes indicadores do comportamento dos peticionários, sublinhe-se\n\nainda que, apesar da dupla função do direito de petição (para prossecução de um interesse\n\nparticular ou geral), os peticionários têm usado preferencialmente este direito para prosseguir o\n\ninteresse geral, convocando diretamente as competências (legislativa ou de controlo) da AR,\n\ntraduzindo-se, assim, num exercício mais eficaz deste direito, convocando as principais\n\ncompetências do parlamento, garantindo assim um maior “feedback”, promovendo mais “debate\n\ne influência” deste instrumento, maior “envolvimento dos cidadãos com a res publica” e, assim,\n\nreforçando também a “igualdade e inclusão dos cidadãos”. Apesar de a percentagem de petições\n\nque prosseguem o interesse geral se ter mantido (registo que já era, no sistema anterior, muito\n\nelevado - em torno dos 90%), verificámos que o impacto das petições-E foi positivo, por ser de\n\nesperar que a maior informalidade na submissão das petições (nomeadamente podendo\n\nsubmeter-se petições por E-mail), bem como o aumento das petições singulares no sistema de\n\npetições-E, levasse a um aumento das petições-queixa, que prosseguem interesses particulares, o\n\nque não aconteceu.\n\nUm dos objetivos da modernização do direito de petição consiste em atrair para a esfera\n\nda participação política grupos de cidadãos tradicionalmente menos propensos a este tipo de\n\nparticipação. Os dados recolhidos através do inquérito aos peticionários parecem mostrar que\n\neste objetivo foi mais bem sucedido nalgumas dimensões do que noutras.\n\nAssim, verificámos um impacto positivo ao nível da capacidade de atrair cidadãos mais\n\njovens, aproximando o perfil dos peticionários da média de idades da população portuguesa. De\n\nigual modo, o sistema de petições-E parece ter conseguido atrair cidadãos menos habituados à\n\nparticipação política e menos identificados com os partidos com representação parlamentar, indo\n\nassim ao encontro de uma representação mais fidedigna da população portuguesa.\n\nIdentificámos ainda uma evolução positiva ao nível do autoposicionamento ideológico\n\ndos peticionários, mitigando uma sobre-representação (ainda existente) dos peticionários de\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n209\n\nesquerda, em benefício dos que se situam ao centro e à direita, aproximando, assim, o seu perfil\n\ndo da população portuguesa.\n\nAo nível dos restantes indicadores habitualmente usados para caracterizar socio demograficamente os cidadãos, o impacto não foi, de um modo geral, significativo. Foi o que\n\naconteceu ao nível da origem geográfica, do sexo ou da situação profissional dos peticionários\n\n(permanecendo uma sobre-representação muito significativa dos homens, da zona de Lisboa, em\n\nsituação ativa). Também se continua a verificar, em comparação com o sistema anterior, uma\n\nsobre-representação dos peticionários com formação superior, embora aqui a hipótese para que\n\napontava a literatura era que esta oportunidade de participação seria melhor aproveitada pelos\n\ncidadãos com mais recursos sociais, nomeadamente educativos, o que se verifica apenas\n\nparcialmente. Com efeito, o impacto da entrada em vigor do sistema de petições-E reflete um\n\ncrescimento significativo das petições oriundas de cidadãos com um nível de instrução\n\nintermédio (12 anos de escolaridade), o que aconteceu à custa de uma diminuição do peso dos\n\npeticionários com nove ou menos anos de escolaridade, bem como de uma ligeira diminuição do\n\npeso dos que têm formação superior.\n\nDe um modo geral, o impacto das petições-E ao nível do perfil dos peticionários na\n\neficácia do sistema foi positivo, tendo o maior contributo sido ao nível de uma maior “igualdade\n\ne inclusão” e “envolvimento na res publica” de grupos da população sub-representados entre os\n\npeticionários. Na generalidade dos restantes casos, não os afetou. É, no entanto, de sublinhar a\n\nausência de impacto das petições-E ao nível de dois dos indicadores do perfil dos peticionários\n\nque acusam um maior enviesamento em relação à população portuguesa: o sexo (com sobre representação masculina) e a origem geográfica (com sobre-representação da região de Lisboa)\n\ndos peticionários. Esta é uma situação que deveria merecer a atenção da Assembleia da\n\nRepública com vista a ser mitigada, nomeadamente através de políticas específicamente\n\ndirigidas às populações sub-representadas.\n\nProcurámos, de seguida, a resposta à questão de saber como é que as petições-E\n\n“afetaram o comportamento dos restantes atores (além dos cidadãos) do direito de petição (i.e.,\n\no Governo e o Parlamento)”.\n\nTodos os indicadores referentes ao comportamento do Governo e da Assembleia da\n\nRepública revelaram um impacto positivo da introdução do sistema de petições-E. Mesmo com\n\no aumento muito significativo de petições que se seguiu a 2005, a Assembleia da República\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n210\n\nrespondeu diminuindo muito consideravelmente o tempo de apreciação das petições\n\n(tradicionalmente, um dos principais calcanhares de Aquiles deste direito), ao mesmo tempo que\n\nquestionou mais vezes o Governo sobre as petições.\n\nDo mesmo modo, e defrontando-se com o mesmo aumento do número de petições, o\n\nGoverno passou a responder a mais perguntas, diminuindo o tempo em que o fez, contribuindo\n\nassim para que o processo das petições fosse enriquecido com informação deste órgão,\n\ninformação que a generalidade dos peticionários dificilmente conseguiria obter por outra via.\n\nAssim, verificámos a este nível um impacto muito positivo quanto ao “feedback”,\n\n“igualdade e inclusão”, “transparência” e “prestação de contas”, bem como em relação ao\n\n“debate e influência, tendo todos estes crirérios saído reforçados com o sistema de petições-E\n\n(conforme mostrámos no quadro 5.4).\n\nGlobalmente considerado, o impacto das petições-E no sistema de petições português\n\nrevelou-se claramente positivo, amplificando importantes objetivos do direito de petição, tanto\n\nao nível do enquadramento institucional como do comportamento dos seus principais atores,\n\nestabelecendo um contraste pela positiva em relação ao anterior sistema (convencional) de\n\npetições em vigor ao nível da sua eficácia, mas também em relação à generalidade dos sistemas\n\nde petições europeus, e acompanhando, no essencial, os sistemas que mais e melhor se\n\nmodernizaram (a partir dos anos 2000) no que a este direito diz respeito.\n\nContudo, a melhoria verificada com a introdução do sistema de petições-E não deve\n\nescamotear algumas debilidades que continuam a afetar a eficácia deste sistema, nomeadamente\n\nos contrastes que persistem entre o perfil dos peticionários portugueses e o da população em\n\ngeral, dos quais podemos destacar a gritante sobre-representação dos peticionários da região de\n\nLisboa, dos homens ou dos peticionários que possuem formação superior. Este problema é,\n\naliás, partilhado pelos parlamentos da Escócia e da Alemanha, ambos com sistemas de petições E consolidados, com experiências temporalmente coincidentes com a experiência portuguesa.\n\nEstas grandes diferenças nos dados sobre o perfil dos peticionários dos três países aqui\n\nanalisados em relação às respetivas populações põem, aliás, em causa a ideia generalizada de\n\nque as petições são como um espelho da opinião pública e da sociedade em que se inserem. O\n\nBundestag chama o sistema de petições de “barómetro da opinião pública”174 e a mesma ideia\n\npode ser encontrada em membros da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento (Carman 2006).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n211\n\nContudo, existe uma parte importante da sociedade que não se encontra representada nos\n\nsistemas de petições, e outra parte que tem uma presença exagerada. Como tal, as questões que\n\nsão discutidas no sistema de petições refletirão, necessariamente, esta dissonância. Mitigar esta\n\nsituação constitui, a nosso ver, um dos principais desafios que se colocam aos sistemas de\n\npetições interessados em reforçar os laços com a sociedade por esta via.\n\nFinalmente, utilizámos os dados do inquérito feito aos peticionários para analisar “quais\n\nos preditores estatísticos da “avaliação dos peticionários”, a quinta questão que colocámos\n\nacima a propósito do estudo do sistema de petições português.\n\nAssim, analisou-se a capacidade preditora de alguns indicadores na “avaliação do\n\nresultado”, daí se retirando que os peticionários que avaliam melhor o “processo” tendem a\n\nfazer uma avaliação mais positiva do “resultado”. Era, aliás, esta a nossa expectativa, isto é, que,\n\nmais do que qualquer outro fator, aquele que influenciaria mais a avaliação do resultado seria o\n\njuízo do peticionário acerca do processo da petição, como tinha, aliás, mostrado Carman em\n\nrelação ao sistema de petições escocês.\n\nO modelo utilizado apontou também para que os peticionários que tinham expectativas\n\nmais baixas em relação ao tratamento da petição são aqueles que acabam por avaliar melhor o\n\nresultado desta experiência, resultado que tem suporte na prática e, também, na literatura,\n\nquando assinala que expectativas desajustadas e exageradas dos peticionários em relação ao\n\nsistema de petições pode ser gerador de frustração com a experiência. Ou seja, embora as\n\nexpectativas dos peticionários possam ser totalmente enquadráveis no âmbito deste direito e na\n\nmissão que a lei lhe atribui, poderão constituir um problema se esta confiança mascarar outras\n\nexpectativas, como, por exemplo, em relação a um acolhimento da pretensão, que possam ser\n\ndesajustadas em relação ao que este direito pode, com probabilidade, oferecer. Nesse caso, estas\n\nexpectativas correm o risco de se transformar em frustração, por as mesmas assentarem, de\n\nalgum modo, num desejo em grande medida irrealizável (pelo menos, para a esmagadora\n\nmaioria dos peticionários). Isto deve, a nosso ver, convidar a Assembleia da República a\n\ntrabalhar na informação que disponibiliza sobre este instrumento, adequando-o ao que, com\n\nprobabilidade, o peticionário pode esperar dele. Por exemplo, sendo possível que uma petição\n\nimpulsione um projeto de lei (ou mesmo uma lei), isto não é o que é provável acontecer,\n\ncabendo à AR garantir que os cidadãos têm consciência disto, fornecendo-lhes informação mais\n\nconsentânea com o alcance deste direito. Coerentemente, o modelo mostrou também que os\n\n174 http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/committees/a02\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n212\n\npeticionários que não tinham expectativas tão altas sobre o tratamento da petição acabaram por\n\nse revelar mais satisfeitos com o resultado deste exercício.\n\nEm relação à última questão que presidiu a esta investigação - de saber “qual a\n\ncapacidade preditora da ‘avaliação do processo’ e da ‘avaliação do resultado’ na confiança no\n\nparlamento (e noutras instituições políticas, como o Governo e a Presidência da República) ” -, a\n\nnossa expectativa era que a avaliação dos peticionários sobre o processo das petições teria uma\n\nrelação positiva com a confiança nas instituições políticas, o que, de facto, se verificou. Ou seja,\n\nmostrou-se que quanto melhor é a “avaliação do processo” pelo peticionário, maior é a\n\nconfiança nas instituições políticas. A “avaliação do resultado” parece não condicionar os níveis\n\nde confiança em nenhuma das instituições políticas em estudo, uma vez que em nenhum dos\n\nmodelos foi possível identificar uma relação estatisticamente significativa entre esta variável e a\n\nconfiança nas instituições. A introdução da variável de controlo – “autoposicionamento\n\nideológico” - trouxe um contributo positivo para a capacidade preditiva de todos os modelos. No\n\nentanto, não influenciou a relação entre a avaliação, quer do processo, quer do resultado, com a\n\nconfiança nas diversas instituições politicas analisadas.\n\nDe tudo o que foi exposto, não podemos dizer, naturalmente, que tenhamos esgotado\n\ntodas as dimensões passíveis de contribuir para uma avaliação da eficácia dos sistemas de\n\npetições. A opção de incluir ou excluir um determinado critério é isso mesmo - uma escolha,\n\nmesmo que justificada -, e, como tal, sempre suscetível de ser contrariada. Por outro lado,\n\npoder-se-á, também, dizer que fomos longe demais no desdobramento de critérios para avaliar\n\num direito que, apesar de tudo, prima pela simplicidade. É verdade que um critério único como\n\no do acolhimento do pedido facilitaria enormemente a tarefa.Todavia, o acolhimento da\n\npretensão dos cidadaos não é um objetivo contemplado pelos sistemas de petição em causa.\n\nAssim, um dos principais desafios a que aqui pretendemos responder foi o de desenvolver\n\ninstrumentos que permissem medir, na prática, a eficácia do direito de petição, tendo em conta\n\nas particularidades deste instrumento, nomeadamente a sua natureza essencialmente\n\nprocedimental. Chegados aqui, pensamos ter conseguido fazê-lo.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n227\n\nANEXO A: Breve descrição dos sistemas de petição na UE (mais Escócia e PE) Alemanha\n\nO direito de petição encontra consagração na Constituição da Alemanha (arts. 17, 17a e\n\n45c), que o enquadra como direito fundamental. Nestes artigos prevê-se que as petições sejam\n\ntratadas pelo Parlamento alemão por uma Comissão de Petições especificamente dedicada para\n\no efeito. Devem ser reduzidas a escrito e podem ser exercidas individual ou coletivamente, tanto\n\npara prosseguir interesses privados (queixas) como de interesse público. Contrariamente ao que\n\nse passa na esmagadora maioria dos países da UE, a Alemanha não contempla a figura do\n\nOmbudsman a nível nacional175, sendo de certa forma a Comissão de Petições do Bundestag a\n\ndesempenhar esse papel. Esta circunstância acaba por explicar algumas das singularidades do\n\nsistema de petições alemão, principalmente o número de petições elevado que são submetidas\n\nanualmente (contando a Comissão de Petições com um staff de cerca de 80 funcionários). Desde\n\n2005, existem dois tipos de petições: as “convencionais”, que mantêm no essencial a mesma\n\nconfiguração e processo que vinha de trás, e as “petições públicas”, que gozam de prerrogativas\n\nadicionais, como as da publicidade no site do Parlamento, ou originarem um debate público,\n\nassim como a audição dos peticionários. As petições convencionais podem ser apresentadas por\n\ncorreio ou por E-mail. Todavia, as “petições públicas” só podem ser submetidas online. Os\n\nmenores podem apresentar petições.\n\nÁustria\n\nNo caso austríaco, o termo “petição” é usado para as questões que são apresentadas por\n\num Deputado, enquanto uma petição submetida por um indivíduo é designada “Iniciativa dos\n\nCidadãos”. O direito de petição para todos é estabelecido no artigo 11 da Lei Fundamental de 21\n\nde dezembro de 1867. O direito de petição é um direito de todos. Para serem apreciadas, as\n\nPetições (incitativas legislativas) devem ser apoiadas por pelo menos 500 cidadãos austríacos\n\ncom mais de 16 anos (tendo o primeiro signatário de ser eleitor176 – outros requisitos são a\n\napresentação por escrito e a identificação de todos os signatários), um caso único no contexto\n\neuropeu de exigência de quórum para submissão de petições parlamentares. As petições são\n\napreciadas pela Comissão de Petições e de Iniciativas Cívicas. O artigo 100 do Regimento do\n\n175 Nos países da UE, além da Alemanha, apenas a Itália não tem um Ombudsman nacional. 176 Na Áustria, tem-se o direito de voto a partir dos 16 anos (desde 2007).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n228\n\nConselho Nacional (câmara baixa do Parlamento) descreve o processo de tratamento das\n\npetições:\n\nBélgica\n\nA constituição belga prevê o direito de petição nos artigos 28 e 57, garantindo o direito\n\nde qualquer cidadão poder apresentar petições ao Parlamento. As duas Câmaras (Senado e\n\nCâmara dos Representantes) apreciam autonomamente petições, tanto em Plenário como nas\n\ncomissões competentes. Só a câmara baixa tem uma comissão especializada para tratar petições:\n\na Comissão de Petições. Em relação ao direito de petição perante a câmara baixa, o regimento\n\nda câmara dos representantes regula-o nos artigos 142-144. São admitidas petições individuais\n\n(uma assinatura) e coletivas (uma pluralidade de assinaturas). O peticionário recebe, no final,\n\ninformação sobre o destino da petição. O site da câmara dos representantes disponibiliza\n\ninformação sobre o enquadramento deste direito177. A informação sobre as petições (autor e\n\nresposta da comissão de petições) é publicada nos chamados Feuilleton des pétitions178. Os\n\nparlamentos regionais (Flandres, Valónia e Bruxelas-capital) também preveem o direito de\n\npetição.\n\nBulgária\n\nDe acordo com o artigo 45 da constituição búlgara, os cidadãos têm o direito de\n\napresentar queixas, fazer propostas e submeter petições perante os órgãos do Estado. Os\n\nassuntos das petições devem ser de interesse geral para a comunidade e enquadrar-se nas\n\ncompetências do parlamento. A petição deve ser reduzida a escrito. A Comissão de Petições\n\ndeve responder por escrito aos peticionários, não sendo apreciadas as petições anónimas. Se lhes\n\nfor solicitado, os organismos públicos, funcionários e cidadãos são obrigados a comparecer\n\nperante a Comissão e apresentar os documentos necessários relativos à petição.\n\nChipre\n\nO parlamento do chipre não prevê um processo para as petições.\n\nDinamarca\n\nO regimento do parlamento da Dinamarca prevê, na secção 25, que as petições podem\n\nser apresentadas ao Parlamento dinamarquês apenas através de um dos seus membros (Seção 54\n\n177 http://www.lachambre.be/accessible/laChambre_petition.htm\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n229\n\nda Constituição). Não existe, todavia, procedimento previsto para a apreciação de petições (é,\n\npor isso, um sistema bastante informal), sendo este instrumento raramente usado.\n\nEscócia\n\nO direito de petição perante o Parlamento da Escócia foi criado em 1999, no mesmo ano\n\nem que foi criado este parlamento, na sequência do processo de devolução de poderes do Reino\n\nUnido. Este sistema de petições baseou-se, desde o seu início, em grande parte nos meios\n\neletrónicos. Este sistema beneficia tanto as petições submetidas por e-mail como as mais\n\nconvencionais - por correio postal -, uma vez que todas são publicadas na Internet e o seu exame\n\n(processo de tomada de decisão) pode ser acompanhado e monitorizado no site do Parlamento\n\nescocês. Qualquer pessoa pode submeter petições, mesmo que não residente na Escócia e não\n\nsendo nacional deste país. As informações mais relevantes do processo encontram-se\n\ndisponíveis online, tal como o número de assinaturas da petição, documentos relacionados e as\n\natas das reuniões em que a petição foi discutida. As funcionalidades eletrónicas incluem a\n\npossibilidade de submeter petições ou assinar online petições já submetidas.\n\nEmbora não seja obrigatório, a realização de debates e audições aos peticionários\n\nconstituem prática comum, independentemente do número de assinaturas na petição. O site\n\ntambém inclui uma grande variedade de material de informação, tal como texto, folhetos e\n\nvídeos de animação, disponível em várias línguas (incluindo árabe, bengali, punjabi, chinês\n\nsimplificado / mandarim, ou Urdu), em que se explica ao público o funcionamento do sistema\n\nde petições, da submissão e do seu exame (apreciação) até à decisão final.\n\nO Regimento do Parlamento escocês prevê, nos artigos 6.10, e 15.4-15.8, as principais\n\nregras sobre o exame das petições.\n\nEslováquia\n\nO direito de petição encontra-se regulado na Lei No. 85/1990, que, em conformidade\n\ncom a constituição eslovaca, garante o direito de petição a todos. Pode ser exercido individual\n\nou coletivamente, por carta ou entregue em mão. Não existe uma Comissão especificamente\n\ndedicada ao tratamento das petições. Quando a petição envolva poderes que ultrapassam os\n\npoderes do parlamento, este reencaminha a petição para o ministério competente. São aceites\n\npetições coletivas e em nome de entidades coletivas. Embora não decorra especificamente da lei,\n\ntem sido entendimento do parlamento que as petições tenham mais de uma assinatura para\n\n178 Exemplo de Feuilleton des pétitions: http://www.lachambre.be/FLWB/PDF/52/2086/52K2086001.pdf\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n230\n\nmerecerem o tratamento como petição (isto é, não são consideradas as petições com apenas uma\n\nassinatura). O pedido das petições não pode resultar numa violação dos direitos e liberdades\n\nfundamentais ou interferir com a independência dos tribunais. Todos os signatários têm de\n\nassinar a petição, indicar o nome e a residência.\n\nEslovénia\n\nO direito de petição tem consagração no artigo 45.º do texto constitucional. As petições\n\nsão tratadas por uma Comissão de Petições. As petições podem ser submetidas diretamente,\n\nindividualmente (uma assinatura) ou coletivamente, também podendo ser submetidas por\n\nentidades coletivas: associações, sindicatos, etc. As petições podem ser apresentadas por escrito\n\n– são-no, habitualmente – mas também podem ser submetidas oralmente, sendo ulteriormente\n\nreduzidas a escrito.\n\nEspanha\n\nO direito de petição encontra-se regulado no na Constituição espanhola (Art. 77; Art.\n\n29), no regimento Congresso (secção 49) e na Lei Orgânica 4/2001. De acordo com este quadro\n\nlegal, o direito de petição pode ser exercido diretamente, sem necessidade de intermediação de\n\num membro do Congresso. Pode ser exercido individual ou coletivamente. São poucas as\n\ncondições exigidas para a submissão de petições: reduzir a escrito, assinatura, nome e morada\n\ndos peticionários. Tanto cidadãos espanhóis como estrangeiros podem exercer este direito (cfr.\n\nSecção 1 da lei orgânica). Ademais, é um direito das pessoas individuais, mas também das\n\npessoas coletivas. A lei orgânica prevê o envio de petições por via eletrónica, desde que a\n\nidentidade do peticionário possa ser verificada. As petições são apreciadas pela Comissão de\n\nPetições, que pode solicitar o parecer da comissão materialmente competente, remetê-las aos\n\nGrupos Parlamentares se for necessária uma iniciativa legislativa ou reencaminhá-la para outro\n\nórgão de soberania ou qualquer entidade competente. A Comissão de Petições pode realizar\n\naudições parlamentares ou solicitar o parecer de peritos.\n\nEstónia\n\nApesar de o artigo 46 da Constituição da Estónia versar sobre o direito de petição,\n\ndefinido com um direito perante qualquer organismo do estado e Governo local, não existe\n\nqualquer procedimento específico regulado para o parlamento estónio (Riigikogu).\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n231\n\nFinlândia\n\nO Parlamento finlandês não possui um sistema de petições.\n\nFrança\n\nNão existe qualquer exigência de mínimo de assinaturas, podendo a petição ser\n\napresentada por um único cidadão ou por um coletivo de cidadãos. Os artigos 147.º a 151 do\n\nRegimento da Assembleia Nacional (câmara baixa) definem as condições de registo e exame\n\ndas petições. Assim, as petições devem ser dirigidas ao presidente do parlamento. Depois de\n\nserem registadas, as petições são encaminhadas para a comissão de leis constitucionais, da\n\nlegislação e administração geral da República. As petições admitidas são inscritas num rol de\n\npetições, que é, em princípio, examinado duas vezes por sessão legislativa pela comissão\n\nreferida. O relator examina o conjunto das petições, que pode concluir por uma das seguintes\n\nvias: o arquivamento da petição; o reencaminhamento a uma outra comissão competente, a um\n\nministro ou ao Mediador da República (Ombudsman); a submissão da petição à Assembleia\n\nNacional. Podem ser solicitadas informações a qualquer entidade. As petições podem ser\n\napresentadas diretamente, sem intermediação, mas é possível que um deputado adote uma\n\npetição, depositando-a. Qualquer Deputado ou o Governo podem solicitar ao Presidente da\n\nAssembleia que essa petição seja debatida em Plenário. A Conferência dos Presidentes delibera\n\nsobre esse agendamento. O exame das petições dá origem, periodicamente, à publicação de um\n\nfeuilleton destinado aos Deputados, resumindo os pedidos, a respetiva decisão da Comissão\n\nparlamentar e, se for o caso, a resposta a esta última.\n\nGrécia\n\nDe acordo com o Regulamento do parlamento Helénico, qualquer pessoa pode,\n\nindividual ou coletivamente, submeter petições, que podem ser patrocinadas por um Deputado\n\nou dirigidas diretamente ao Presidente do Parlamento (artigo 125, n.º1). As petições devem\n\nmencionar o nome, profissão, a capacidade e o endereço de quem os assinar (artigo 125, n.º2). O\n\nmesmo artigo do regimento prevê o envio de petições ao ministro competente (sendo esse o\n\ncaso), o qual deve responder ao parlamento no prazo de 25 dias.\n\nHungria\n\nO direito de petição na Hungria encontra-se regulado na Constituição (Artigo XXV), que\n\ndispõe que \"qualquer pessoa tem o direito de apresentar um pedido escrito, reclamação ou\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n232\n\nproposta, seja individual ou coletiva, a qualquer órgão que exerça poder público”. A petição\n\npode ser submetida oralmente ou por escrito, podendo ser entregue em papel ou por meios\n\neletrónicos. As petições são reencaminhadas para a Comissão parlamentar competente ou órgão\n\ncompetente, que deve responder ao peticionário. De acordo com o Regimento (artigo 136/2), as\n\npetições devem ser registadas, o que é feito de forma eletrónica desde 2011 (antes, o registo era\n\nfeito manualmente). Este registo inclui as medidas tomadas, estando, porém, o mesmo apenas\n\nacessível aos deputados.\n\nIrlanda\n\nLargamente inspirado pela experiência escocesa, a Irlanda introduziu um sistema de\n\npetições em 2012. As petições podem ser submetidas às câmaras do Oireachtas, desde que sobre\n\num assunto de interesse geral e enquadrável nas competências legislativas do Oireachtas.\n\nPodem apresentar petições tanto indivíduos como entes coletivos. Existe uma Comissão\n\nhabilitada para tratar petições (Joint Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions). Os\n\nmembros do Governo podem ser convidados a assistir às reuniões da Comissão e a responder a\n\nquestões sobre a petição; a petição pode ser reencaminhada para a Comissão Conjunta\n\ncompetente para uma análise mais aprofundada. A Comissão pode recomendar que uma questão\n\nsuscitada por uma petição seja debatida na câmara. As petições podem ser submetidas\n\neletronicamente, o que não exclui, de modo algum, que possam ser apresentadas por meios\n\ntradicionais (papel).\n\nItália\n\nAs regras sobre petições estão há muito consagradas. As petições podem ser submetidas\n\npor um ou mais peticionários (também por entes coletivos), podendo ser submetidas diretamente\n\npelos cidadãos ou por intermédio de um Deputado. A apresentação deve ser feita por escrito,\n\ndirigida ao Presidente do Parlamento, identificando o peticionário e a sua residência. Não são\n\nadmitidas petições com fins exclusivamente particulares (artigo 50 da constituição italiana),\n\ndevendo, por isso, visar um interesse comum a vários cidadãos. Uma vez admitida, as petições\n\nsão enviadas para a comissão parlamentar competente, junto da qual cada deputado pode tomar\n\ndelas conhecimento (artigo 33 e artigo 109 do regimento da câmara dos deputados). Do exame\n\nda petição pode resultar uma resolução com o objetivo de sensibilizar o Governo para a\n\npretensão do peticionário ou uma iniciativa legislativa.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n233\n\nLetónia\n\nO direito de petição está consagrado na constituição da Letónia (artigo 104), dispondo\n\nque todos têm o direito de submeter petições às instituições do Estado e ao governo local, bem\n\ncomo a receber uma resposta sobre a essência da questão. As petições podem ser submetidas ao\n\nparlamento (Saeima) diretamente, sem intermediação de um deputado. Podem ser enviadas por\n\ncorreio e através de meios eletrónicos (e-mail). As petições podem ser assinadas apenas por um\n\nindivíduo (ou pessoa coletiva), devendo o pedido ser reduzido a escrito (na língua oficial) e\n\nprosseguir o interesse geral (podendo incidir sobre qualquer assunto).\n\nLituânia (Seimas)\n\nO direito de petição encontra-se consagrado na Constituição e o seu procedimento\n\nregulado na lei de petições da República da Lituânia - VIII-1313, 7.07.1999, definindo o seu\n\nprocedimento. Segundo a lei de petições (artigo 7.º), as petições podem ser submetidas\n\ndiretamente pelo peticionário, em pessoa, através dos correios ou por correio eletrónico,\n\ndevendo o Seimas apreciar os pedidos que se enquadrem nas suas competências (desde que não\n\nproponham restrições aos direitos e liberdades das pessoas, possam ameaçar a independência ou\n\na integridade territorial ou a ordem constitucional da Lituânia). As petições são tratadas pela\n\nComissão de Petições. As petições podem ser individuais (uma única assinatura) ou coletivas\n\n(duas ou mais assinaturas), havendo um peso considerável das petições apresentadas por um\n\núnico cidadão179. Segundo o artigo 2.º da lei de petições, podem submeter petições qualquer\n\ncidadão lituano ou estrangeiro a residir em permanência no país. A idade mínima para submeter\n\numa petição é 16 anos. A petição tem de conter o nome e apelido, local de residência e número\n\nde identidade, devendo ser assinada (no caso das petições submetidas eletronicamente, estas têm\n\nde conter uma assinatura digital).\n\nLuxemburgo\n\nAs petições podem ser apresentadas por um ou mais indivíduos, não podendo ter por\n\nobjeto interesses particulares. Existem dois tipos de petições: as petições ordinárias e as petições\n\npúblicas. As “petições ordinárias” são apreciadas na Comissão de Petições, que deve responder\n\nao peticionário. Para a apreciação, a Comissão habitualmente solicita que o ministro competente\n\nse pronuncie, pode ouvir os peticionários ou realizar deslocações no quadro da instrução da\n\n179 Segundo o relatório anual de 2011 da Comissão de Petições do Parlamento Lituano.\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa.

O peticionário é informado por correio das diligências da Comissão de Petições,\n\nestando esta informação disponível ao público no site do parlamento. Estas petições tanto\n\npodem ser submetidas por correio como por E-mail. As “petições públicas” são publicadas no\n\nsite do Parlamento com vista à recolha de assinaturas (durante 42 dias). Se conseguir recolher\n\n4.500 assinaturas, a petição é debatida na Comissão de Petições, com a presença dos\n\npeticionários e do membro do Governo a que a petição diga respeito. Este debate é transmitido\n\nno canal do parlamento. As petições que não alcancem as 4.500 assinaturas podem ser tratadas\n\ncomo petições ordinárias. Nas petições públicas, tanto a submissão como toda a comunicação\n\nentre o peticionário e o parlamento é feita através da plataforma, estando excluídos os restantes\n\nmeio (correios, E-mail, etc.). A idade mínima para submeter uma petição é 15 anos. No\n\nmomento da submissão, o peticionário deve fundamentar a razão da petição ser considerada de\n\ninteresse público.\n\nMalta\n\nO Sistema de petições de Malta exigia que as petições fossem submetidas através de um\n\nDeputado. Contudo, isto deixou de estar previsto no regimento em 2016 (através da Resolution\n\n382 de 2016), embora também possam ser submetidas através de Deputados. No entanto,\n\nconsultado (em julho de 2016) o site do parlamento maltês é possível constatar que, na\n\nlegislatura que se iniciou em 2013, só estão registadas duas petições, ambas submetidas por um\n\nmembro do parlamento em nome de cidadãos malteses. Não existe limite mínimo de assinaturas.\n\nOs artigos 140 a 150 do regimento regulam a matéria das petições. Desde 2016 que as petições\n\nsão tratadas por uma Comissão de Petições. As petições podem ser submetidas por correio ou\n\npor formulário eletrónico (na verdade, apenas estas não carecem de intermediação de um\n\ndeputado). Após a apreciação pela Comissão de Petições, esta decide se a petição deverá ser\n\nencaminhada para uma comissão parlamentar permanente ou se a discussão deve ser realizada\n\nem reunião plenária. A petição pode também ser encaminhada para um Ministério.\n\nPaíses Baixos\n\nO direito de petição tem acolhimento na Constituição, no seu artigo 5. Tanto a câmara\n\nbaixa como a câmara alta tratam de petições, tendo ambas uma Comissão de Petições. Estas\n\ncomissões tratam tanto das petições como das iniciativas dos cidadãos (existem dois tipo de\n\npetições: as verzoekschriften, que são, na prática, queixas particulares relacionadas com a ação\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n235\n\ndo Governo; e as iniciativas dos cidadãos, que não são reguladas pelo regimento – Petities - e\n\nque dizem respeito às políticas públicas, isto é, questões de interesse geral). As petições podem\n\nser submetidas diretamente e basta uma assinatura.\n\nPolónia\n\nA Polónia não prevê o direito de petição perante a câmara baixa. No entanto, prevê este\n\ndireito perante o Senado.\n\nPortugal\n\nO direito de petição está previsto na Constituição e na Lei do Exercício do Direito de\n\npetição, podendo ser exercido por carta ou por via eletrónica. O regime legal, bem como os\n\naspetos institucionais chave e o comportamento dos principais atores deste direito são\n\ndesenvolvidos na Parte II e III deste trabalho. A lei das petições garante uma série de direitos a\n\nqualquer peticionário, mesmo que submeta uma petição com apenas uma assinatura. Assim,\n\nqualquer petição é publicada no site (mesmo as apresentadas em papel), assim como o respetivo\n\nprocedimento, sendo a petição objeto de um relatório de um Deputado, o qual é discutido e\n\nvotado na comissão competente em razão da matéria. A partir de determinados limiares, os\n\npeticionários também têm a direito a ser ouvidos no Parlamento (1000 assinaturas) e a ver a\n\npetição discutida em reunião plenária (4000 assinaturas). Estes direitos são garantidos por lei,\n\nnão estando sujeitos a qualquer apreciação discricionária por parte do Parlamento.\n\nReino Unido\n\nO Reino Unido tem um novo sistema de petições (eletrónicas) desde 2015, que se\n\ndistingue do sistema convencional por estar mais vocacionado para questões nacionais (ao passo\n\nque o convencional pretende ser mais focado em assuntos locais, sendo apenas aceites\n\nassinaturas escritas, carecendo do patrocínio de um membro do Parlamento). Com este sistema,\n\nfoi criada uma Comissão de Petições (previamente inexistente). As novas regras estabelecem\n\num limiar de 100.000 assinaturas para que a petição seja considerada para um debate. Com\n\n10.000 assinaturas, a petição recebe, obrigatoriamente, uma resposta do Governo.\n\nRepública Checa\n\nAs petições podem ser apresentadas a qualquer órgão do Estado, incluindo o Parlamento\n\n- Câmara dos Deputados ou do Senado. (artigo 18 da Carta dos Direitos e Liberdades\n\nA eficácia dos sistemas de petições na Europa. A modernização do caso português, em particular\n\n236\n\nFundamentais e Act No. 85/1990, sobre o direito de petição).

Nevertheless, it remains unclear what people want from parliamentary decision-making. In this study, we test the impact of outcome favourability, actor involvement and justiﬁcations on the perceived legitimacy of a parliamentary decision-making process on euthanasia in Finland. We do so with the help of a survey experiment (n ¼ 1243), where respondents were exposed to a vignette where the treatments varied randomly. The results suggest that outcome favourability is of primary importance, but the involvement of experts and citizens also boost legitimacy in the eyes of citizens. Justiﬁcations, or presenting arguments for the decisions, does not enhance legitimacy and may even cause a backﬁre mechanism where the difference between getting and not getting the preferred outcome is ampliﬁed.\n\nKeywords: Decision-making, Legitimacy, Parliament, Representation, Survey experiment, Euthanasia\n\nThere is widespread agreement that citizenries are growing increasingly dissatisﬁed with traditional political forms of representative decision-making. However, different bodies of literature point in somewhat different directions regarding the potential sources of this dissatisfaction and what can be done about it. While few suggest abandoning representative democracy altogether, there is increasingly a sensation that the traditional patterns of parliamentary decision-making need to be updated to accommodate the changing demands of citizens. Nevertheless, it remains unclear what democratic decision-making processes citizens want.\n\n# The Author(s) 2019.

Legitimacy may be deﬁned broadly as the capacity of a political system to engender and maintain the belief that existing institutions are the most appropriate or proper ones for the society’ (Lipset, 1959, p. 86). Legitimacy not only serves to grant authorities the right to make decisions, but also has instrumental value by reducing costs of enforcing compliance (Parkinson, 2006, p. 22). When citizens believe a system to be legitimate, people are for example more willing to accept decisions of authorities (Levi et al., 2009). We examine the effect of three characteristics of the decision-making process on perceived legitimacy. Empirical studies indicate the overall importance of outcome favourability when it comes to the perceived legitimacy of decision-making (Arnesen, 2017; Esaiasson et al., 2017). In systems where decision-making powers are delegated, it should also matter what political actors are involved in the decision-making process (Gro¨nlund and Seta¨la¨, 2012; Warren and Gastil, 2015). And even when political decisions do not meet the expectations, decision-makers can soften the blow by carefully justifying why a speciﬁc decision was taken (Pitkin, 1967; Chambers, 2003; Levendusky and Horowitz, 2012; Robison, 2017; Banducci et al., 2018). We here examine how outcome favourability, actors and justiﬁcation affect perceived decision-making legitimacy with the help of a population-based survey experiment linked to a citizen initiative on the issue of euthanasia delivered to the Finnish parliament. Perceived decision legitimacy is measured with the help of four measures: process approval, an index of perceived legitimacy, conﬁdence in political decision-making and support for the introduction of the measure. Our ﬁndings suggest that outcome favourability has a strong impact on perceived decision legitimacy. Moreover, we ﬁnd that citizens favour processes that involve experts, and to some extent ordinary citizens, over elected representatives making decisions independently. Interestingly, it also seems that giving a justiﬁcation for an outcome fails to enhance perceived legitimacy, and may even generate a backﬁre effect, whereby it increases the impact of outcome favourability on perceived legitimacy rather than cushions disappointment with an unfavourable outcome.\n\n1. Explaining perceived legitimacy of parliamentary decision-making\n\nIn this article, we examine various factors that can be expected to inﬂuence perceived legitimacy of parliamentary decision-making. Legitimacy is both a normative and an empirical concept. As a normative concept, it is often understood in terms of procedures and discourses used in making decisions and exercising power. According to this idea, a political system is legitimate when it conforms to\n\n2 Parliamentary Affairs\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\ncertain notions of how a system ought to function, for example following the models of liberal or deliberative democracy (Beetham, 1991; Habermas, 1996). When understood in empirical terms, legitimacy is expected to hinge on citizens’ beliefs and perceptions of political systems, processes or decisions rather than on independent criteria for legitimate procedures. In this article, we are interested in legitimacy in this empirical sense. Admittedly, the normative and empirical interpretations are likely to be connected since a system with normatively desirable features is also more likely to be considered legitimate in the eyes of citizens. The starting point is the idea that citizens want decision-makers to deliver outcomes that are in line with the stated preferences of citizens. According to Beetham (1991, p. 138), a political system can be justiﬁed by the ruled based on its ability to provide citizens with what they need or want from a society, e.g. security and welfare. When governments fail to do so, this will invariably affect judgments about legitimacy. In more narrow terms, outcome favourability may be understood as a correspondence between political decisions and the stated preference of an individual, which is likely to be a central factor inﬂuencing perceived legitimacy of parliamentary decision-making. Unsurprisingly, it is a recurring ﬁnding that those who are among the ‘winners’ tend to have more positive evaluations of the functioning of the democratic system, however conceived (Holmberg et al., 2017). Recent studies suggest that outcome favourability inﬂuences whether people ﬁnd decisions or procedures acceptable (Arnesen, 2017; Esaiasson et al., 2017). Using a panel survey to study reactions to a proposed restructuring of the local school system, Esaiasson et al. (2017) ﬁnd that the importance citizens ascribe to receiving a favourable outcome limits the signiﬁcance of a responsive process. Arnesen (2017) reports a similar ﬁnding from two population-based survey experiments, where he ﬁnds that preferred outcomes matter to respondents whereas inﬂuence over decision-making has little impact on outcome acceptability. A potential explanation for the impact of outcome favourability can be found in the research on cognitive biases such as motivated reasoning (Ford, 2012). According to this literature, humans are goal-directed information processors who tend to evaluate information with a directional bias toward reinforcing their pre-existing views (Molden and Higgins, 2005). The central component to motivated reasoning is hot cognition, i.e. whenever people are expected to react to some political stimuli for which they have prior impression, the brain automatically responds with the appropriate affective marker, be it positive or negative (Morrell, 2010, p. 132). In relation to decision legitimacy this would mean that if a policy outcome suits prior preferences, it generates a strong positive reaction, whereas a negative outcome leads to a negative reaction (Arvai and Froschauer, 2010). Based on this, our ﬁrst hypothesis is that:\n\nPerceived Legitimacy of Political Decision-Making 3\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\nH1: Perceived legitimacy is higher when a decision is in line with the preferred outcome.\n\nOther factors may also inﬂuence how people evaluate political decision-making. We here focus on how two aspects of the process leading up to a political decision affect the perceived legitimacy of decision-making: the actors involved and the provision of justiﬁcations. According to some authors (Saward, 2000; Geissel and Newton, 2012), people are more likely to consider decisions as legitimate when the decision-making process includes different actors. Accordingly, a legitimate political process must ensure that there are adequate possibilities for a variety of political actors to provide input into the decision-making to ensure legitimacy. For parliamentary decision-making, the role of scientiﬁc advice has been debated (Maasen and Weingart, 2005), while others stress the importance of input from ordinary citizens (Leston-Bandeira and Thompson, 2017; Hendriks and Kay, 2017). This discussion is also central in the literature that examines process preferences (Font et al., 2015; Bengtsson and Christensen, 2016), which ﬁnd a persistent pattern of process preferences across Europe whereby people distinguish between preferences for representative, participatory and expert1 decisionmaking. It is therefore important to examine how perceived legitimacy varies depending on the inclusion of different actors in parliamentary decision-making. People are not only making judgements regarding policy outcomes, but also about the actors involved in the decision-making process as well as their trustworthiness. While political trust and legitimacy are theoretically separate concepts, they are empirically closely linked (Johnson et al., 2014). Perceived legitimacy of decisionmaking can therefore be expected to be higher when people have trust in actors involved in the process.\n\nWarren and Gastil (2015) contend that different political actors, such as experts, elected representatives and fellow citizens, are trusted on different grounds. Trust in elected representatives is selective because citizens tend to have in Warren’s and Gastil’s (2015, p. 566) terms ‘[. . .] warranted distrust of representatives who hold opposing interests’. In addition to partisanship, representatives are driven by electoral motivations, which give citizens further reasons for distrust. Empirical studies show that citizens tend to have less trust in elected representatives than public ofﬁcials that are expected to be\n\n1Building on the work of Hibbing and Theiss-Morse (2002), the stealth model consists of two disparate decision-makers: business leaders and experts. However, in a European context is has been argued that it is more important to consider the role of experts (Font et al., 2015), which we do here.\n\n4 Parliamentary Affairs\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\nimpartial (e.g. courts) or provide public goods (e.g. the police) (Gro¨nlund and Seta¨la¨, 2012). According to Warren and Gastil (2015), trust in experts is based on their competence and professional practices and ethics maintaining norms such as impartiality. Because citizens are willing to defer their judgements to experts, trusting these entails rather low cognitive demands on citizens. Warren and Gastil (2015) also discuss trust in decision-making by fellow citizens. Citizen deliberative bodies such as deliberative mini-publics are likely to be trusted because they are descriptively representative and include non-partisan citizens, or ‘people like you’. In a similar vein, Arnesen and Peters (2017) ﬁnd that descriptive representation promotes decision acceptability. In addition, the deliberative processes in minipublics are designed to facilitate balanced and good-quality judgements, and empirical studies on the Citizens’ Initiative Review in Oregon show that minipublics were regarded as trustworthy as impartial bodies such as courts and more so than elected representative bodies (Warren and Gastil, 2015: 571). Since this suggests that citizens prefer other actors than elected representatives to be involved in decision-making, we examine the following two hypotheses:\n\nH2a: Perceived legitimacy is higher when experts are involved in decisionmaking compared to when elected representatives make decisions themselves. H2b: Perceived legitimacy is higher when citizens are involved in decisionmaking compared to when elected representatives make decisions themselves.\n\nThe actors involved is not the only relevant factor for how the process affects perceived legitimacy. There is a substantial literature on procedural justice argues that perceived legitimacy depends on people’s experience on fairness of decisionmaking procedures (Tyler and Caine, 1981; Tyler, 2001). This usually not only refers to the fairness of decision-making process used by public authorities, but may also concern other aspects such as fair consideration of all the relevant information on the issue and impartiality of public administration. Previous studies have examined how the provision of justiﬁcations affect the perception of political actors (Levendusky and Horowitz, 2012; Robison, 2017; Banducci et al., 2018). According to this line of research, justiﬁcations can help alleviate negative reactions from changing opinion or going back on campaign pledges. A speciﬁc interpretation of justiﬁcations is given in the literature on deliberative democracy where different policy alternatives are judged by the merits of the arguments supporting them. In theories of deliberative democracy, accountability is primarily understood in terms of ‘giving an account’, that is, publicly articulating, explaining and most importantly justifying public policy (Cohen, 1997, pp. 76–77; Chambers, 2003). Hanna Pitkin (1967) argues similarly that elected\n\nPerceived Legitimacy of Political Decision-Making 5\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\nrepresentatives are free to deﬁne the actions that are in the best interest of the represented if they present ‘good reasons in terms of their interest of why their views are not in accord with their interest’ (Pitkin, 1967, pp. 209–210). The publicity principle almost always involves a claim about the salutary effects of going public with the reasons and arguments backing up a policy, proposal or claim (Gutmann and Thompson, 1996, pp. 97–101). Even if the arguments fail to convince citizens that an outcome is superior, the provision of reasons can serve to convince them that decision-makers have made their decisions based on careful consideration of different viewpoints, which is important since few, if any, decisions will please everyone they affect. According to this line of reasoning, justiﬁcations should enhance decision-making legitimacy. Contrary to this, some empirical studies have found that people have difﬁculties unpacking the quality of decision-making from their outcomes, meaning that the deliberativeness of the process makes little difference in terms of perceived legitimacy (Arvai and Froschauer, 2010). Nevertheless, our H3 is:\n\nH3: Perceived legitimacy is higher when the decision is justiﬁed by provision of arguments\n\nHence, we examine the direct effects of outcome favourability, actor involvement and justiﬁcations. However, there may also be an intricate interplay between them. For one, justiﬁcation from experts may have a stronger positive effect whereas arguments from politicians are less likely to be taken at face value. Trust in actors may be important here. While it is established that people seek out for information conﬁrming their pre-dispositions, the reception of incongruent information or arguments could be facilitated by respondents’ trust in political actors who present it. We examine this proposition in H4:\n\nH4: The effect of justiﬁcations on perceived legitimacy is stronger when experts deliver the arguments compared to when other actors do so.\n\nAnother possible interaction concerns the interplay between outcomes and justiﬁcations, which entails that it is insufﬁcient to consider only whether decisionmakers provide justiﬁcations. Instead, it is imperative to consider whether these are in line with or contradict individual preferences to grasp the impact of justiﬁcation. For example, some argue that justiﬁcations for a measure may help soften the blow among those who from the outset were not in favour of that decision (Pitkin, 1967; Chambers, 2003; Towﬁgh et al., 2016). Contrary to this, a growing body of research imply that providing justiﬁcations may have adverse effects on legitimacy. Not only do people disparage information that undercuts their beliefs or worldview (Molden and Higgins, 2005), information or justiﬁcations for an adverse outcome may produce a backﬁre effect, which entails that justiﬁcations decrease rather than increase perceived legitimacy (Nyhan and Reiﬂer, 2010;\n\n6 Parliamentary Affairs\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\nGuess and Coppock, 2018). Accordingly, people who receive a verbal justiﬁcation for an unfavourable outcome would not react to it as a validation of the decision, but rather as further politicisation of the outcome. Being exposed to an argument that contradicts an initial opinion can therefore have a delegitimising effect. These conﬂicting expectations for the interplay between outcome and justiﬁcations are the topic for our ﬁnal hypothesis:\n\nH5: The effect of outcome favourability on perceived legitimacy is moderated by justiﬁcations.\n\nIn the following, we explain how we examine these hypotheses.\n\n2. Data, variables and methods\n\nIn this section, we ﬁrst describe the background for the experiment, before moving on to explaining the structure of our survey experiment and the main variables used in the empirical examination.\n\n2.1 The survey experiment\n\nA population-based survey experiment is an experiment that is administered to a representative population sample (Mutz, 2011, p. 2). While the intention is to produce experimental subjects that are representative of the population, other studies demonstrate that treatment effects from convenience samples are similar to those obtained from representative samples (Mullinix et al., 2015). Survey experiments make it possible to administer randomized treatments to larger and more diverse samples, thereby alleviating some of the concerns with external validity of the experimental approach (Mutz, 2011, pp. 8–20). For our purposes, the main advantage is that it is possible to discern what aspects of parliamentary decision-making respondents ﬁnd particularly important when evaluating legitimacy. Our data come from a survey experiment conducted during December 2017 in Finland. The background for the study is a real citizens’ initiative that proposed to legalize euthanasia in Finland. We chose to focus on this discussion for three reasons. The ﬁrst two are methodological. First, it was highly topical at the time, meaning the experiment is tied to an on-going public discussion. Survey experiments often rely on hypothetical scenarios, which is a potential problem for the validity of the answers when respondents fail to connect the scenario to realistic decisions. Secondly, euthanasia may be regarded an example of an ‘easy issue’ (Carmines and Stimson, 1980), which means that it is more likely possible to elicit a ‘gut response’ from respondents even when they do not have a profound understanding of the issue. This makes it more likely that we can examine the mechanisms at play in shaping decision-making legitimacy. The third reason is substantive. By relying on a\n\nPerceived Legitimacy of Political Decision-Making 7\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\nprocess involving a citizens’ initiative, we tie the experiment to the on-going discussion on how to involve the public in the legislative process (Leston-Bandeira, 2012; Leston-Bandeira and Thompson, 2017). The citizens’ initiative forms part of efforts to improve relationships between parliament and citizens (Su Seo and Raunio 2017). We add to this discussion by examining what procedures citizens want parliament to adapt when scrutinising input from citizens. Since 1 March 2012, 50,000 Finnish citizens eligible to vote have had the right to make legislative proposals to the Finnish parliament (Eduskunta). The Finnish citizens’ initiative (CI) is a so-called ‘indirect’ or ‘agenda’ initiative because it does not lead to a popular vote. It is in the parliamentary discretion to decide whether to approve, amend or reject any initiative. After submission to parliament, each initiative goes to a relevant committee, which discusses and gives a report on the initiative before it is voted on in plenary (Christensen et al., 2017). The initiative ‘On behalf of a good death’, which aimed to legalize euthanasia, gathered more than 63,000 signatures and was delivered to Finnish parliament in February 2017 (Yle News, 2017, 2 February). The process gathered interest in national media, not least because a coalition of senior parliamentarians from several political parties were behind launching the citizens’ initiative (Yle News, 2016, 19 December). Hearings on the initiative by the Social Affairs and Health committee commenced in November 2017. In the end, Parliament on 4 May 2018 decided to reject the initiative with a plenary vote where a comfortable majority of 12,860 backed the decision. Our experiment was conducted in a survey distributed via Qualtrics and responses collected 7–15 December 2017 during the hearings in the committee. The survey comprised an online sample including 1243 respondents2 stratiﬁed to reﬂect the general population structure when it comes to gender and age and reﬂects the general population when it comes to the proportion with higher educational qualiﬁcations (See Supplementary Material). Nevertheless, the respondents come from an online panel assembled by data providers through nonprobability methods, meaning we cannot exclude that there is an element of self-selection. However, since estimates from convenience samples as mentioned are similar to purely random samples, this should not be a major cause for concern (Mullinix et al., 2015).\n\n2The sample originally comprised 1251 respondents but to ensure data quality, we deleted ﬁve respondents who took more than an hour to complete the survey and three respondents who completed it in less than 60 seconds. This did not affect the composition of the sample.\n\n8 Parliamentary Affairs\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\n2.2 Vignette\n\nIn the vignette for our survey experiment, we describe a decision-making process on euthanasia where we randomly vary components to examine the importance of:\n\n(1) ACTORS: Whether the decision-making involves politicians, experts or ordinary citizens.\n\n(2) OUTCOME FAVOURABILITY: Whether recommendation for a ﬁnal decision is favourable or unfavourable compared to peoples’ preferences.\n\n(3) JUSTIFICATION: Whether or not the decision was justiﬁed by presenting arguments in support of the decision.\n\nWe phrased the vignette as follows (Randomized elements in capital; TREATMENT NAME BOLDED: ITALICS: PHRASING 1/PHRASING 2):\n\nThere is currently a debate in Finland on whether euthanasia (actively ending life) should be allowed, and Parliament decides on a citizens’ initiative proposing this during this parliamentary term. Before deciding, the matter is debated thoroughly. Imagine that the preparations are made in the following manner: A group of [ACTORS: EXPERTS/ORDINARY CITIZENS/ PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATIVES] discusses the issue of euthanasia. Many different points of views are presented during the discussions. The [ACTORS: EXPERTS/ORDINARY CITIZENS/ PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATIVES] produce a recommendation based on deliberation. The recommendation is that euthanasia should [OUTCOME FAVOURABILITY: BE ALLOWED/NOT BE ALLOWED].

PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM AN INCURABLE ILLNESS AND INTOLERABLE PAIN SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO ENDURE AGAINST THEIR WILL/[ARGUMENT AGAINST WHEN RECOMMENDATION NEGATIVE] EUTHANASIA IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND WEAKENS THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE IN SOCIETY. QUESTIONING THE VALUE OF LIFE MAY LEAD TO CASES WHERE EUTHANASIA IS CARRIED OUT AGAINST THE WILL OF THE PATIENT.]\n\nPerceived Legitimacy of Political Decision-Making 9\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\n2.3 Treatment variables\n\nFor actors, a categorical variable distinguish three groups that correspond to whether elected politicians made the decisions singlehandedly, or involved expert or a group of citizens. Previous studies ﬁnd that the distinction between politicians, experts and citizens is well entrenched in the Finnish population (Bengtsson and Christensen, 2016) and we therefore expect that respondents should have clear perceptions of these actors. We do not examine any combinations of actors, which would best reﬂect the empirical reality of policy-making in Finland, but instead focus on the distinctive impact of each set of actors. For outcome favourability, we combine prior preferences with the outcome recommended in the vignette. To measure prior preferences, we before the vignette ask respondents to indicate their attitudes towards the introduction of euthanasia on a ﬁve-point Likert scale (Strongly in favour-strongly opposed).3 The answers were recoded into three categories: For euthanasia (70.7%)/Neutral (19.5%)/Against Euthanasia (9.8%). We subsequently combined this with whether the recommendation presented in the vignette was to introduce euthanasia or not (49% exposed to recommendation to not introduce and 51% to a positive recommendation). The ﬁnal measure of outcome favourability divides respondents into Unfavourable outcome when the recommendation for or against euthanasia contradicted the preference of the respondent (39.8%), Neutral when no preference was indicated (19.5%) and Favourable outcome when the recommendation and the stated preference for euthanasia were aligned (40.7%).4\n\nFor justiﬁcations, we include a variable that measure whether the recommendation for or against was accompanied by arguments justifying the recommendation. Euthanasia is a controversial issue with a long-standing debate where several different arguments from ethical, medical and economical standpoints have been presented both for and against (Rietjens et al., 2009). Our aim here was not to construct sophisticated arguments able to convince respondents about the merits of the proposal. Instead, we merely seek to examine how offering an argument to justify a decision affects the perception of legitimacy. To this end, we relied on two classical arguments for and against that should be familiar to the respondents when phrasing our arguments. The argument in favour emphasises the free will of the individual (right to die), whereas the argument against emphasises the possible negative effects on moral in society\n\n3We asked this question before the vignette to ensure that the results were unaffected by the experimental design. To avoid unintentionally priming the respondents to be either for or against euthanasia we asked for their attitudes towards several issues that have been the topic of citizens’ initiatives.\n\n4We also tested a simpler dichotomous version where we combined the neutral category with the opposing category and the substantial results were similar.\n\n10 Parliamentary Affairs\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\n(slippery slope) (Devettere, 2016). These are obviously simplistic arguments that fail to capture the richness of the possible scientiﬁc or ethical arguments for or against euthanasia. Nevertheless, they are typical of the type of arguments used in the public debate on euthanasia and should therefore be recognisable as such to the respondents. Hence, even if they may not be the most convincing arguments, the respondents should recognise them as actual arguments for or against the issue, which is what we aim for here.\n\n2.4 Outcome measures\n\nWe use four different variables to capture the perceived legitimacy of the decision-making; i.e. how respondents evaluate the legitimacy of the decisionmaking process. The ﬁrst two are directly related to the perceived legitimacy of the process whereas the two others indicate whether the decision-making had broader consequences for conﬁdence in political decision-making and policy support:\n\n(1) Process satisfaction: A single measure indicating whether respondents felt that this way of making political decisions was satisfactory (To what extent do you ﬁnd this way of making political decisions on the issue acceptable? 7-point Likert scale Extremely acceptable–Extremely unacceptable).\n\n(2) Legitimacy index: Sum index based on six items measuring attitudes to aspects of input, throughput and output process legitimacy (Based on the decision-making process described before, please indicate the extent to which you agree with each of the following statements. This way of making political decisions. . .: (i). does not include all relevant interests [Reversed], (ii). Is made in an inclusive manner, (iii) is biased to favour certain interests [Reversed], (iv) is made in an appropriate manner, (v) ensures a fair outcome and (vi) fails to ensure an outcome that beneﬁts society [Reversed]. Five-point Likert scale Strongly agree–Strongly disagree; Cronbach’s alpha ¼ 0.79).5\n\n(3) Conﬁdence in political decision-making: A single measure indicating whether respondents felt that their conﬁdence in political decision-making\n\n5We initially wanted to capture the distinction between input, throughput and output legitimacy presented by Schmidt (2013), but this distinction is not empirically viable in this case. A principal component analysis suggests that a two-dimensional solution is most appropriate where all reversed items load onto a separate dimension while a principal factors analysis suggests that a one-dimensional solution is more appropriate. Since the two-factor solution is most likely an artefact of the reversed coding (Weijters and Baumgartner, 2012), we proceed with a one-dimensional measure of process legitimacy. Preliminary analyses show similar substantial results for separate indexes measuring input, throughput and output legitimacy, which further indicates that process legitimacy is adequately captured by a single index in this case.\n\nPerceived Legitimacy of Political Decision-Making 11\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\nincreased as a result of the process (Based on the decision-making process described before, please indicate the extent to which you agree with each of the following statements. This way of making political decisions increased my conﬁdence in political decision-making. Five-point Likert scale Strongly agree– Strongly disagree).\n\n(4) Support for introduction of Euthanasia: A measure of how strongly respondents support approving the citizens’ initiative to allow euthanasia following the vignette, thereby measuring whether the decision-making affected policy support (To what extent do you support the approval of the citizens’ initiative to introduce euthanasia? Seven-point Likert scale Support a great deal–Oppose a great deal).\n\nAll outcome variables are coded to vary between 0 and 1 to make results comparable. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for all variables.\n\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics\n\nVariable n Mean SD Min Max Description\n\nActor 1243 1.00 0.82 0.00 2.00 Categorical variable with 3 categories (0¼Politicians, 1¼Citizens, 2¼Experts)\n\nOutcome favourability 1243 1.01 0.90 0.00 2.00 Categorical variable with 3 categories (0¼Unfavourable, 1¼Neutral 1¼Favourable)\n\nJustiﬁcation 1243 0.49 0.50 0.00 1.00 Categorical variable with 2 categories (0¼No justiﬁcation, 1¼Justiﬁcation provided)\n\nProcess approval 1243 0.65 0.23 0.00 1.00 7-point Likert scale recoded 0–1 (1¼High process approval)\n\nLegitimacy index 1243 0.50 0.17 0.00 1.00 Index 0–24 recoded 0–1 (1¼High legitimacy)\n\nConﬁdence in decision-making 1243 0.54 0.24 0.00 1.00 5-point Likert scale recoded 0–1 (1¼High positive inﬂuence on conﬁdence)\n\nSupport introduction 1243 0.72 0.25 0.00 1.00 7-point Likert scale recoded 0–1 (1¼High support for introduction)\n\n12 Parliamentary Affairs\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\nThe main method of analysis is three way ANOVA where we examine the impact of our three factors including their interactions for each outcome measure. The analyses do not include control variables since randomisation of respondents should ensure that all characteristics are evenly distributed between treatments and therefore cannot affect differences in outcomes (Mutz, 2011).6\n\n3. Analysis\n\nFirst, we display mean scores and standard deviations for all cells in Table 2. There are clear differences in mean scores between the cells. In particular, it seems like respondents presented with a favourable outcome perceive decisionmaking as more legitimate. The subsequent question concerns which of the differences are signiﬁcant? We examine this with three-way ANOVA for the four outcome measures in Table 3. The results conﬁrm the ﬁrst impression for H1 since the most persistent effect is found for outcome favourability. There are signiﬁcant differences in mean scores for process approval [F(2, 1225) ¼ 68.64, p < 0.000], legitimacy index [F(2, 1225) ¼ 58.75, p < 0.000], conﬁdence in decision-making [F(2, 1225) ¼ 23.73, p < 0.000] and support for introduction [F(2, 1225) ¼ 84.65, p < 0.000]. This shows that the respondents give signiﬁcantly higher approval of the process when the recommendation is in line with their preferred outcome, which corroborates H1. To illustrate what the signiﬁcant differences entail for perceived legitimacy, Figure 1 shows displays differences in predicated values of the outcome measures. The expected mean scores are about 0.1 higher on the 0–1 scale when there is a favourable recommendation compared to an unfavourable one. The only exception is support for the introduction, where it is only the neutral category that clearly deviates from the two others. This is evidence of the pervasive support for the introduction of euthanasia in Finland. Nevertheless, the results clearly show that perceived legitimacy depends on the outcome of the process, as H1 suggests. The second noticeable main effect concerns H2 and involvement of actors. Here there are signiﬁcant effects for the legitimacy index [F(2, 1225) ¼ 7.35, p < 0.001] and conﬁdence in decision-making [F(2, 1225) ¼ 4.52, p < 0.05]. Figure 2 shows how the mean scores are affected by what actor is involved.\n\n6Since one of our treatments includes an observed variable we checked that the respondents are evenly divided between the cells for the individual characteristics age, gender, education, religiosity and prior use of the citizens’ initiative. The results of the ANOVA analyses suggested no signiﬁcant differences and we therefore refrain from presenting results including these characteristics as control variables.

The contrasts show that the differences between politicians and experts are statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) for both measures, whereas the differences between citizens and politicians are only signiﬁcant for the legitimacy index. This shows that people prefer experts, and to at least some extent also citizens, to be involved in the decisionmaking when it comes to euthanasia. These results corroborate H2a and H2b. The main effects of justiﬁcation are less pronounced since there are no signiﬁcant main effects, which means H3 is not supported. However, this does not entail that this aspect is inconsequential.

The implications of this are shown in Figure 3. The results are again uniform for both measures and show that while justiﬁcations do not have a signiﬁcant main effect on perceived legitimacy, delivering arguments in favour of the recommendation serves to boost the differences in perceived legitimacy depending on outcome favourability. When no justiﬁcation is given for the recommendation, the differences in mean scores between favourable and unfavourable outcomes are less pronounced, and the mean score is even slightly higher for an unfavourable outcome when it comes to supporting the introduction of euthanasia (albeit non-signiﬁcant). However, when justiﬁcation is given in the form of arguments, it serves to increase the differences between favourable and unfavourable outcomes by increasing legitimacy among those who get their preferred outcome and decreasing it among those who do not.\n\n4. Discussion of results\n\nOur results have several implications for the prospects of reforming representative democracy and parliamentary decision-making in particular.

This ﬁnding is in line with several previous studies (Arnesen, 2017, Arnesen and Peters, 2017; Esaiasson et al., 2017). It may appear unsurprising that people prefer decision-making that delivers policy outputs in line with their preferences, but the pervasiveness of the effect is nonetheless remarkable. The effect here is not limited to outcome acceptability, as Arnesen and Peters (2017) ﬁnd, but also people’s perception of the quality of decision-making. That people tend to think that the decision-making is of high quality when the outcome matches their initial preferences conﬁrms the ﬁndings by Arvai and Froschauer (2010) and suggests that people have difﬁculties separating outcomes from other characteristics of decision-making. From a democratic perspective, the strong impact of outcome satisfaction on legitimacy beliefs is somewhat discomforting, since political decisions hardly ever please everyone. This ﬁnding conﬁrms the conventional wisdom that political decision-makers need to be responsive to citizens’ demands to preserve legitimacy. However, our other ﬁndings show that perceived legitimacy is not only affected by outcomes. Based on previous research we hypothesized (H2aþH2b) that perceived legitimacy is higher when experts or citizens, rather than elected representatives, are involved in preparing decisions. The results suggest that, regardless of both outcomes and arguments, people favour decision-making processes that involve ordinary citizens and experts over elected representatives deciding on their own. While we do not directly test the effect of trust on the perceived legitimacy of decision-making, this ﬁnding may be interpreted to support the claim that people distrust representatives, which goes beyond what Warren and Gastil (2015: 566) call ‘warranted distrust’ in representatives of opposing interests. It is noteworthy that experts seem to be particularly favoured in this case. People tend to value issue knowledge over accountability for the issue of euthanasia, which is not only medical, but also a moral in its nature. While we do not believe that our results indicate a general preference for expert decision-making, they show that people are sometimes willing to let people who they believe have the proper competences decide on complicated matters such as euthanasia. It is worth recalling the argument by Warren and Gastil (2015) that trust in experts and professionals may lead people to defer their own judgements. Moreover, it should be noted that we did not specify what kind of experts were involved in the decision-making. When it comes to euthanasia, this could include philosophers, medical experts and people with terminal diseases. Nevertheless, the results suggest that involvement of expertise as well as ordinary citizens increase legitimacy of decision-making in the eyes of citizens. The direct effect of justiﬁcations (H3) was negligible, meaning respondents seemed to care little about whether decision-makers present arguments to justify\n\n18 Parliamentary Affairs\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\ntheir decisions. This result seems to contradict the position of deliberative democrats who emphasise the importance of reason giving and argumentation for the legitimacy of decisions. In this way, our results indicate a mismatch between normative conceptions and empirical measurements of legitimacy, previously pointed out by Johnson et al. (2014), for example. The reason for the lack of direct impact of justiﬁcation may be that the arguments presented failed to match those put forward in public debate on euthanasia, in the media and so on. Even so, the results imply that not any justiﬁcation will do, and the quality of the arguments matters as well. However, justiﬁcations had an indirect effect since we found that they can serve to increase the gap in perceived legitimacy between those who get their preferred outcome and those who fail to do so (H5). It seems that rather than cushion the blow (Towﬁgh et al., 2016), justiﬁcations here serve to intensify the differences. These ﬁndings are in line with research suggesting that arguments and information contradicting prior opinions can produce a backﬁre effect since contradicting arguments activate a negative response in people who do not agree with the outcome (Nyhan and Reiﬂer, 2010). Here it is again important to note that the justiﬁcations we used were not intended to be particularly sophisticated, as explained in the research design. Research focusing on backlash effects suggest that how information is delivered is important for peoples’ reaction to it. For example, Nyhan and Reiﬂer (2018) ﬁnd that graphical evidence is more powerful than textual evidence for correcting misperceptions. Similarly, Guess and Coppock (2018) show that an academic sterile description of facta is less likely to generate a backlash. It is possible that our arguments triggered a backﬁre effect since they restated common pro and con arguments in the debate on euthanasia rather than provide responses to speciﬁc concerns. Nevertheless, while our results by no means constitute irrevocable evidence for the existence of a backlash effect, they at least indicate that providing general arguments that do not address citizens’ concerns may be counterproductive for decision-making legitimacy. To this end, decision-makers should aim to speciﬁcally address the concerns of citizens rather than provide general statements. While these results produce several insights concerning factors that affect decision-making legitimacy, they come with some limitations. It is unclear whether similar results would be obtained for other types of decisions. Future studies ought to examine whether similar results are obtained in other policy areas since it is likely that both the intensity of outcome favourability and preferences for actor involvement differ systematically across policy areas. It should also be recognised that the experimental approach entails certain limitations when it comes to external validity. Our results may be partly due to fact that our experimental design did not vary the process of exchanging different\n\nPerceived Legitimacy of Political Decision-Making 19\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\narguments in the preparation of a decision, nor did it examine the impact of combinations of actors or different types of arguments. It is noteworthy that several studies that ﬁnd that outcomes shape legitimacy are survey experiments (Arvai and Froschauer, 2010; Arnesen, 2017; Arnesen and Peters, 2017). Although Hainmueller et al. (2015) ﬁnd that hypothetical choices in survey experiments successfully capture actual behaviour when it comes to voting behaviour in referendums, it should be acknowledged that this method creates an artiﬁcial scenario that does not necessarily capture actual preferences. In our experiment, respondents were presented with a single hypothetical situation for a decision-making procedure, which may fail to do justice to many of the procedural and discursive aspects of legitimacy stated in normative theories of democracy. In real life, political decision-making occurs in a context multiple and repeated processes and here the importance of receiving a favourable outcome in single case might diminish, while the appreciation of proper justiﬁcations and accountability of representatives might turn out to be crucial. More research is therefore needed to settle these issues conclusively.\n\nSupplementary Data\n\nSupplementary Data are available at Parliamentary Affairs Online.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nA previous version of this article was presented at the 2018 ECPR Joint Sessions in Nicosia, Cyprus, workshop ‘Can Participatory Reforms save Representative Democracy?’ The authors would like to thank all participants for helpful comments.\n\nFunding\n\nThis research was funded by Academy of Finland [grant number 274305 (Democratic Reasoning) and 285167 (Democratic innovations in Finland and political legitimacy)].\n\nConﬂict of Interest\n\nThe authors have no conﬂicts of interest to report.\n\n20 Parliamentary Affairs\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pa/gsz014/5443270 by Lancaster University user on 12 April 2019\n\nReferences\n\nArnesen, S.

Nas décadas de 70 e 80, a evolução da Europa do Sul e de alguns países da América Latina levou a uma preocupação com a mudança de regime, ou seja, com as «transições para a democracia». Com a terceira vaga de democratizações, o foco de atenção mudou para a «consolidação democrática»: «dos modos como os regimes democráticos vêm a ser para os modos como se tornam estáveis e seguros» (Plattner 2005, 77). Hoje parece prevalecer uma dupla preocupação. Por um lado, a consolidação do autoritarismo, após processos de democratização, e a emergência de semidemocracias, ou regimes híbridos, provocaram um novo interesse sobre estudos das ditaduras e do autoritarismo competitivo (Levitsky e Way 2010). Por outro lado, com o fim da guerra fria e a expansão da democracia liberal no mundo,1 os académicos começaram a reflectir sobre uma nova realidade: o foco de interesse deixou de ser os processos de «transição» para a democracia, ou da sua «consolidação», para ser a «qualidade» da mesma. Como disse Adam Przeworski, «tendo estudado a liberalização, a transição e a consolidação, descobrimos que há algo ainda por melhorar: a democracia» (Przeworski 2010, XIII). Têm ocorrido desenvolvimentos metodológicos e teóricos consideráveis nesta nova forma de entender a democracia. Vários tipos de medições e avaliações têm sido desenvolvidos e aplicados às democracias com diferentes graus de consolidação (O’Donnell et al. 2004). No entanto, a maioria dessas medições e avaliações é movida por um objectivo comum: perceber o que faz uma democracia «melhor» ou «pior» e fornecer aos decisores políticos e outros agentes relevantes ideias sobre como esta pode ser melhorada e reforçada (Diamond e Morlino 2005; Morlino 2006).\n\nQualquer forma de «medir» a qualidade da democracia (QD) tem de começar com uma definição dos dois termos que constituem este conceito complexo e multidimensional: a democracia e a qualidade. Democracia não é de forma alguma um conceito consensual, mas talvez a definição mais pertinente utilizada seja a de Robert Dahl, que na sua obra Democracy and its Critics estabelece sete princípios que definem o seu tipo ideal de democracia, designada «poliarquia» (1989, 221):\n\n1. A existência dos eleitos constitucionalmente vinculados que controlam as decisões do governo sobre as políticas públicas; 2. A prática regular de eleições livres e justas, como um mecanismo para comparar e escolher as principais figuras do governo, conduzidas de um modo em que o uso da coerção é relativamente incomum; 3. Este sufrágio deve ser universal e inclusivo: praticamente todos os adultos têm o direito de votar (capacidade eleitoral activa); e 4. Candidatar-se para cargos electivos (capacidade eleitoral passiva), embora para alguns cargos electivos, como os presidenciais, possa haver maiores limites de idade para a elegibilidade do que para a capacidade de votar; 5. A existência de liberdades e garantias, que permitem aos cidadãos expressar-se sem medo de represálias ou punições severas sobre as suas ideias e o posicionamento político, incluindo as suas críticas em relação aos funcionários públicos, ao governo, ao regime, à ordem sócio-económica e à ideologia dominante; 6. Os cidadãos também têm o direito de buscar fontes alternativas de informação, que devem ser reguladas e protegidas por lei; 7. Assim como têm o direito de formar associações relativamente autónomas, incluindo partidos políticos e grupos de interesses independentes, para atingir os seus direitos, incluindo os listados acima.\n\nEsta definição foi enriquecida por outras contribuições (Schmitter e Karl 1991; Morlino 2006; O’Donnell 2010; Przeworski 2010), mas a sua essência permanece inalterada: a poliarquia de Dahl oferece uma conceptualização processual ou procedimental da democracia. Contudo, a democracia, como um sistema de governação, não se caracteriza apenas por um conjunto de regras e procedimentos básicos a estabelecer quem tem o direito de tomar decisões colectivas. A democracia é também um conjunto de valores fundamentais historicamente construído e uma mistura complexa de instituições que colocam esses\n\nAntónio Costa Pinto, Luís de Sousa e Pedro Magalhães\n\n18\n\nIntrodução\n\n19\n\nprincípios em prática com sucesso maior ou menor (Bobbio 1988; Mény 1999; Beetham 1994). Neste sentido, poderíamos argumentar que a poliarquia de Dahl não é o ponto de chegada, mas o de partida. Como formulou Michael Coppedge, a poliarquia é «um grau mínimo aceitável de democracia» (2004, 240). Mas como é que se passa da discussão sobre se um regime é ou não «democrático» para a discussão sobre a «qualidade da democracia»? Larry Diamond e Leonardo Morlino (2005, XI) sugerem que a «qualidade» tem três significados, com diferentes implicações para a sua medição: (1) qualidade do procedimento (procedure quality) no qual a qualidade de um produto «é o resultado de um proceso exacto e controlado, que obedece a métodos e timings precisos e rigorosos»; (2) qualidade do conteúdo (content quality), ou seja, a qualidade que resulta «das características estruturais de um produto, tais como a sua configuração, os materiais ou o seu modo de funcionamento»; (3) qualidade dos resultados (result quality), ou seja, a qualidade de um produto ou serviço «pode ser directamente observável através do grau de satisfação do cliente, independentemente da forma como o produto em causa é produzido e do seu conteúdo específico». Na base destas definições, os autores conceptualizam a «qualidade da democracia» como um regime em que aos cidadãos é concedido «um alto grau de liberdade, igualdade política e controlo sobre as políticas públicas e os políticos através do funcionamento legítimo e legal de instituições estáveis . Nesta linha, uma «boa» democracia é, em primeiro lugar, um regime amplamente legitimado que satisfaz as expectativas dos cidadãos em relação à governação (qualidade em termos de resultado). Uma «boa democracia» é também [um regime] em que os seus cidadãos, associações e comunidades desfrutam de uma liberdade e igualdade política vasta (qualidade em termos de conteúdo). Finalmente, uma «boa» democracia também é um regime em que os cidadãos têm o poder soberano para avaliar se o governo fornece a liberdade e a igualdade de acordo com o Estado de direito. Os cidadãos, as suas organizações e os partidos participam e competem para garantir que os eleitos sejam responsáveis pelas suas políticas e acções. Eles monitorizam a eficácia e a equidade da aplicação das leis, a eficácia das decisões do governo e a responsabilidade política e a responsividade das autoridades eleitas. As instituições governamentais também são mutuamente responsáveis (hold one another accountable) perante a lei e a constituição (qualidade em termos de procedimento)» (Diamond e Morlino 2005, XI). No entanto, esta definição de QOD levanta três problemas. Primeiro, há a presunção geral de que as várias dimensões que definem a qualidade\n\nAntónio Costa Pinto, Luís de Sousa e Pedro Magalhães\n\n20\n\nda democracia – normativa, processual ou dos resultados – devem relacionar-se de uma forma harmoniosa. Mas a crença de que essas diferentes dimensões possam convergir e evoluir para um tipo de política ideal continua a ser uma utopia. A evidência histórica ensina que nenhuma democracia pode ser equiparada ao tal tipo-ideal. A análise comparativa demonstra que há espaço para inconsistências e compensações entre as várias dimensões da QD. Como explicam Diamond e Morlino (Diamond e Morlino 2005, XXXII-III), «Com certeza, todas as coisas boas não funcionam sem problemas. Uma democracia de alta qualidade, portanto, não será indefinidamente alta em todas as [dimensões] da qualidade da democracia. Democracia é um conceito e uma realidade política suficientemente elástica para lidar e conviver com essas contradições [que são] produtos dos processos de modernização inacabados». Mény (1999, 115) coloca a mesma ideia de uma forma sucinta: «Aquilo a que tradicionalmente e facilmente chamamos ‘a democracia’ é um sistema que mistura intimamente elementos democráticos com não democráticos em combinações que variam no tempo e no espaço, sujeitos continuamente a uma análise da sua legitimidade perante as elites, em particular, e as pessoas, em geral». Segundo, há uma crença generalizada de que as pessoas têm uma compreensão comum dessas dimensões no seio de uma sociedade e entre sociedades diferentes. No entanto, ao avaliar a qualidade da democracia, deve-se ter em mente que as estruturas cognitivas sobre as instituições e os processos da democracia são substancialmente diferentes em grupos sociais distintos, em especial entre os que exercem o poder e aqueles sobre quem a autoridade é exercida. Os cidadãos organizam o seu conhecimento sobre a democracia por meio de quadros mentais abstractos, alimentados por uma variedade de fontes de informação (como os media, vários grupos sociais, livros, internet...), com diferentes graus de sofisticação e consistência. Esses quadros mentais representam a sua compreensão sobre como a democracia está organizada e como funciona. Por outras palavras, as pessoas recorrem a esquemas para organizar o conhecimento actual e fornecer um quadro para a compreensão da democracia. Por outro lado, as percepções dos políticos são mais endógenas ao sistema político e por isso tendem a expressar uma visão mais elaborada e informada do seu modus operandi. Este contraste em níveis cognitivos é fundamental para a compreensão do apoio e da legitimidade da democracia. É importante distinguir entre as percepções sobre o desempenho do regime democrático realizado por um actor com responsabilidades directas pelo seu funcionamento daquelas mantidas pelos cidadãos em\n\nIntrodução\n\n21\n\ngeral, que são em grande parte mantidos à distância da política e só são convidados a interagir com a mesma durante as eleições (e só excepcionalmente por referendo ou por outras formas de participação institucionalizada). Da mesma forma, as variações entre sociedades e culturas sobre os significados e entendimentos da democracia também podem ser consideráveis. Curiosamente, parece que, quando é pedido às pessoas para definirem a democracia, a maioria dos cidadãos em países muito diferentes parece centrar-se nas liberdades cívicas, e não tanto em eleições ou regras constitucionais: «as pessoas parecem entender que a democracia eleitoral e constitucional não é suficiente. Para a maioria das pessoas, o verdadeiro significado da democracia é o que ela produz» (Dalton et al. 2007, 147). Contudo, em alguns países, as definições da democracia baseadas na igualdade e justiça social competem em importância com outras (Dalton et al 2007, 147; v. também Camp 2001). Traços culturais e padrões de desenvolvimento institucional e/ou sócio-económico diferentes ajudam a explicar as variações em percepções dos cidadãos, a aquiescência e a apropriação de padrões democráticos. As pessoas que experimentaram a democracia deliberativa já podem atribuir à participação um valor diferente daquelas que só são chamadas a dar o seu voto a cada quatro anos. As pessoas que viveram até recentemente sob o autoritarismo são susceptíveis de dar um valor mais alto à transparência das instituições de governação, enquanto aquelas que vivem sob condições económicas adversas podem acreditar que a transparência e a responsabilidade são secundárias à eficiência. E assim por diante. A noção de que diferentes indivíduos e grupos têm crenças diferentes sobre o significado de democracia levanta a terceira e última questão, aquela que é central neste livro: as definições académicas sobre a «qualidade da democracia» nem sempre reflectem as expectativas das pessoas. E, a este respeito, é bastante difícil de atingir um equilíbrio. Por um lado, isto levanta um problema para as medições da «qualidade da democracia» que não incluam os indicadores da opinião pública, ou seja, a maneira como os cidadãos, em geral, avaliam essa mesma qualidade, assim como a maneira como pessoas diferentes fazem avaliações distintas. Não é surpreendente que uma democracia possa ter uma pontuação elevada nas várias dimensões da «qualidade da democracia» medida «objectivamente», mas que os seus cidadãos possam sentir-se insatisfeitos com o desempenho do seu regime. Mesmo que tentemos explicar tal discrepância como resultado de uma capacidade cognitiva pública bastante baixa para compreender as políticas/política, da vulnerabilidade dos cidadãos\n\nAntónio Costa Pinto, Luís de Sousa e Pedro Magalhães\n\n22\n\nao sensacionalismo dos media, da diversidade de interesses e preocupações na sociedade e da tendência inerente dos cidadãos para estarem sempre insatisfeitos com aquilo que têm, isso não os impede de avaliar a qualidade da sua própria democracia quando confrontam o seu modus operandi com os mecanismos e resultados de outros regimes. Em última análise, como alerta Plattner (2005, 78 e 81), a selecção de padrões/indicadores para fins de medição ou auditoria da qualidade da democracia é frequentemente tendenciosa, porque impõe as preferências políticas particulares de investigadores «como padrões objectivos da qualidade» aos cidadãos nativos dos países que estão a ser estudados. É certo que devemos ter o cuidado de não generalizar ou relativizar demasiado os conceitos, deixando a cidadãos que, em alguns casos, podem até não ter experimentado o funcionamento de um regime processual democrático a tarefa de definir o que os investigadores querem medir. Em vez disso, como sugere Michael Coppedge, temos de ser responsáveis pela conversão de interesses e visões da democracia em conceitos analíticos e sócio-científicos, decidindo «quais destes conceitos podem ser naturalmente articulados num quadro teórico coerente» (2004, 241). Contudo, mesmo que os cidadãos possam eventualmente apresentar noções parciais, distorcidas e menos sofisticadas da democracia, a verdade é que cada indivíduo tem uma visão de um regime ou uma sociedade em que ele gostaria de viver. Por isso, mais do que ser um conceito contestado, a democracia é um processo em constante redefinição. Daí que seja crucial estabelecer formas válidas para medir e avaliar o progresso democrático tanto para os políticos como para os cidadãos, em geral, poderem avaliar a evolução da sua democracia (Diamond e Morlino 2005). É este o mote geral que preside a este livro: analisar, de forma rigorosa e com um conjunto de conceitos teoricamente articulados, o que os portugueses querem da democracia e como avaliam o seu regime democrático. A base de trabalho fundamental dos vários capítulos que compõem este livro é um inquérito realizado em Julho de 2011 a uma amostra representativa da população residente em Portugal com 18 ou mais anos.2\n\nOs resultados deste inquérito já foram objecto de um relatório e de uma\n\n2 O inquérito foi realizado pela GfKMetris durante o mês de Julho de 2011, junto de uma amostra representativa da população com 18 ou mais anos residente em Portugal continental, constituída por um total de 1207 inquiridos. Os inquiridos foram seleccionados através do método de quotas, com base numa matriz que cruza as variáveis «sexo», «idade» (sete grupos), «instrução» (dois grupos), Ocupação (dois grupos), «região» (sete regiões GfKMetris) e «habitat/dimensão dos agregados populacionais» (cinco grupos). A informação foi recolhida através de entrevista directa e pessoal, em total privacidade.\n\nIntrodução\n\n23\n\nconferência realizada em 2012.3 Contudo, este livro permitiu uma análise mais aprofundada dos dados e, em vários capítulos, o confronto destes resultados com os de outros projectos e fontes de informação. Para além disso, a estrutura do livro reflecte a «decomposição» do conceito de democracia em várias dimensões distintas, nuns casos compatíveis, noutros casos em «tensão» mútua. O primeiro capítulo, de Luís de Sousa, aborda a dimensão do Estado de direito. Até que ponto consideram os portugueses que os seus direitos fundamentais se encontram garantidos e, em particular, como avaliam o funcionamento do sistema judicial do ponto de vista da sua independência, acesso, equidade, eficiência e eficácia? Os resultados mostram que nem todos estes aspectos suscitam avaliações igualmente negativas, havendo a percepção maioritária de que as decisões são respeitadas e de que os tribunais são independentes em relação ao poder político. No entanto, em geral, os resultados são pouco animadores, e não apenas na «habitual» queixa sobre a falta de rapidez das decisões. Mais preocupante ainda do que a questão da celeridade – uma questão de «eficiência» –, o sistema judicial é visto de forma particularmente crítica em relação à sua (falta de) equidade: três em cada cinco portugueses acham que os cidadãos não são tratados da mesma forma pelos tribunais, variando esse tratamento com o estatuto económico, social e político das partes. Luís de Sousa escreve também sobre a maneira como a experiência directa dos indivíduos com a justiça muda muito pouco estas percepções, assim como sobre o tema da corrupção, visto pelos portugueses como um dos defeitos mais centrais da maneira como funciona a nossa democracia. Marco Lisi, Riccardo Marchi e Ana Maria Evans abordam outra dimensão central da democracia, a participação dos cidadãos. É sabido e demonstrado que os níveis de participação política em Portugal, seja eleitoral, seja, especialmente, não eleitoral, são comparativamente baixos no contexto europeu. Todavia, os autores vão mais longe na explicação das causas desta baixa participação. Lisi, Marchi e Evans mostram como os portugueses têm «uma visão muito negativa no que diz respeito às oportunidades da participação», desconfiando maioritariamente dos tradicionais actores de mobilização, partidos e sindicatos, e preferindo formas de associativismo extrapartidário e extra-sindical. O voto é visto como a forma mais eficaz de participar, em contraste com iniciativas de contacto directo com políticos ou partidos, vistas como ineficazes.\n\n3 A conferência internacional «The quality of the Portuguese democracy in hard times» foi realizada no Instituto de Ciências Sociais da Universidade de Lisboa em 12 de Junho de 2012.\n\nAntónio Costa Pinto, Luís de Sousa e Pedro Magalhães\n\n24\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier abordam o tema da representação política e assim complexificam o diagnóstico anterior. Em primeiro lugar, mostram que o posicionamento ideológico dos eleitores não é indiferente para o seu sentimento e percepção de que se sentem «representados» por um partido político: enquanto a direita partilha essa percepção de forma mais intensa, os indivíduos que se situam à esquerda e (especialmente) ao centro sentem-se menos representados pelos partidos. Enquanto a esquerda tende a encontrar compensação para este défice através da participação associativa e de protesto, o «centro» é um lugar de «alienação, desafeição ou falta de interesse pela política.» Contudo, quando se trata de medir expectativas de que o poder político responda aos interesses e preocupações dos cidadãos de forma sistemática, «o cepticismo detectado entre os inquiridos foi profundo e generalizado.» Em suma, «o que prevalece é uma desorientação profunda no momento de escolher instituições ou agentes que, dentro ou fora do aparelho de Estado, canalizem as suas preocupações, quando os partidos já não se mostrem capazes de o fazer». José Pedro Zúquete aborda a dimensão da responsabilização vertical, ou seja, o controlo que os cidadãos sentem conseguir exercer sobre o poder político em termos de prestação de contas. O capítulo mostra que, apesar da centralidade das eleições na concepção que a esmagadora maioria dos portugueses partilha da democracia e de a maior parte deles sentir a liberdade de voto como estando assegurada, «o voto popular é visto apenas e só como um paliativo, insuficiente» para a responsabilização. Mais de 70% dos inquiridos acham que «os decisores políticos são pouco responsabilizados pelas políticas que implementam». Zúquete fala de uma dupla lógica na necessidade expressa pelos portugueses de ir muito para além das eleições como mecanismo de responsabilização. Uma lógica de transparência, mas também uma lógica de punição, predominando esta última: «más políticas como crimes», uma concepção da responsabilização política hard que parece predominar e a que se chegou, porventura, devido ao falhanço apercebido de formas alternativas e mais compatíveis com a resolução institucionalizada de conflitos em democracia. Precisamente, a responsabilização horizontal, aquela que resulta do controlo mútuo dos poderes do Estado, é o tema abordado por Marcelo Camerlo e Edalina Rodrigues Sanches. Camerlo e Sanches mostram que, do ponto de vista dos cidadãos, é o Presidente de República que tem maior capacidade para (e maior dever de) vigiar a acção dos governos. No entanto, com excepção, precisamente, do Presidente, uma maioria\n\nIntrodução\n\n25\n\ndos inquiridos acha que essa acção é insuficiente por parte dos agentes de controlo. Camerlo e Sanches confrontam ainda estes dados com indicadores objectivos desta actividade de controlo, mostrando como eles são sensíveis a contextos político-institucionais, nomeadamente a relação dos agentes de controlo com as maiorias de governo. Ekaterina Gorbunova e Filipa Raimundo analisam a protecção de direitos e liberdades como dimensão fundamental da democracia. Este é um dos pontos em que, do ponto de vista dos cidadãos, se pode dizer que a avaliação é mais positiva. O direito de voto, a liberdade religiosa e a liberdade de associação são aspectos que a grande maioria dos portugueses vê como assegurados no nosso país. Contudo, mesmo aqui há pontos problemáticos. Liberdade de expressão, presunção de inocência e, especialmente, garantias de não discriminação e protecção em relação a abusos policiais são aspectos bem mais problemáticos. Tal como indicam as autoras, «como sugere a leitura dos relatórios da FH e do Departamento de Estado norte-americano», este é um caso em que as percepções dos cidadãos coincidem bem com os dados objectivos. Filipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço analisam os direitos sociais. Mostram, em primeiro lugar, como estes direitos parecem fazer parte da concepção que os portugueses têm de democracia, mesmo que, do ponto de vista teórico ou normativo, muitos considerem que eles ultrapassam a dimensão estritamente procedimental do conceito. Segundo, e em contraste com outros países, a cultura política portuguesa parece ser caracterizada por um sentimento forte de empatia com os mais pobres e valores fortemente igualitários e favoráveis ao papel redistributivo do Estado, especialmente predominantes (mas longe de serem exclusivos) entre os indivíduos que se situam à esquerda do ponto de vista ideológico. Finalmente, «há uma diferença significativa entre, por um lado, a importância atribuída aos direitos sociais e, por outro, o grau percebido da sua garantia, [que ]parece sugerir uma apreensão generalizada quanto à capacidade de o Estado social satisfazer as suas promessas». Os autores concluem que, «sendo que os portugueses colocam a garantia de um nível condigno de vida no topo das exigências que fazem à democracia, esta avaliação claramente negativa do desempenho das suas funções sociais pode vir a ter repercussões na legitimidade que atribuem ao próprio regime democrático». Marina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva abordam a dimensão da responsividade, ou seja, a forma como as instituições políticas de facto implementam decisões que reflectem as preferências dos cidadãos. Os autores, discutindo o conceito e analisando dados se António Costa Pinto, Luís de Sousa e Pedro Magalhães\n\n26\n\ncundários relevantes, mostram que Portugal, em conjunto com os restantes países da Europa do Sul, tem indicadores de baixa qualidade das políticas públicas, que têm vindo a cair na última década. Essa tendência reflecte-se nas próprias percepções dos cidadãos: «apenas um em cada três portugueses encontra-se satisfeito com o funcionamento da sua democracia; e apenas 10% consideram que os políticos têm em conta as opiniões do cidadão comum». A única diferença é que a deterioração ao longo do tempo tem sido «muito mais rápida da avaliação dos portugueses do que as avaliações externas e os dados objectivos». Pedro Magalhães, no último capítulo, discute as consequências disto para o apoio à democracia enquanto regime, ou seja, a percepção de que é o «único regime legítimo». O inquérito de 2011 detectou um valor surpreendentemente baixo – em comparação com o passado – de inquiridos dispostos a afirmarem que «a democracia é preferível a qualquer outra forma de governo». O que significa isto? Magalhães, utilizando indicadores do World Values Survey, permitindo a comparação de dezenas de países, mostra que os indicadores de qualidade da governação têm um efeito muito importante sobre o apoio dos cidadãos ao regime. Ao contrário da ideia feita de que esse apoio é um dado cultural ou social construído a longo prazo, os dados mostram que a crença na superioridade da democracia como regime é afectada pelo seu desempenho e pela efectividade das políticas. Portugal permanece, do ponto de vista do seu nível de desenvolvimento económico, bem acima do limiar considerado «perigoso» para a sobrevivência de um regime democrático. Para além disso, a consolidação da democracia depende em grande medida das acções das elites políticas, e não há em Portugal sérios partidos anti-sistema. Contudo, do ponto de vista do apoio popular, há sinais claros de que a legitimidade do regime democrático já foi mais prevalecente do que é hoje. Este é o sinal claro e preocupante com que termina este volume e cujas razões profundas são exploradas ao longo de todos os seus capítulos.\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nBeetham, D., ed. 1994.

A primeira questão que se levanta é a de definir o que é um Estado de direito democrático; a segunda é a de procurar saber porquê o Estado de direito é essencial para a democracia. O Estado de direito é uma figura jurídica, circunscrita a uma comunidade politicamente constituída num contexto espacial e temporal, na qual os detentores do poder se encontram sujeitos à Constituição e às leis promulgadas, onde existe uma separação efectiva de poderes e o respeito pelos direitos, liberdades e garantias fundamentais dos cidadãos. Os limites e as regras para o exercício do poder estatal (onde se inscrevem as chamadas «garantias fundamentais») encontram-se consignados numa constituição democraticamente aceite, ainda que não necessariamente referendada. Em democracia, apenas o direito positivo, codificado e aprovado pelo poder legislativo poderá limitar a acção do Estado e dos seus representantes. Existem outras fontes de direito (nomeadamente o direito canónico ou natural), mas numa sociedade democrática só o direito positivo é aceite como norma e só esse poderá ser invocado nos tribunais para garantir o chamado «império da lei».\n\nO Estado de direito democrático não pode prescindir da existência de uma constituição, mas as constituições, tal como as eleições, não são exclusivas das democracias. O Estado Novo foi, provavelmente, dos regimes autoritários que mais eleições realizaram e possuía igualmente uma constituição referendada. Portanto, o cerne da questão não está em saber se o Estado de direito, enquanto império da lei, pode existir sem democracia, mas se as democracias podem sobreviver sem um Estado de direito democraticamente legitimado e funcional. Este capítulo pretende avaliar a importância do Estado de direito no imaginário democrático dos portugueses e está organizado em partes: a primeira discute a natureza contratual do Estado de direito e a sua importância para a qualidade da democracia; a segunda discute os dois problemas de fundo através dos quais os cidadãos avaliam a qualidade do Estado de direito – o redimensionamento dos direitos e garantias sociais dos cidadãos e o funcionamento da justiça; por último, são avaliadas as percepções dos cidadãos sobre estas duas dimensões do desempenho do Estado de direito, com enfoque na face mais visível da justiça, que são os tribunais, em particular no que concerne à sua eficácia em matéria de combate da corrupção.\n\nNatureza contratual do Estado de direito e sua importância para a qualidade da democracia\n\nEm democracia, o Estado de direito é, por definição, um Estado contratual. Não na interpretação individualista dada pelas teorias contratualistas de Hobbes (1651) e Locke (1689), pois não se trata de um acordo firmado entre indivíduos conscientes que decidem abdicar, em parte ou no todo, da sua liberdade e arbítrio para que outrem o exerça, mas numa acepção contratual pluralista, onde os diversos grupos que compõem a sociedade procuram fiscalizar e influenciar-se uns aos outros, de forma que as decisões não sejam tomadas unilateralmente de uma forma abusiva. Historicamente, a realização do Estado de direito resulta da iniciativa de um grupo, num determinado contexto social e territorial, se sobrepor aos demais e estipular, mediante um processo constituinte, um conjunto de princípios, regras, instituições e processos que instituam uma entidade\n\nLuís de Sousa\n\n30\n\nEstado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\nsoberana, reconhecida e aceite pelos restantes grupos dessa comunidade e pelos demais Estados na ordem internacional, como uma entidade idónea e viável para garantir uma convivência pacífica, o progresso das suas populações e o respeito pelo primado do direito. Porém, a maior ou menor participação dos vários grupos nesse processo constituinte, a maior ou menor inclusão de diferentes perspectivas da natureza e alcance do Estado, irão determinar o grau de aceitação do texto constitucional e da legitimidade do Estado. Convém não esquecer que o Estado de direito detém o monopólio de coerção legítima sobre os indivíduos. Contudo, a sua legitimidade não se deve resumir à capacidade coerciva de efectivar os direitos, liberdades e garantias dos cidadãos. A legitimidade deste monopólio está dependente de uma noção de supremacia do direito e de «autoridade racional-legal» assente, por um lado, em leis universais, objectivas, duráveis, do conhecimento dos cidadãos e sem aplicações retroactivas discricionárias e, por outro lado, em regras impessoais do exercício do poder que restringem a discricionariedade das elites políticas e burocráticas e fazem com que os cidadãos obedeçam às decisões imbuídas de legalidade, sem colocarem em questão a autoridade ou legitimidade dos que decidem e, portanto, sem haver necessidade de essas recorrerem ao aparelho coercivo do Estado para impor as suas decisões. Num Estado de direito democrático, as decisões não têm de necessariamente ser tomadas em função do todo, ou com externalidades positivas para o grosso das populações, para que sejam tidas como constitucionalmente válidas. Da mesma forma, nem todas as decisões têm de ser voluntariamente acatadas pelos destinatários. Deste modo, a legitimidade do actual Estado de direito democrático resulta de um equilíbrio, por vezes frágil, entre uma disputa de poder constante (mas regulada) de diferentes grupos de interesses e um compromisso histórico entre esses mesmos grupos assente na partilha de uma ideia de comunidade a realizar intemporalmente num determinado território. Na maioria dos casos, esse compromisso histórico encontra-se consagrado numa convenção ou constituição imbuída de uma série de direitos, liberdades e garantias que permitem ao cidadão o desenvolvimento das suas capacidades humanas, sociais, económicas, políticas e culturais e de deveres e obrigações que o tornam responsável perante os seus actos e as suas consequências para os demais e a comunidade como um todo. Os princípios que estão na base do bom funcionamento do Estado de direito democrático são bastante consensuais na literatura (Beetham 1994 e 2005; O’Donnell 2004; Diamond e Morlino 2005; Morlino 2006).\n\n31\n\nEntre outros:\n\n• A equidade. Todos os cidadãos devem ser tratados da mesma forma perante a lei e o aparelho de justiça, independentemente do seu estatuto económico, social ou político (todos iguais perante a lei e ninguém acima da lei); • A universalidade. Os direitos, liberdades e garantias atribuídos às pessoas individuais e colectivas e inscritos na constituição e nas leis do país deverão ser protegidos em todas as circunstâncias; • A supremacia da lei. A legalidade do Estado de direito é suprema na ordem interna, o que significa que não deverá haver áreas ou actividades dominadas por interesses ilegítimos ou pela corrupção, e voluntariamente partilhada na ordem externa, no que concerne à adopção de convenções e mecanismos de controlo da criminalidade transnacional; • O acesso. O acesso à justiça deve ser garantido a todos os cidadãos, quer se trate de litígios do foro privado ou entre cidadãos e o Estado; • A celeridade. As pessoas individuais e colectivas têm direito a uma resolução célere e eficiente dos seus litígios judiciais, civis ou administrativos; • A independência. A justiça deve ser aplicada de uma forma objectiva, protegida de quaisquer influências (políticas, económicas ou outras) que possam ferir a imparcialidade das decisões das autoridades e agentes da justiça ou incitar à sua omissão; • A eficácia. A justiça deve ser capaz de impor as suas decisões de uma forma coerente e eficaz, sancionando os infractores e ressarcindo as vítimas.\n\nImportância do Estado de direito para a qualidade da democracia\n\nO Estado de direito é tão indispensável à avaliação/medição da qualidade da democracia como a igualdade, a liberdade, a participação, a representação, a responsabilidade e responsividade dos eleitos e a eficácia (Beetham 1994 e 2005; Vanhanen 1997; Altman e Pérez-Liñán 2002; Diamond e Morlino 2005; Andreev 2005; Berg-Schlosser 2006; Ringen 2007; Bühlmann et al. 2007; Landman 2008). O funcionamento do Estado de direito está interligado com as demais dimensões da qualidade da democracia: a liberdade, igualdade e responsabilização dos agentes não serão\n\nLuís de Sousa\n\n32\n\nEstado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\npossíveis se não existir um sistema judicial funcional e eficaz que assegure o respeito pela constituição e pela lei por todos os cidadãos, independentemente do seu estatuto social (Morlino 2006, 8). Para Larry Diamond e Leonardo Morlino (2005, XI) a qualidade da democracia pode ser definida como um regime complexo e multidimensional que proporciona um elevado grau de liberdade, igualdade política e controlo popular sobre os decisores e os processos de decisão aos cidadãos, através do funcionamento legítimo e legal de instituições estáveis. Esta definição centra o conceito de democracia num conjunto de regras, processos e instituições que, historicamente, têm colocado em prática os valores da democracia com maior ou menor sucesso, ignorando, porém, a dimensão subjectiva da qualidade da democracia e o entendimento que os cidadãos fazem desses mesmos mecanismos formais e dos valores que lhes subjazem. Como relembra Andreas Schedler, no mundo social as instituições são também, ou sobretudo, «interlocking and selfreinforcing patterns of expectations» (2007, 31). Por outras palavras, a qualidade da democracia nada mais é do que um bricabraque de emoções e expectativas que se forma entre a inevitável escassez e a infindável insatisfação, quer do ponto de vista material, quer do ponto de vista normativo. Raramente existe uma correspondência directa entre o formato e desempenho das instituições democráticas e as expectativas dos cidadãos. Na sua interacção diária com as instituições públicas, os cidadãos avaliam de que forma um parlamento satisfaz as suas expectativas enquanto órgão representativo e legislador, qual a eficácia do governo em responder às suas necessidades e problemas, qual o papel do provedor de Justiça em assegurar uma aplicação uniforme dos procedimentos administrativos e salvaguardar os direitos dos cidadãos face ao aparelho do Estado e de que forma é feita justiça nos e pelos tribunais. Por este motivo, não seria rigoroso avaliar a qualidade do Estado de direito apenas por critérios objectivos, como o tipo de apoio judiciário providenciado aos cidadãos, o montante das custas judiciais, o número de processos transitados em tribunal, o volume de condenações, os tempos de resposta dos tribunais, a sua eficácia na aplicação das decisões tomadas, etc. As experiências e avaliações que os cidadãos fazem do desempenho diário do complexo de regras e instituições que constituem a democracia são fundamentais para a avaliação da sua qualidade. Como concluem Carolyn Logan e Robert Mattes (2012, 471), «democratic quality is only knowable from the eye of the beholder». Os cidadãos podem ter perspectivas muito diversificadas, fluidas e até contraditórias do que é a democracia. Podem não ter\n\n33\n\numa visão muito clara do imaginário político, isto é, da democracia que ambicionam, mas sabem certamente avaliar o que lhes falta. As democracias procuram dar resposta aos anseios dos cidadãos, atribuindo-lhes uma série de direitos, liberdades e garantias, mas, ao fazê-lo, colocam imensas restrições à capacidade de os governos assegurarem a sua efectivação (Plattner 2005, 78). Governar é gerir a escassez e complexidade social. Isto significa que muitas vezes é necessário criar prioridades e ser selectivo em relação às demandas dos cidadãos. Esta maior ou menor capacidade de garantir, por via de políticas ou da acção judicial, os direitos dos cidadãos afectará os seus julgamentos sobre o desempenho da democracia. Por conseguinte, o desempenho da dimensão do Estado de direito importa para a qualidade da democracia: quanto mais democrático for o Estado de direito, isto é, quanto mais equitativo, abrangente, imparcial, independente, célere e eficaz, mais sólida será a legitimidade popular da democracia. O Estado de direito é, provavelmente, a dimensão mais basilar de todas. Sem a existência de um Estado de direito eficaz: a participação dos cidadãos na vida política é obstaculizada ou pode até ser suprimida; os direitos, liberdades e garantias são mera semântica; os mais poderosos vêm o seu poder de influência crescer, capturando os processos de decisão; a maioria eleita torna-se exclusiva e abusiva no exercício do poder, reduzindo os direitos das minorias a um incómodo, facilmente descartável através dos mecanismos coercivos do próprio Estado; o conceito de legalidade fica reduzido ao último reduto em democracia, que é a punição eleitoral, historicamente insuficiente para assegurar a responsabilização dos eleitos. Contudo, importa sublinhar que a realização do Estado de direito não pode ser um fim em si mesma. O conceito de qualidade da democracia não só pressupõe ganhos mútuos entre as várias dimensões, como também pode significar alguma sobreposição e compromisso na sua efectivação. A procura de um melhor e mais eficaz Estado de direito pode acarretar consequências para as demais dimensões. Por exemplo, a adopção de uma determinada moldura penal, como o enriquecimento ilícito, pode trazer ganhos do ponto de vista da eficácia da justiça e por conseguinte da legitimação popular dos agentes e autoridades responsáveis pela sua aplicação (isto é, procuradores, juízes e tribunais), mas pode igualmente significar uma redução das garantias de presunção de inocência e da liberdade e privacidade dos indivíduos. Da mesma forma, a introdução de um efeito devolutivo ao recurso para os casos de criminalidade complexa julgados em tribunais de 1.ª instância ajuda a recuperar a cre Luís de Sousa\n\n34\n\nEstado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\ndibilidade do Estado de direito – um Esta do de direito que não consegue punir eficazmente a corrupção é um Estado de direito semântico –, mas acarreta consigo custos do ponto de vista das liberdades e garantias dos indivíduos. A adopção deste tipo de medidas «musculadas» deve resultar de uma ponderação entre dois bens jurídicos dignos de tutela através da imposição de uma restrição mais intensa a uma garantia constitucional em matéria de direitos, liberdades e garantias para preservação do próprio Estado de direito. Em todo o caso, trata-se sempre de uma escolha da sociedade em relação ao tipo de democracia que pretende efectivar.\n\nUm Estado de direito em redefinição\n\nO Estado de direito não é um produto, mas um processo em constante redefinição. Na actual conjuntura de austeridade, o debate sobre o futuro do Estado de direito desenvolve-se em redor de duas questões: (1) o problema da redução de direitos sociais, inserida num debate mais amplo de redimensionamento do Estado-Providência; (2) o problema do governo da justiça, em particular do seu desempenho.\n\nO downsizing dos direitos e as garantias sociais dos cidadãos\n\nProteger e garantir os direitos individuais no âmbito do Estado de direito é uma das condições mínimas para a existência de regimes democráticos (Beetham 1994 e 2005; Bühlmann et al. 2011). Do ponto de vista formal, a Constituição da República Portuguesa de 1974 apresenta um articulado de princípios fundamentais (artigos 1.º a 23.º) e direitos, liberdades e garantias (artigos 24.º a 57.º) bastante inovador e ambicioso que em nada compromete a sua qualidade jurídica quando confrontada com a de outras constituições democráticas. Porém, no que concerne à sua prática, os resultados têm sido menos auspiciosos. O hiato entre os direitos e garantias dos cidadãos consagrados na Constituição e a sua efectivação na realidade não é de agora, mas tem ganho maior relevância social no actual contexto de crise económica e financeira. O esforço de reequilíbrio das finanças públicas a que a democracia portuguesa tem estado sujeita reacendeu um velho debate sobre a requalificação do Estado de direito democrático e das funções que este deve cumprir. Por outras palavras, o problema de fundo está em saber se o\n\n35\n\ncerne da acção do Estado de direito democrático consiste na protecção dos cidadãos contra a prepotência, o arbítrio e a injustiça dos poderes do Estado (legislativo, executivo e judicial) e de outros poderes existentes em sociedade, nomeadamente o poder económico, ou se se estende também à definição de um modelo de vida e formas de mobilidade social para a sociedade em questão (Berger e Luckman 1997, 95-103). A multiplicação de funções e o crescimento do aparelho do Estado, tal como o conhecemos hoje, devem-se, em grande medida, à necessidade de acompanhar e regular a crescente complexidade das relações sociais e económicas. Ao início tudo era mais simples, mas também mais precário. O Estado não prometia aquilo que não podia prover, mas também não gerava a solidariedade necessária à sua legitimação. O Estado de direito do século XX incorporou novas funções sociais (educação, saúde, cultura, previdência e assistência social, ciência, etc.) e novas actividades económicas (a produção e gestão de determinados bens e serviços essenciais, a regulação do sistema económico e financeiro interno, a definição de uma política monetária e cambial, o estabelecimento de relações comerciais internacionais, etc.). Este processo de democratização do Estado conduziu a uma concepção mais ampla dos direitos e garantias fundamentais dos cidadãos que vai além da protecção da liberdade e da propriedade privada contra a prepotência e arbitrariedade do soberano e inclui também a defesa de direitos sociais e políticos. É precisamente a natureza e alcance da dimensão social do Estado de direito democrático que hoje está em discussão.\n\nA eterna crise da justiça\n\nNuma sociedade democrática, a justiça ocupa um lugar cimeiro na resolução de conflitos resultantes das múltiplas e complexas relações interpessoais, das transacções comerciais e do relacionamento dos cidadãos e das empresas com o Estado. Por esta razão, a avaliação que os cidadãos fazem do desempenho do aparelho de justiça é central para a legitimidade do regime democrático. Infelizmente, o desfasamento entre o imaginário de justiça e a sua prática tem sido uma constante nos últimos 36 anos de democracia. Não obstante o artigo 20.º da nossa Constituição garantir a todos os cidadãos igual acesso ao direito e aos tribunais para defesa dos seus direitos e interesses, não podendo a justiça ser denegada por insuficiência de meios económicos, na prática, os níveis de apoio e patrocínio judiciário presta Luís de Sousa\n\n36\n\nEstado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\ndos aos cidadãos são escassos. Os cidadãos com menos possibilidades financeiras e cognitivas sentem-se mais desprotegidos, o que resulta numa percepção de tratamento diferenciado perante a justiça. Para a maioria dos cidadãos existe uma justiça para os ricos e influentes e uma justiça para os pobres e pequenos delinquentes (de Sousa e Triães 2008, 116-117). A Constituição também garante que todos tenham direito a que uma causa em que intervenham seja objecto de decisão em prazo razoável e mediante processo equitativo; porém, a justiça portuguesa é lenta e as decisões não são tomadas nem cumpridas em tempo útil (Gomes 2011, 11). O artigo 22.º sobre a responsabilidade das entidades públicas dispõe que o Estado e as demais entidades públicas sejam civilmente responsáveis, em forma solidária com os titulares dos seus órgãos, funcionários ou agentes, por acções ou omissões praticadas no exercício das suas funções e por causa desse exercício, de que resulte violação dos direitos, liberdades e garantias ou prejuízo para outrem; contudo, a probabilidade de vencer uma causa contra o Estado nos tribunais e de obter uma indemnização é quase nula para o comum dos mortais. Estes e outros problemas relativos ao desempenho da justiça têm sido objecto de reflexão por parte dos sucessivos governos e, em particular, pela Presidência da República, mas as reformas encetadas têm tocado o problema apenas superficialmente. Aquilo a que assistimos, vezes sem conta, é a uma intensificação do discurso governamental de modernização do sistema judicial que não tem correspondência com a realidade. Como refere Nuno Garoupa, o paradigma da reforma da justiça manteve-se inalterado nas últimas décadas e replicou, sistematicamente, o mesmo tipo de erros: «concentrou-se em excesso em pequenas medidas que conjunturalmente podem até aliviar o problema da celeridade», mas que a longo prazo «não permitem certamente estruturar uma alternativa que possa sustentar uma melhoria da qualidade, equidade e eficácia da justiça em Portugal» (2011, 16). A crise da justiça tem assumido um carácter quase permanente. As razões são multifacetadas, mas o principal problema de fundo é a manifesta ausência de governo da justiça. A justiça é o sector de actividade do Estado que está mais entregue a si mesmo e onde quem menos manda, por opção ou incompetência, é o ministro detentor da pasta. A justiça portuguesa tem sido palco de inúmeras e infrutíferas disputas corporativas, sujeita a uma infindável sequência de pequenas reformas inconsistentes, não estruturadas e sem planeamento (Garoupa 2011, 16-17). Esta inoperância da justiça é bem conhecida dos portugueses. As representações sociais dos cidadãos sobre o direito e a justiça em Portugal não sofreram mudanças significativas ao longo dos anos. Diversos estu 37\n\ndos realizados sobre esta matéria revelam resultados convergentes e opiniões relativamente resistentes ao tempo e às mudanças contextuais (Hespanha 2005, 117).\n\nPercepções dos cidadãos sobre o Estado de direito em Portugal\n\nO Estado de direito é um dos pontos mais críticos do desempenho da democracia portuguesa. A avaliação que os portugueses fazem do Estado de direito continua perigosamente negativa e os factores mais críticos que justificam esse descontentamento têm a ver, por um lado, com uma crescente insatisfação com os níveis de protecção dos direitos e garantias sociais dos cidadãos e, por outro lado, com o desempenho da justiça, nomeadamente a celeridade e a equidade das decisões dos tribunais, sobretudo no que concerne ao combate à criminalidade complexa e com maior impacto social. A análise que se segue incide sobre dois níveis de avaliação que os portugueses fazem sobre a qualidade do Estado de direito: (1) no que concerne à protecção dos seus direitos, liberdade e garantias e no que diz respeito ao desempenho da justiça, em geral, e (2) ao funcionamento dos tribunais, em particular. Os dados são da autoria do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» do Instituto de Ciências Sociais da Universidade de Lisboa e foram obtidos através da realização de um inquérito face-to-face a uma amostra representativa da população portuguesa.\n\nUma democracia mais formal do que substantiva\n\nNão obstante as garantias formais que a democracia portuguesa oferece do ponto de vista do exercício dos direitos e liberdades individuais serem avaliadas positivamente, quando se trata de efectivar na prática esses mesmos direitos e liberdades, a democracia portuguesa apresenta inúmeras inconsistências. Quando os direitos individuais não são efectivamente garantidos nem por políticas concretas nem pelos tribunais, a descrença e a desconfiança dos cidadãos no funcionamento do Estado de direito são agudizadas (Benavente et al. 1997, 109). Apenas o direito e liberdade de voto (63%), de religião (60%) e de associação (50%) reúnem um consenso alargado quanto à sua efectivação. Já no que diz respeito à liberdade de expressão (41%), ao direito à presunção de inocência (40%) e ao direito à privacidade (38%), são menos de metade os inquiridos que consideram que estes direitos, liberdades e\n\nLuís de Sousa\n\n38\n\nEstado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\ngarantias são «totalmente» ou «muito» garantidos pelo Estado. Mas é sobretudo em relação ao direito de não sofrer abusos policiais (35%) ou de não ser discriminado (33%) que os portugueses estão mais cépticos em relação à actuação do Estado de direito (figura 1.1). A realização de uma sociedade solidária e justa é central no imaginário democrático dos portugueses: a maioria dos cidadãos considera que para que haja democracia é necessário haver um nível de bem-estar mínimo (nível de vida digno) para todos os cidadãos (52%) e um sistema judicial que trate todos da mesma forma (52%). Onde o Estado de direito tem sido menos garantista é ao nível do combate à discriminação e do respeito pelos direitos sociais. Os portugueses estão cientes de que persistem discriminações que dificultam a participação das minorias (48%) e das mulheres (41%) na vida política. A opinião geral em relação à garantia de direitos sociais no nosso país é bastante negativa. Contudo, é no direito à habitação e no direito às prestações sociais que a discrepância entre satisfeitos e insatisfeitos é mais acentuada. O direito à educação é o único domínio onde a percentagem\n\n39\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\n63\n\n60\n\n50\n\n41\n\n40\n\n38\n\n35\n\n33\n\nO direito de cada um a votar em quem quiser sem ser pressionado\n\nO direito de cada um a praticar a sua religião, se a tiver\n\nO direito de cada um a juntar-se à associação ou organização que entenda O direito de cada um a dizer publicamente aquilo que pensa sem temer represálias\n\nO direito a ser considerado inocente até prova em contrário\n\nO direito de cada um a não sofrer abusos policiais\n\nO direito de cada um à sua privacidade\n\nO direito de não ser discriminado por razões de sexo, raça, religião ou outras\n\nFigura 1.1 – Até que ponto estão garantidos os direitos e liberdades individuais; percentagem das pessoas que consideram os direitos «muito/bastante garantidos»\n\ndos que consideram que esse direito está totalmente ou muito garantido supera a percentagem dos insatisfeitos (figura 1.2).\n\nO fraco desempenho da justiça\n\nUma ordem jurídica que não providencia a todos os seus cidadãos a possibilidade de recorrerem aos tribunais para resolução dos seus conflitos de uma forma célere, equitativa e imparcial corre o risco de ser ajuizada negativamente. A percepção dos cidadãos sobre o funcionamento da justiça foi medida através de cinco dimensões de desempenho baseadas na literatura (quadro 1.1):\n\n• Acesso. O acesso à justiça é considerado no ordenamento jurídico português um direito fundamental, direito esse que vem previsto no artigo 20.º da CRP. O principal meio de que o cidadão dispõe para efectivar o seu direito ao acesso à justiça é o acesso aos tribunais judiciais, por via da proposição de acções nos tribunais competentes para concretizar as suas pretensões. Dois dos problemas comummente identificados no acesso à justiça têm a ver com a capacidade de os cidadãos conhecerem os pontos de entrada e funcionamento do sistema judicial que permitam uma defesa dos seus direitos e os custos inerentes à utilização do sistema judicial. A justiça está muitas vezes organizada de uma forma labiríntica, pouco compreensível para a maioria dos cidadãos, inclusive os que têm competências literárias mais elevadas. Os custos da justiça constituem um dos prin Luís de Sousa\n\n40\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n33 19\n\n24 30\n\n55 9\n\n43\n\nO direito à saúde\n\nO direito à educação\n\nO direito à habitação\n\nO direito à segurança social 16\n\nPouco/nada garantido Totalmente/muito garantido\n\nFigura 1.2 – Garantia dos direitos sociais dos portugueses\n\nEstado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\n41\n\ncipais impedimentos à sua utilização pelos cidadãos. O pagamento de taxas de justiça e dos honorários dos defensores (advogados) não está ao alcance da carteira de todos os cidadãos. Para colmatar este problema, os Estados de direito conferem aos seus cidadãos mecanismos de informação e protecção jurídica gratuitos ou em condições favoráveis para cidadãos carenciados; 1\n\n• Equidade. A capacidade de a justiça tratar da mesma forma todos os cidadãos, independentemente do seu estatuto económico, social ou político, é a dimensão mais problemática da avaliação do seu desempenho nos últimos tempos. Como refere Conceição Gomes, «o combate à corrupção e, em geral, à criminalidade económica grave e complexa, envolvendo pessoas social e politicamente poderosas, tem vindo a expor os tribunais judiciais a um tipo de protagonismo para o qual nem sempre estavam preparados» (2011, 27). Sempre que a justiça se depara com casos que envolvem figuras públicas, nomeadamente titulares ou candidatos a cargos públicos, partidos políticos ou pessoas, individuais ou colectivas, do mundo dos negócios, a percepção generalizada é a de que a legalidade perde contra o poder de influência. Num inquérito de opinião intitulado Corrupção e Ética em Democracia: o Caso de Portugal, realizado em 2006 a uma amostra representativa da população portuguesa, a maioria dos portugueses considera que a justiça é pouco severa com os membros do governo (87%), deputados da AR (85%), dirigentes desportivos (85%) e presidentes de câmara (78%). Os chefes de empresa integram também este grupo, ainda que com um valor menos acentuado (73%). Em contrapartida, a mão pesada da lei faz-se sentir no caso dos cidadãos comuns e dos pequenos delinquentes, embora seja o cidadão comum quem mais sofre com os excessos da justiça (30,5% muito severa, contra os 17,7% expressos para os pequenos delinquentes). Existe, no entendimento dos cidadãos, um sentimento de inoperância da justiça, que se materializa em sentimentos de impunidade e injustiça social (de Sousa e Triães 2008); • Independência. A percepção de que a aplicação da lei pelos tribunais é sistematicamente mais assertiva em relação ao pequeno delinquente do que em relação aos poderosos não é apenas um problema\n\n1 No caso português este procedimento de ajuda é feito pelos moldes de acesso ao direito previstos na lei (Decreto-Lei n.º 34/2004, de 29 de Julho). Compete aos serviços da segurança social apreciar os pedidos de assistência jurídica.\n\nde equidade, mas também de independência daquelas instâncias onde o Estado depositou competências judiciais. A perceptível falta de independência dos tribunais em relação a interesses económicos e pressões políticas faz-se sobretudo sentir ao nível do combate à corrupção, prejudicando gravemente a percepção do funcionamento da justiça. Quando a justiça perde a noção dos critérios de imparcialidade e veracidade, o Estado de direito sucumbe; • Celeridade/eficiência. A lentidão da justiça é um obstáculo à efectivação de direitos. «Justiça tardia é justiça denegada», ou seja, «um sistema judicial que sistematicamente se atrasa nas suas decisões é, apenas por essa razão, um sistema injusto» (Gomes 2011, 110). Os atrasos excessivos na efectivação de direitos pela via judicial leva a que seja impossível concretizar a justiça num Estado de direito, tanto pelo prazo excessivo que decorre desde que um acidentado recebe uma indemnização ou um credor vê liquidada a sua dívida por via judicial como pelo prazo excessivo em que um criminoso seria condenado (daí a existência de prazos de prescrição específicos quanto à responsabilidade criminal). A dimensão temporal é, por estas razões, essencial na avaliação que os cidadãos fazem da eficiência da justiça; • Eficácia. O nível de apoio e aceitação do Estado de direito democrático por parte dos cidadãos depende, cada vez mais, dos níveis de eficácia do aparelho de justiça, em particular dos tribunais. A decisão judiciária tem como objectivo resolver um diferendo jurídico e melhorar a qualidade de vida dos cidadãos. Uma aparelho judicial incapaz de punir, ressarcir e fazer respeitar as suas decisões é, por definição, impotente.\n\nÀs várias dimensões ou princípios do bom funcionamento do Estado de direito correspondem indicadores de percepção específicos. Importa sublinhar que esta análise do desempenho da justiça através de indicadores subjectivos incide apenas nos factores que estão directamente relacionados com o funcionamento dos tribunais, ficando por tratar outros que dizem respeito à formação, estatuto social e modos de pensar dos profissionais da justiça, ao formalismo dos procedimentos judiciais e à tecnicidade do discurso jurídico, que acabam também por influenciar negativamente a percepção dos cidadãos (Guibentif 2003), assim como a predisposição dos cidadãos para respeitar/violar a lei (de Sousa 2009). A avaliação global que os portugueses fazem do funcionamento dos tribunais é bastante negativa, confirmando os dados de estudos anteriores (Santos et al. 1996; Benavente et al. 1997; Hespanha 2005; Magalhães\n\nLuís de Sousa\n\n42\n\nEstado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\n2009). Porém, confirma-se que nem todas as dimensões de desempenho analisadas suscitam o mesmo nível de descontentamento por parte dos cidadãos (figura 1.3):\n\n• 59% dos inquiridos entendem que os cidadãos não são tratados da mesma forma pelos tribunais e que o seu estatuto económico, social ou político tem um peso nesse tratamento diferenciado; • Cumulativamente, 54% consideram que as decisões judiciais são tão lentas que não vale a pena recorrer aos tribunais; • Ao nível da independência dos tribunais, o Estado de direito parece estar mais precavido em relação à influência do poder político do que do poder económico: se 45% dos inquiridos temem que as decisões dos tribunais não são tomadas com independência em relação aos interesses económicos, apenas 41% têm a mesma opinião em relação à capacidade de influência do poder político; • Nas três dimensões de eficácia da justiça – eficácia para punir os infractores, ressarcir as vítimas e fazer cumprir as decisões dos tribunais –\n\n43\n\nQuadro 1.1 – Dimensões e indicadores subjectivos do desempenho da justiça\n\nDimensões Indicadores\n\nAcesso O Estado dá um apoio satisfatório para o acesso à justiça\n\nEquidade Todos os cidadãos, independentemente do seu estatuto económico, social ou político, são tratados da mesma forma pelos tribunais\n\nIndependência Interesses económicos As decisões dos tribunais são tomadas com independência em relação aos interesses económicos\n\nInteresses políticos As decisões dos tribunais são tomadas com independência em relação aos interesses políticos\n\nCeleridade/eficiência As decisões dos tribunais são tão lentas que não vale a pena recorrer aos tribunais\n\nEficácia Capacidade de punição A justiça é eficaz na punição dos infractores\n\nCapacidade de ressarcir A justiça é eficaz na compensação dos males causados às vítimas\n\nCapacidade de fazer De um modo geral, as decisões dos tribunais respeitar decisões são respeitadas (enforcement)\n\napenas no que concerne a esta última, a opinião pública ainda mantém uma percepção mais positiva (36%) do que negativa (25%).\n\nImporta sublinhar que a percepção dos cidadãos sobre o funcionamento dos tribunais é feita através de uma implicação directa do indivíduo num processo judicial ou da sua observação distanciada, em que o indivíduo recebe informações sobre a actividade dos tribunais, não tendo qualquer experiência directa com o seu funcionamento (Guibentif 2003). No primeiro caso, a experiência de contacto directo com os tribunais é assimilada de maneira muito diferente, dependendo das competências cognitivas e do estatuto social dos indivíduos envolvidos. No segundo caso, a percepção dos cidadãos sobre o funcionamento dos tribunais é construída através da informação, obtida de várias fontes. Atendendo à centralidade dos órgãos de comunicação social (televisão e imprensa) nas práticas comunicativas e no quotidiano dos cidadãos, não é de estranhar que sejam as fontes de informação mais utilizadas pelos portugueses na formulação das suas opiniões sobre a justiça e o funcionamento dos\n\nLuís de Sousa\n\n44\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\n59\n\n54\n\n52\n\n51\n\n50\n\n45\n\n41\n\n25\n\nTodos os cidadãos, independentemente do seu estatuto económico, social ou político, são tratados da mesma forma pelos tribunais As decisões dos tribunais são tão lentas que não vale a pena recorrer aos tribunais (muito de acordo/de acordo) A justiça é eficaz na compensação dos males causados às vítimas\n\nA justiça é eficaz na punição dos infractores\n\nO Estado dá um apoio satisfatório para o acesso à justiça\n\nAs decisões dos tribunais são tomadas com independência em relação aos interesses políticos\n\nAs decisões dos tribunais são tomadas com independência em relação aos interesses económicos\n\nDe um modo geral, as decisões dos tribunais são respeitadas\n\nFigura 1.3 – Percepções dos portugueses sobre o desempenho da justiça\n\nEstado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\ntribunais, em particular (Ewick e Silbey 1998; Guibentif et al. 2002; Guibentif 2003; de Sousa e Triães 2007). Neste sentido, introduziu-se, no inquérito em análise, uma variável de controlo: perguntou-se aos inquiridos se já estiveram perante um tribunal na qualidade de parte de um processo. A maioria dos portugueses (79%) afirma nunca ter tido uma experiência directa com a justiça, sendo a percentagem daqueles que já fizeram parte de um processo inferior a um quinto da população (18%). Decidiu-se cruzar as várias dimensões de desempenho dos tribunais com esta variável de controlo para se aferir se, de facto, as percepções se agudizavam com a experiência directa com a justiça ou se, ao contrário, esse contacto acabava por criar novas competências cognitivas sobre a realidade da justiça que acabariam por suavizar alguma desconfiança por inexperiência ou desconhecimento (quadro 1.2).\n\n45\n\nQuadro 1.2 – Impacto da experiência directa dos cidadãos com os tribunais nas percepções sobre o seu funcionamento (1 – muito de acordo e 5 – muito em desacordo)\n\nC1. Já esteve perante um tribunal Sim Não Total Significância na qualidade de parte estatística de um processo?\n\nC2. Diga-me se está muito de acordo, de acordo, em desacordo ou muito em desacordo com cada uma das seguintes frases sobre o funcionamento da justiça em Portugal:\n\nC2.a) Todos os cidadãos, independentemente do seu estatuto económico, social ou político, são tratados da mesma forma pelos tribunais 3,71 3,56 3,59 C2.b) As decisões dos tribunais são tomadas com independência em relação aos interesses económicos 3,37 3,31 3,33 C2.c) As decisões dos tribunais são tomadas com independência em relação aos interesses políticos 3,32 3,25 3,26 C2.d) As decisões dos tribunais são tão lentas que não vale a pena recorrer aos tribunais 2,40 2,48 2,47 C2.e) A justiça é eficaz na punição dos infractores 3,57 3,45 3,47 C2.f) A justiça é eficaz na compensação dos males causados às vítimas 3,48 3,55 3,54\n\nC2.g) O Estado dá um apoio satisfatório para o acesso à justiça 3,73 3,50 3,54 C2.h) De um modo geral, as decisões dos tribunais são respeitadas 3,02 2,87 2,90\n\nA diferença entre grupos é estatisticamente significativa\n\nA diferença entre grupos não é estatisticamente significativa\n\nLuís de Sousa\n\n46\n\nNa maioria das dimensões não existe uma diferença estatisticamente significativa entre os grupos. A média está sempre mais perto dos valores referentes ao grupo de cidadãos que não tiveram experiência prévia com os tribunais porque são um grupo maior. Porém, importa referir que nas duas dimensões de desempenho dos tribunais onde existe significância estatística (C2.g e C2.h, respectivamente) os valores indicam que os cidadãos que já tiveram contacto com a justiça têm uma percepção mais negativa no que concerne ao apoio do Estado para o acesso à justiça e à capacidade de os tribunais assegurarem o respeito pelas suas decisões. Não obstante parte do descontentamento com o desempenho do Estado de direito poder resultar de uma falha de comunicação e algum hermetismo por parte dos agentes e instituições judiciais e/ou de uma fraca cultura para a justiça por parte dos portugueses, o facto é que a experiência directa dos cidadãos com a face mais visível da justiça, que são os tribunais, não causa nestes uma boa impressão.\n\nImpotência da justiça face à corrupção\n\nO descontentamento com o funcionamento da justiça é agravado pela resposta ineficaz por esta prestada em matéria de combate à corrupção. A imagem popular é a de que a repressão da corrupção é impotente (porque atinge o infractor, mas raramente recupera o ganho ilícito gerado ou rectifica o dano público causado), lenta (porque os processos arrastam-se durante anos nos tribunais numa infindável teia burocrática e processual), onerosa para quem denuncia (porque deixa os denunciantes à sua sorte, sem uma protecção adequada), redutora (porque reduz o problema a uma falta de venalidade do infractor e descuida as estruturas de oportunidade conducentes a essa prática), selectiva (porque é severa com a pequena criminalidade, mas impotente em relação à criminalidade complexa que envolva políticos, altos cargos públicos, bancários e empresários), complacente (porque, sempre que de abusos da Fazenda ou do interesse público se trate, as penas são minoradas ou suspensas, já para não mencionar que em alguns casos os infractores são amnistiados), ineficaz (porque a maioria dos casos termina em arquivamento por falta de prova ou em prescrição) e inconsequente (porque o cumprimento de pena efectiva de prisão é uma raridade). Talvez se trate de uma avaliação demasiado negativa, mas o facto é que os dados estatísticos reforçam esta percepção de fraco desempenho do aparelho repressivo no combate à corrupção. As conclusões do pro Estado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\n47\n\njecto A Corrupção Participada em Portugal 2004-2008. Resultados Globais de Uma Pesquisa em Curso dão disso nota: A maioria dos processos instaurados entre 2004 e 2008 encontra-se arquivada (53,1%): 30,3% dos processos encontram-se em «investigação»; para 5,6% dos processos já existe acusação proferida; 6,9% dos processos foram encerrados por decisão judicial condenatória e em 1,7% dos processos foi proferida uma decisão absolutória. Do baixo volume de condenações transitadas em 1.ª instância, poucos são os condenados que cumprem pena de prisão efectiva. Importa referir que os crimes de corrupção são os que originam o maior número de arquivamentos por inexistência de indícios probatórios. Embora o volume dos arquivamentos esteja em proporção com o número de casos registados para cada um dos crimes, nos casos de corrupção esta tendência é mais acentuada. O elevado volume de arquivamentos deve-se, em grande medida, à forma de participação da ocorrência. A maioria dos processos instaurados relativos a este tipo de crime teve origem em participações anónimas, o que dificulta o acesso a provas testemunhais e, consequentemente, a indícios que comprovem a ocorrência do crime. Apenas um total de 14 processos de corrupção instaurados neste período resultou em condenações. Não obstante a obtenção de provas documentais sólidas ser mais fácil em relação ao crime de peculato,2 em parte devido ao facto de as participações serem geralmente apresentadas pelos próprios serviços onde decorre a infracção, e a sua condenação mais frequente, a grande maioria dos processos também se encontra arquivada. Os dados confirmam que nos processos onde não existam provas documentais, áudio, vídeo e fotográficas que possibilitem a confirmação da denúncia, mas onde existam apenas provas testemunhais, as quais se tornam pouco credíveis em tribunal, já que se trata da palavra de um interveniente contra a de outro, ou denúncias com relatos anónimos, que normalmente são acusatórios e não apresentam provas consistentes, são na maioria arquivados. A razão mais comummente proferida para a absolvição em 1.ª instância continua também a ser a «falta de prova quanto à apropriação de vantagem patrimonial e à sua ilicitude». Perante este cenário, é acertado o juízo de António Barreto ao afirmar que, «se houvesse justiça, a corrupção não seria um mal maior» em Por 2 O desvio ou apropriação indevida de dinheiros ou bens públicos por parte de um funcionário público no exercício de funções para benefício pessoal ou de terceiros.\n\nLuís de Sousa\n\n48\n\ntugal.3 Não surpreende, por isso, que a comprovada ineficácia da justiça no combate à corrupção esteja no centro do descontentamento dos cidadãos com a democracia. De acordo com os dados do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia», a corrupção (10%) constitui o terceiro maior defeito da democracia no país, só ultrapassado pela perda de confiança nos políticos e no governo (19%) e ineficácia da governação (11%), seguindo-se-lhe as desigualdades sociais (10%).\n\nConclusão\n\nO modo como os cidadãos encaram a justiça e o Estado de direito deve ser interpretado à luz de uma crescente insatisfação com os níveis de protecção dos direitos e garantias sociais dos cidadãos e com o desempenho da justiça, sobretudo no que concerne ao combate à corrupção. Não é, portanto, surpresa que em tempo de «vacas magras» os cidadãos demonstrem a sua preferência por uma justiça mais punitiva do que garantista (através da adopção de poderes especiais de investigação, da criminalização do enriquecimento ilícito, da suspensão imediata do mandato de um político acusado de corrupção e da possibilidade de revogar o mandato dos políticos por incompetência ou ilegalidades cometidas, etc.). A questão está em saber até que ponto a realização de uma sociedade solidária e justa no imaginário democrático dos portugueses não se transforma numa quimera de justicialismo, propícia à subida de formas dissimuladas de autoritarismo. Embora pareça prematuro falar de desconsolidação democrática, o crescente desencanto democrático não deve ser ignorado. Actualmente, apenas 56% dos portugueses consideram que a democracia é preferível a qualquer outra forma de governo. De acordo com os dados do World Values Survey de 1999, 81% dos portugueses consideravam a democracia um sistema muito bom ou bom para governar o país. Já relativamente aos que admitem a existência de um governo autoritário, em algumas circunstâncias aumentou de 9% no World Values Survey de 1999 para cerca de 15% em 2010. Como alerta Andreas Schedler, «democracies may survive despite low levels of popular support. Still, there is little doubt that high reserves of mass support provide a valuable cushion that help democracies to prevent the emergence of crises, as well as to overcome critical moments as they arise» (2007, 28).\n\n3 Público de 15-5-2005, 7.\n\nEstado de direito e qualidade da democracia\n\n49\n\nA maior ou menor capacidade do Estado de direito democrático para responder com eficácia e celeridade a estes dois desafios que se lhe colocam com maior acuidade no actual contexto de crise económica – nomeadamente a protecção de direitos sociais e o combate à corrupção – será determinante do grau de apoio e confiança que os cidadãos depositam no seu regime democrático. Como conclui Conceição Gomes: «Neste novo contexto social e político, a questão que se nos apresenta é a de saber qual o papel que o sistema judicial, globalmente considerado, pode desempenhar e as condições em que o deve fazer no desenvolvimento social e económico e no aprofundamento da democracia» (2011, 28).\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nAltman, D., e A.

De acordo com as teorias modernas da democracia, a inclusão dos indivíduos nos processos de decisão promove e ao mesmo tempo reflecte autonomia, competência, empoderamento e liberdade, contribuindo para informar os cidadãos sobre os problemas sócio- económicos e políticos e o funcionamento do processo governamental e animando o debate público. Os estudos sobre a participação política sugerem que estes aspectos contribuem para estreitar laços de pertença dentro da comunidade política e contribuem para a legitimação e estabilidade do poder político e a satisfação com o governo (Riker e Ordeshook 1968; Thompson 1970; Mansbridge 1983; Barber 1984; Wampler 2007). A literatura sobre a qualidade da democracia sugere também que existe uma correlação entre a participação política e o grau de satisfação individual ou a felicidade (Frey e Stutzer 2000; Blais e Gileneau 2007), mas os estudos efectuados até à data oferecem resultados contraditórios relativamente à direcção da causalidade entre estes factores. A forma mais convencional de participação política são as actividades eleitorais. Para muitos autores, este mecanismo primordial de transmissão das preferências políticas dos cidadãos aos seus representantes com o fim de influenciar a decisão pública (Verba e Nie 1972; Powell 2000)\n\n51\n\nconstitui até hoje o cerne da participação política e da democracia representativa:\n\nThe starting point of participation is to authorize public representatives or officials through free and fair electoral choice, and in a manner which produces a legislature that is representative of the different tendencies of public opinion [Beetham et al. 2008, 24].\n\nPara além desta forma mais convencional de participação política, existem outros canais de participação, através dos quais os cidadãos exercem influência sobre o processo político em períodos não eleitorais, nomeadamente referendos, petições, manifestações, protestos, greves, orçamentos participativos, instâncias de consulta e deliberação pública, debates nos meios de comunicação, associações, movimentos políticos e agências de lobbying, ocupações e boicotes.1\n\nOs estudos sobre a participação política sugerem que, do ponto de vista individual, cada uma destas formas de participação exige diferentes recursos, nomeadamente financeiros, de tempo e de educação, que não estão distribuídos de forma igual na sociedade, o que afecta a igualdade de oportunidades de participação (Brady et al. 1995; Beetham 2002; Landman 2008). Assim, de acordo com alguns autores, os homens de meia-idade, com salários elevados, educação académica e religiosos tendem a participar mais na vida política (Verba et al. 1978 e 1995). Para além destes factores sócio-económicos, alguns estudos têm observado que determinadas atitudes, como a confiança política, o interesse na política, o posicionamento nos extremos da escala esquerda-direita, a convicção de eficácia subjectiva (isto é, a capacidade de influenciar os resultados das políticas públicas) e noções de deveres de cidadania, influenciam a participação política (Rosenstone e Hansen 2003; Pattie et al. 2004; Dalton et al. 2004; Armingeon 2007; Dalton 2008). Por outro lado, numa perspectiva institucional, a oferta de diferentes canais de participação num determinado sistema político pode ser maior e mais frequente, ou mais escassa e esporádica, e isso também influencia a qualidade da participação, uma vez que interfere com a oportunidade de intervir nos processos de decisão pública (Ansell e Gingrich 2003; Cain et al. 2003; Dalton et al. 2004; Scarrow 1999; Bühlmann et al. 2008).\n\nMarco Lisi, Riccardo Marchi e Ana Maria Evans\n\n52\n\n1 Para estudos sobre estas modalidades de participação, cf. Barnes e Kaase 1979, Inglehart 1997, Parry et al. 1992, Verba et al. 1995, Uhlaner 1995, Van Deth 1997, Brady 1999 e Norris 2002.\n\nParticipação política e qualidade da democracia\n\nEstes aspectos são muito importantes na avaliação da qualidade das democracias. Nos termos em que é concebida a participação política nas teorias da democracia, os cidadãos devem ter igualdade de oportunidades na formulação e transmissão das suas preferências, com o intuito de influenciarem decisões colectivas que afectam a actividade social e individual. A participação não deve ser condicionada por factores como classe, status, poder, género, religião, outras características sociais e/ou individuais ou por disparidades no acesso à informação sobre problemas sociais e políticos e os mecanismos e processos de governança (Dahl 1971; Rueschemeyer 2004; Bühlmann et al. 2008). Numa perspectiva restritiva, o envolvimento dos cidadãos no processo político terá de ter impacto nos resultados da decisão colectiva para que se possa considerar esse acto como participação política (Pateman 1970; Beetham 1999; Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003; Landman 2008). Esta abordagem está associada a uma conceptualização substantiva da democracia, cuja premissa central é que as instituições democráticas asseguram o controlo popular das decisões públicas e a igualdade de direitos políticos (Knutsen 2010). Por outro lado, na história da filosofia política existe desde Aristóteles uma abordagem menos exigente ao tema da participação política, de acordo com a qual o envolvimento dos cidadãos nos mecanismos de decisão pública tem, por si só, valor intrínseco, independentemente do grau de influência e, como tal, do controlo popular efectivo sobre o conteúdo das políticas que resultam do processo de decisão. Neste sentido, a participação política está associada ao conceito de utilidade processual, isto é, a presunção de que as pessoas obtêm satisfação pelo seu envolvimento nos processos de decisão colectiva, mesmo que não consigam influenciar o conteúdo e resultados finais.2\n\nA análise que se segue sobre a participação política no caso português procura enquadrar estas considerações teóricas de acordo com a informação obtida pelos dados do inquérito efectuado em Portugal no âmbito da pesquisa do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia».\n\n53\n\n2 Cf. Morlino (2010) para a distinção entre os elementos processuais, estruturais e de conteúdo ou resultado na análise da qualidade das democracias.\n\nMarco Lisi, Riccardo Marchi e Ana Maria Evans\n\n54\n\nDados e metodologia: indicadores da participação do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» em Portugal\n\nO inquérito aplicado no âmbito do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» em Portugal incluiu dois blocos de perguntas relativas à avaliação da participação política em Portugal. O primeiro diz respeito ao conjunto de factores considerados prejudiciais à plena participação de todos os cidadãos.3 O objectivo deste bloco de perguntas é identificar os elementos que limitam o potencial de participação, procurando especificar quais as principais forças de bloqueio e constrangimentos da participação política em Portugal. O segundo bloco de variáveis incluído no inquérito do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» tem como objectivo medir a percepção da eficácia das várias formas de participação política. Neste sentido, perguntou-se aos cidadãos se consideram muito eficazes, eficazes, pouco eficazes ou nada eficazes os seguintes instrumentos de participação: votar nas eleições, assinar petições, participar em manifestações, participar em movimentos de cidadãos, contactar um político, colaborar com um partido político, participar em associações e alertar os órgãos de comunicação social. As respostas às duas baterias de perguntas são valoradas, respectivamente, nas escalas «muito de acordo-muito em desacordo» e «muito eficaz-nada eficaz». A apresentação dos dados é feita através de duas formas. Em primeiro lugar, apresentam-se as médias através de gráficos em colunas; em segundo lugar, reporta-se a distribuição da amostra através de quadros, agregando os dados nos dois graus positivos e dois negativos das respectivas escalas. Esta opção permite considerar melhor o grau intermédio – «nem uma coisa nem outra» –, que, para além de registar percentagens relevantes, apresenta uma interpretação algo problemática. As respostas «não sabe» e «não responde» são excluídas da análise.4\n\nAntes de proceder à análise dos resultados do inquérito convém sublinhar dois limites deste estudo. O primeiro baseia-se na ausência de indicadores relativos à participação efectiva dos cidadãos. Devido ao facto\n\n3 V. apêndice para uma descrição mais pormenorizada das variáveis utilizadas. 4 A percentagem de inquiridos que «não sabe» ou «não responde» relativamente à avaliação da participação oscila entre um valor mínimo de 5,7% e um máximo de 21,5%, registado no caso da pergunta sobre os cadernos eleitorais. Em geral, estas categorias de respostas apresentam valores mais baixos para a bateria de perguntas sobre a eficácia da participação, nunca ultrapassando os 10% de inquiridos.\n\nParticipação política e qualidade da democracia\n\n55\n\nde existirem vários inquéritos que fornecem informações específicas sobre o comportamento político dos cidadãos e o seu envolvimento na vida política, optou-se por não repetir as tradicionais perguntas sobre participação política no inquérito sobre a qualidade da democracia em Portugal.5\n\nEsta consideração também se aplica às dimensões de «participação latente», ou invisível, como, por exemplo, no caso do interesse pela política. O segundo limite refere-se à ausência de perguntas que procurem avaliar o significado da participação, sobretudo no que diz respeito à multidimensionalidade do conceito. Como sublinham vários autores (Verba et al. 1978; Barnes e Kaase 1979), a participação é um conceito complexo não apenas devido às múltiplas formas que pode subentender, mas também pelo valor axiológico que apresenta. Por outras palavras, apesar do valor positivo normalmente atribuído à participação, do ponto de vista normativo, este fenómeno está estritamente relacionado com o conceito de democracia. Infelizmente, o inquérito não inclui perguntas que permitam avaliar o significado que os cidadãos atribuem à participação. No entanto, os dados recolhidos pelo «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» indicam que a participação é considerada, globalmente, a dimensão menos importante para o funcionamento da democracia. De facto, apenas 71% dos inquiridos julgam muito importante ou absolutamente essencial que haja oportunidades políticas para as pessoas participarem na política: uma percentagem substancialmente mais reduzida quando comparada com as outras componentes básicas da qualidade da democracia.6 Este facto pode prender-se com o próprio processo de consolidação democrática, caracterizado por um processo de mobilização amplo e intenso – sobretudo durante os primeiros anos do regime democrático – em que as garantias e oportunidades de participação eram um dado adquirido por parte da maioria da população. Mas também o desinteresse na participação pode ter a ver com a desconfiança nas dimensões mais formais ou procedimentais das democracias representativas, sobretudo quando relacionadas com a eficácia que podem ter em termos de resultados substanciais. Estas questões serão aprofundadas nas próximas secções, no sentido de compreender melhor o desempenho da democracia portuguesa no que diz respeito à componente da participação, assim como a avaliação por parte dos cidadãos. Na secção seguinte iremos examinar a participa 5 V., entre outros, os inquéritos realizados no âmbito do European Social Survey e do projecto «Comportamento Eleitoral e Atitudes Políticas dos Portugueses», assim como os dados publicados em Freire et al.

A quarta secção centra-se na caracterização da avaliação da participação segundo os principais traços sócio-demográficos e atitudinais, procurando também evidenciar quais as principais determinantes relativas à eficácia dos instrumentos de participação. As conclusões resumem os principais resultados e lançam algumas pistas para a investigação futura.\n\nPercepção da participação por parte dos cidadãos\n\nFactores de bloqueio da participação\n\nA primeira bateria de perguntas (d1) aborda os factores que, na percepção dos inquiridos, dificultam a participação. Os dados agregados das respostas revelam, em primeiro lugar, uma forte desconfiança nos partidos e nos sindicatos (pergunta a) como instrumentos de participação dos cidadãos (figura 2.1). No caso dos sindicalizados, 63,1% dos inquiridos apontam o excessivo controlo que essas organizações exercem sobre as greves e as manifestações, retirando-lhes assim o carácter de mobilização espontânea (quadro 2.1). O mesmo problema de instrumentalização é apontado aos partidos políticos. Neste caso, 54,5% dos inquiridos apresentam uma visão crítica em relação ao papel das organizações partidárias (pergunta d), que são consideradas um obstáculo ao envolvimento dos cidadãos nos processos políticos. Esta percepção negativa dos inquiridos face a sindicatos e partidos é reforçada pela preferência pelo associativismo extrapartidário e extra-sindical (pergunta e) como instrumentos mais idóneos para participar na vida pública. A opinião positiva com que os inquiridos encaram as associações como instrumentos de participação (44,8%), contudo, é parcialmente anulada pela alta percentagem de inquiridos (37,5%, a mais alta de toda a bateria) que não atribuem nenhum papel relevante (nem positivo nem negativo) a este instrumento. No que diz respeito ao acesso à participação por parte de grupos sociais considerados vulneráveis (perguntas b e c), a amostra revela um certo consenso em denunciar as dificuldades ainda existentes para as minorias (54,1%) e para as mulheres (44,9%). Em geral, a participação é considerada prejudicial para a vida pessoal dos cidadãos, nomeadamente no que diz respeito à sua esfera profissional (pergunta g), embora a proporção dos que apresentam uma opinião neutral seja muito elevada (30,1%).\n\nMarco Lisi, Riccardo Marchi e Ana Maria Evans\n\n56\n\nParticipação política e qualidade da democracia\n\nEntre os factores que dificultam ou distorcem a participação, os inquiridos não apontam, de forma significativa, um dos problemas persistentes da democracia portuguesa: a organização dos cadernos eleitorais (pergunta f). Apesar do efeito na computação da participação eleitoral, esse factor reveste ainda um carácter demasiado técnico para ser avaliado na sua justa dimensão pelos inquiridos, como demonstra a alta percentagem de inquiridos que «não sabe[m]» exprimir uma avaliação (20,5%), em comparação com a distribuição pouco discriminatória das respostas da amostra: 40,7% reconhecem o problema, 25,8% não o reconhecem e 33,6% dos inquiridos negam que este factor tenha algum impacto, seja ele positivo ou negativo. Apesar do carácter bastante discriminatório das respostas fornecidas, deve ser assinalada a percentagem relevante de inquiridos (entre 18% e 37,5%) que indicaram como os diferentes factores apresentados pelas perguntas não foram por eles percepcionados como negativos ou positivos para a qualidade da participação em Portugal. Esse dado denota, possivelmente, uma fraca capacidade de análise acerca da temática da participação por parte de quase um quarto da população portuguesa.\n\n57\n\nFigura 2.1 – Limites e constrangimentos da participação\n\nFonte: «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» (ICS-UL).

Da análise dos dados resulta que para a maioria absoluta dos portugueses (61,9%), a participação eleitoral (pergunta a) continua a ser a forma mais eficaz de intervenção na vida pública (quadro 2.1 e figura 2.2). Segue-se a utilização dos meios de comunicação social (pergunta h), percepcionados por 51,4% da amostra como o segundo meio mais eficaz para intervir ou alertar acerca de questões de interesse público. Os restantes instrumentos de intervenção recebem uma apreciação positiva, mas sem se destacarem particularmente entre os que os consideram eficazes e os que não os valorizam tanto. Em todos estes casos, de facto, a amostra divide-se de forma quase equitativa entre as duas metades da escala. Em particular, são julgados positivamente: assinar petições (pergunta b) e participar em manifestações (pergunta c), em movimentos de cidadãos (pergunta d) ou em associações (pergunta g).\n\nMarco Lisi, Riccardo Marchi e Ana Maria Evans\n\n58\n\nFonte: «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» (ICS-UL).

Nesse caso, contactar um político (pergunta e) ou um partido (pergunta f) são as únicas duas opções julgadas não eficazes pela maioria relativa dos inquiridos, 43,2% e 38,8%, respectivamente. Em geral, podemos, portanto, concluir que existe uma preferência dos cidadãos portugueses para avaliar de forma mais positiva a estratégia de\n\n59\n\nQuadro 2.1 – Avaliação da participação pelos cidadãos (percentagem)\n\nMuito de acordo/ Nem uma coisa Muito em desacordo/ acordo nem outra desacordo\n\na) Em Portugal, as greves e manifestações estão demasiado controladas pelos sindicatos ou pelos partidos 63,1 18,0 18,9 b) Em Portugal existem discriminações que dificultam a participação das mulheres na vida política 44,9 25,4 29,7 c) Em Portugal existem discriminações que dificultam a participação das minorias na vida política 54,1 25,9 19,9 d) Em Portugal, a maneira como os partidos funcionam limita a participação dos cidadãos 54,5 27,4 18,1 e) Em Portugal defendemos melhor os nossos interesses participando em associações do que em partidos 44,8 37,5 17,7 f) Em Portugal, a organização dos cadernos eleitorais dificulta a participação dos cidadãos no acto eleitoral 40,7 33,6 25,8 g) Em Portugal, participar publicamente em organizações políticas pode prejudicar a realização profissional 44,3 30,1 25,6\n\nMuito eficaz Nem uma coisa Pouco ou nada ou eficaz nem outra eficaz\n\na) Votar nas eleições 61,9 12,0 26,1 b) Assinar petições 39,4 22,0 38,6 c) Participar em manifestações 39,0 23,7 37,4 d) Participar em movimentos de cidadãos 43,6 21,0 35,4 e) Pôr-se em contacto com um político 32,8 23,9 43,2 f) Colaborar com um partido político 37,5 23,7 38,8 g) Participar em associações 39,5 25,6 34,9 h) Alertar os órgãos de comunicação social 51,4 19,7 28,9\n\nFonte: «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» (ICS-UL).\n\nexit (baseada no voto ou não voto) do que os recursos associados à voice, que têm como objectivo intervir na esfera política através de intermediários para atingir objectivos específicos (Teorell et al. 2007). Cruzando os dados das perguntas a e d da bateria d1 e os das perguntas a, e e f da bateria d2, resulta uma certa contradição entre a desconfiança em relação aos partidos, por um lado, e a confiança na participação eleitoral como instrumento para incidir na vida pública, por outro. Considerando o carácter «bloqueado» do sistema político português, em que o acesso ao governo é de facto prerrogativa quase exclusiva dos dois partidos centrais, parece que a possibilidade de controlar a alternância através do voto é considerada o instrumento mais eficaz de participação dos cidadãos, independentemente das consequências reais que esta alternância pode ter na política nacional. Qual é a relação que existe entre as várias dimensões incluídas no inquérito? Analisando os dados a nível individual, estudos anteriores evidenciaram a correlação positiva existente entre várias formas de participação política, convencional e não convencional (Teorell et al. 2007). Aqui ocupar-nos-emos sobretudo da associação entre as várias dimensões a nível das atitudes dos portugueses. No que diz respeito aos factores considerados prejudiciais para a participação por parte dos cidadãos, os valores de correlação são, em geral, moderados (quadro 2.2). A primeira observação interessante é que existe uma relação positiva entre as várias dimensões. Isto significa que estas atitudes estão interligadas e quem avalia negativamente o desempenho da democracia em termos de oportunidades de participação tende a ter uma visão globalmente pessimista ou céptica acerca desta vertente. Por outras palavras, não parece existir nenhum trade-off entre as dimensões de participação. Passando a observar a intensidade da relação, há, como era previsível, uma associação estrita entre a percepção de que existem discriminações para as mulheres e para as minorias (coeficiente tau-b 0,52). Por outro lado, os indivíduos que consideram existir discriminação na participação de minorias são também mais propensos a percepcionar os partidos como um factor de bloqueio. Passando à análise da correlação entre a eficácia das várias modalidades de participação, é possível notar uma forte interligação entre as várias componentes incluídas no inquérito (quadro 2.3). Aqui também as várias dimensões analisadas estão todas positivamente interligadas, facto que reflecte homogeneidade na avaliação das diferentes formas de participação. Este resultado confirma os dados obtidos a partir do comportamento dos cidadãos, segundo os quais os que participam mais através de um tipo de participação são mais propensos também a recorrer a outras mo Marco Lisi, Riccardo Marchi e Ana Maria Evans\n\n60\n\nParticipação política e qualidade da democracia\n\ndalidades de mobilização (Teorell et al. 2007).

Em geral, os dados sugerem a existência de duas fontes principais de cepticismo nas modalidades de participação: a primeira, mais acentuada, baseia-se na participação mais convencional, mediada através das organizações partidárias, enquanto a outra reside na irrelevância atribuída à participação inorgânica.7 No entanto, ocorre considerar que os coeficientes de correlação são médios ou fortes para todas as dimensões consideradas, ultrapassando em muitos casos uma correlação superior a 0,6. Isto significa que quem tende a olhar de forma mais positiva a própria intervenção na esfera política irá fazê-lo de forma geral, sem considerar de forma significativamente diferente as várias modalidades de participação.\n\nPreditores da avaliação da participação\n\nEstudos anteriores sobre a participação em Portugal evidenciaram que, apesar de as atitudes políticas terem o impacto mais significativo, existem importantes diferenças estruturais entre os vários grupos sociais (Cabral 2000; Viegas e Faria 2004 e 2007).8 Em primeiro lugar, os homens, tradicionalmente, apresentam uma maior propensão para a participação na vida pública, embora as diferenças não sejam significativas sobretudo no período mais recente (Baum e Espírito-Santo 2007, 149).9 Em segundo lugar, há uma diferença importante no que diz respeito à idade. Aqui nota-se uma tendência para uma maior participação com o aumentar da idade (Freire 2001; Freire e Magalhães 2002).10 Em terceiro lugar, a prática religiosa favorece um maior envolvimento dos indivíduos na vida política, reforçando a integração social e as ligações dos cidadãos com a comunidade. Finalmente, o efeito do habitat (rural vs. urbano) parece ser\n\n7 Uma análise factorial exploratória sugere a existência de apenas um factor relevante, confirmando a forte correlação que existe entre as diferentes dimensões consideradas na análise. No entanto, quando a análise por componentes principais é constrangida a dois factores, as soluções indicam a existência de duas formas de desconfiança, uma em relação às organizações partidárias e outra que inclui as restantes formas de participação, respectivamente. 8 A maioria dos estudos aqui referidos baseia-se na análise da participação convencional, nomeadamente da participação eleitoral ou cívica. 9 Em particular, estes autores não encontraram diferenças relevantes em termos de desigualdades de género relativamente à participação eleitoral, enquanto as diferenças desapareceram ao longo do tempo no que diz respeito à participação convencional e não convencional. 10 Magalhães (2008) evidencia também um efeito curvilinear da idade sobre a participação eleitoral.\n\nParticipação política e qualidade da democracia\n\ncontroverso (Freire 2001, 20; Viegas e Faria 2004), embora estudos recentes baseados em dados individuais evidenciem um impacto não significativo no que diz respeito às diferentes formas de participação (Viegas e Faria 2007; Viegas et al. 2010a). Até que ponto os diferentes grupos apresentam divergências no que diz respeito à percepção dos bloqueios à participação? Vista a associação positiva evidenciada anteriormente na percepção dos vários constrangimentos, utilizamos aqui um índice da maior ou menor percepção das desigualdades na participação a partir do bloco de perguntas d1 (v. apêndice). A análise indica que não existem diferenças na percepção da participação em termos de grupos sócio-demográficos (quadro 2.4). Isto significa que a percepção positiva ou negativa das modalidades de participação em Portugal não está relacionada com as características sociológicas dos indivíduos, sendo os valores do coeficiente de correlação tau-b sempre inferiores a 0,1.11\n\nAté que ponto esta percepção depende das atitudes dos indivíduos? Consideramos três dimensões atitudinais que vários estudos apontam estar relacionadas com a participação dos indivíduos (Freire e Magalhães 2002; Viegas e Faria 2007): a ideologia, a identidade partidária e a satisfação com a democracia. Também neste caso os resultados são, em geral, negativos. Apesar de os coeficientes serem estatisticamente significativos, a intensidade da correlação é muito fraca. Isto significa que a avaliação dos obstáculos à participação não está relacionada com as orientações ideológicas ou partidárias nem com a avaliação do desempenho da democracia. No caso da ideologia, não há nenhuma diferença entre um cidadão que se posiciona à esquerda ou à direita relativamente à percepção dos constrangimentos para a participação.12 Mas, se considerarmos não o posicionamento no espectro ideológico, mas a capacidade de o indivíduo se posicionar neste eixo, a associação é mais forte e significativa.13\n\nIsto significa que um indivíduo que não é capaz de se posicionar no espectro esquerda-direita é mais propenso a identificar constrangimentos\n\n63\n\n11 Os resultados não se alteram quando consideramos a associação entre cada uma das componentes da participação e os correlatos sócio-demográficos. 12 Para a maioria das variáveis relativas à percepção da participação, a correlação indica que os cidadãos com orientações ideológicas de direita tendem a discordar mais (relativamente aos indivíduos mais de esquerda) do facto de existirem discriminações que dificultam a participação dos indivíduos. De qualquer forma, os coeficientes são sempre muito fracos. 13 A variável esquerda-direita foi recodificada numa variável dicotómica entre os que se identificam no espectro ideológico e os que não sabem ou não respondem. Este último grupo corresponde a 33,5% dos entrevistados.\n\nà participação. O mesmo resultado é obtido quando consideramos a posição mais ou menos central dos cidadãos na mesma escala, ou seja, a distância ideológica em relação ao centro do eixo esquerda-direita. Os indivíduos que se colocam nas posições mais extremas são os que consideram existirem maiores constrangimentos à participação. Também no que diz respeito à identidade partidária a associação com este bloco de variáveis é relativamente fraca, com uma correlação apenas superior a 0,1. Finalmente, os que estão mais satisfeitos com o funcionamento da democracia tendem a concordar com a existência de desigualdades e constrangimentos para a participação. As conclusões anteriores são substancialmente confirmadas também ao analisar o outro bloco de perguntas, relativo à eficácia das várias modalidades de participação. Também neste caso não há correlações significativas com as variáveis sócio-demográficas nem com a posição no espectro esquerda-direita.14 As duas variáveis que apresentam uma relação mais forte com a eficácia das várias modalidades de participação\n\nMarco Lisi, Riccardo Marchi e Ana Maria Evans\n\n64\n\nQuadro 2.4 – Correlação entre variáveis sócio-demográficas e atitudinais e índices da avaliação da participação\n\nÍndice constrangimentos Índice eficácia Eficácia à participação da participação do acto eleitoral\n\nGénero –0,002 –0,006 –0,04 Idade 0,005 –0,002 0,02 Educação 0,04 0,015 0,03 Frequência religiosa –0,02 0,06 0,01 Habitat –0,03 0,03 –0,07** Ideologia 0,08** –0,18** –0,14** Centrismo 0,08** 0,06* 0,05 Identidade partidária 0,13** –0,24** –0,20** Exposição aos media –0,04 0,11** 0,10** Satisfação com a democracia 0,08** 0,06** 0,16**\n\n*p < 0,05; **p < 0,01.

No entanto, no que diz respeito à avaliação da eficácia, os indivíduos com orientações ideológicas de direita, tendencialmente, consideram mais eficazes os instrumentos de participação, excepto no caso da participação em movimentos de cidadãos ou em manifestações em que a relação apresenta o sentido contrário. Mas, em geral, os valores dos coeficientes raramente alcançam significância estatística.\n\nParticipação política e qualidade da democracia\n\nsão a ideologia e a identidade partidária. Em primeiro lugar, os resultados indicam que os indivíduos que têm dificuldade em utilizar o conceito abstracto de esquerda e direita, geralmente, consideram ineficaz participar na vida política, quer através dos actores da representação política, quer através das formas de mobilização cívica (manifestações, movimentos de cidadãos, intervenção através dos meios de comunicação). Em segundo lugar, os indivíduos que não se identificam com nenhum partido consideram irrelevante tentar influenciar as decisões políticas através das várias formas de participação. Finalmente, ocorre sublinhar que não há diferenças significativas na avaliação que é feita dos vários instrumentos de participação: independentemente de serem consideradas formas de participação convencional ou não convencional, a percepção dos apartidários é sempre negativa no que diz respeito à eficácia da participação. Analisando separadamente a avaliação da eficácia da participação eleitoral, duas considerações merecem ser destacadas. Em primeiro lugar, as correlações permanecem relativamente fracas e apresentam, em geral, a mesma direcção que as outras componentes da participação. Em segundo lugar, há uma associação muito mais forte em relação à satisfação com a democracia. Os indivíduos que avaliam de forma mais positiva o funcionamento do sistema político atribuem também uma maior eficácia à participação eleitoral. Para analisar as determinantes da avaliação da participação na democracia portuguesa procedeu-se a uma análise multivariada. O modelo inclui como variáveis independentes as principais características sócio-demográficas, ou seja, género, idade, educação, religião, habitat e situação profissional. Dada a fraca associação entre as características estruturais dos indivíduos e as atitudes perante a participação, o modelo base inclui também as principais predisposições políticas, nomeadamente a ideologia e a proximidade partidária. Este modelo base foi testado considerando três variáveis dependentes distintas. A primeira baseia-se no índice construído a partir das avaliações dos constrangimentos à participação, enquanto a segunda considera as dimensões relativas à eficácia das diferentes formas de participação. Uma categoria separada é constituída pela eficácia do voto, que, como vimos anteriormente, é a dimensão mais consensual e a que se relaciona menos com as outras categorias. Analisando, em primeiro lugar, a avaliação em relação aos constrangimentos da participação, o primeiro elemento a considerar é o fraco impacto das variáveis estruturais. A única variável sócio-demográfica que apresenta um efeito significativo é a educação (quadro 2.5). Os indivíduos\n\n65\n\ncom maior nível de educação percepcionam maiores desigualdades na participação, enquanto os menos instruídos são mais propensos a ter uma opinião positiva. No entanto, são as predisposições políticas as variáveis que parecem explicar melhor a variação na avaliação da participação. São sobretudo os que não se posicionam no eixo esquerda-direita que julgam existirem mais desigualdades. A associação entre a avaliação da participação e a identidade partidária vai no mesmo sentido. Isto significa que, em geral, são os indivíduos menos integrados politicamente e que apresentam uma socialização política mais fraca que avaliam negativamente a democracia portuguesa na possibilidade de oferecer oportunidades de participação a todos os grupos sociais. O modelo testado consegue explicar apenas uma parte reduzida da percepção dos cidadãos, sendo a variância explicada correspondente apenas a 5%. Considerando o impacto que as atitudes políticas exercem sobre a participação, é possível especificar ulteriormente o modelo através da inclusão de outras variáveis independentes. Neste sentido, foi também testado o impacto da exposição aos meios de comunicação e dos índices da eficácia, interna e externa.15 Apesar desta especificação, a melhoria do modelo é praticamente nula e não se verificam alterações aos resultados anteriores. Por outras palavras, a percepção do desempenho da participação não depende tanto do sentido de eficácia, mas sobretudo da integração política dos cidadãos. Passando agora a analisar a eficácia da participação, os resultados confirmam que este tipo de avaliação não está relacionado com os diferentes grupos sociais. Por outro lado, as variáveis atitudinais apresentam um impacto estatisticamente significativo sobre a percepção da eficácia da participação. O efeito mais forte é relativo à identidade partidária. Os cidadãos que não se sentem próximos de nenhum partido têm uma percepção negativa em relação à eficácia da participação. O mesmo acontece com os indivíduos que não conseguem ou recusam posicionar-se na escala esquerda-direita. Ao contrário do que se verifica no caso dos constrangimentos à participação, a inclusão de outras variáveis atitudinais tem um impacto es Marco Lisi, Riccardo Marchi e Ana Maria Evans\n\n66\n\n15 O índice de exposição aos meios de comunicação é construído a partir da frequência com que os indivíduos lêem jornais, vêem ou ouvem notícias sobre a situação política. O índice de eficácia interna considera duas perguntas: «pessoas como eu não têm qualquer influência no processo político» e «a política é um assunto demasiado complexo para uma pessoa como eu», enquanto a eficácia externa é medida através das perguntas «os políticos não se interessam pelo que pessoas como eu pensam» e «os políticos preocupam-se apenas com os seus próprios interesses».\n\nParticipação política e qualidade da democracia\n\n67\n\ntatisticamente significativo, embora a melhoria do modelo seja muito reduzida. Para além da falta de integração política, a desconfiança em relação aos políticos faz com que os indivíduos tenham uma percepção negativa da eficácia da participação. Para além da eficácia externa, o índice de exposição aos meios de comunicação alcança significância estatística, enquanto a eficácia interna não parece ter nenhum impacto relevante. Finalmente, a reduzida variância explicada poderá estar relacionada com a falta de especificação do modelo, sobretudo no que diz respeito às variáveis relativas à conjuntura política. De facto, no caso da participação política, estas variáveis têm demonstrado um peso cada vez maior ao longo do tempo (Viegas e Faria 2007, 100). A análise da percepção da eficácia da participação não parece confirmar estes resultados,16 embora não estejam disponíveis indicadores mais adequados, como, por exemplo, a avaliação da conjuntura económica ou o desempenho do governo. Na análise multivariada consideramos a eficácia no acto eleitoral como uma componente separada, visto o carácter mais atípico – e mais consensual – desta forma de participação. De facto, os resultados mostram um impacto mais consistente das variáveis sócio-demográficas, no 16 Introduzindo no modelo de regressão a variável «satisfação com a democracia» a variância explicada aumenta ligeiramente (r2 = 0,10), mas sem alcançar resultados estatisticamente significativos.\n\nQuadro 2.5 – Avaliação da participação: análise multivariada (OLS)\n\nConstrangimentos à participação Eficácia da participação Eficácia do voto\n\nModelo 1 Modelo 2 Modelo 1 Modelo 2 Modelo 1 Modelo 2\n\nGénero 0,19 (0,35) 0,001 (0,37) -0,16 (0,48) 0,18 (0,46) 0,003 (0,07) 0,04 (0,08) Idade 0,02 (0,01) 0,02 (0,01) 0,00 (0,02) -0,004 (0,02) 0,003 (0,00) 0,003 (0,00) Educação 0,35 (0,13) *** 0,34 (0,14) ** 0,20 (0,17) -0,05 (0,18) 0,06 (0,03) ** 0,03 (0,03) Prática religiosa –0,06 (0,15) –0,09 (0,15) 0,26 (0,19) 0,32 (0,19) * –0,03 (0,03) –0,02 (0,03) Profissão 0,77 (0,49) 0,74 (0,50) –0,40 (0,61) –0,57 (0,61) –0,01 (0,10) –0,03 (0,10) Habitat –0,23 (0,16) –0,22 (0,16) 0,11 (0,20) 0,14 (0,20) –0,08 (0,03) ** –0,08 (0,03) ** Ideologia 1,09 (0,44) ** 1,26 (0,46) *** –1,56 (0,55) ** –1,60 (0,56) *** –0,15 (0,09) * –0,15 (0,09) * Proximidade partidária 1,01 (0,40) ** 0,89 (0,42) ** –2,87 (0,51) ** –2,45 (0,54) *** –0,40 (0,08) *** –0,34 (0,08) *** Exposição aos media – –0,08 (0,06) – 0,18 (0,08) ** – 0,01 (0,01) Eficácia interna – 0,09 (0,12) – 0,16 (0,16) – 0,02 (0,03) Eficácia externa – 0,13 (0,13) – 0,32 (0,17)* – 0,07 (0,03) **\n\nConstante 15,6 (1,08) *** 12,8 (1,58) *** 28,3 (1,36) *** 22,8 (2,01) *** 4,10 (0,27) *** 3,59 (0,33) *** R2 0,05 0,06 0,09 0,11 0,06 0,07 (N) (667) (646) (848) (776) (886) (848)\n\nNotas: ***p < 0,01; **p < 0,05; *p < 0,1.

Os mais educados são mais propensos a julgar o voto como uma forma eficaz de participação, assim como os que residem nas zonas mais rurais. Por outro lado, a ideologia tem um efeito mais reduzido e confirma-se o impacto crucial da proximidade partidária sobre esta componente. Em ambos os casos, os indivíduos com uma menor socialização política, ou seja, com maiores dificuldades em se orientarem na esfera política, são os que consideram o voto uma forma pouco eficaz de intervir e influenciar as decisões políticas. Finalmente, a avaliação da participação eleitoral também se relaciona de forma significativa com a eficácia externa, enquanto a mobilização cognitiva não parece ter efeitos significativos.\n\nConsiderações finais\n\nVários estudos indicam que as práticas de participação e de mobilização cívica em Portugal apresentam níveis relativamente reduzidos quando comparados com outras democracias europeias (Cabral 2000; Viegas et al. 2010a e 2010b). Em termos de participação convencional, os valores da abstenção têm vindo a aumentar nas últimas décadas, alcançando um máximo de 53,5% nas eleições presidenciais de 2011. Porém, as taxas de participação nos partidos políticos são extremamente baixas, registando-se um declínio sobretudo a partir dos anos 90 (Van Biezen et al. 2011). Por outro lado, o declínio das formas de participação convencional não tem sido acompanhado por um aumento das novas formas de participação, como, por exemplo, no caso da participação em movimentos sociais ou através de formas de automobilização. Dados de inquérito confirmam o reduzido envolvimento dos cidadãos portugueses nas diversas formas de participação (Viegas et al. 2010a). A nível institucional, a percentagem de inquiridos que apresentam alguma forma de participação oscila entre 2% e 5%, uma percentagem substancialmente inferior a outros países da Europa ocidental. Ainda maior é a diferença entre Portugal e outras democracias se considerarmos as novas formas de participação política e as acções de protesto.17\n\nEstas considerações sugerem que um dos elementos críticos do funcionamento da democracia portuguesa se relaciona com a componente\n\n17 Por exemplo, apenas 3% e 4% dos inquiridos declaram ter participado numa manifestação ou numa greve, respectivamente. Em Espanha, os valores são de 15% e 8%, respectivamente (dados relativos a 2001-2002, Viegas et al. 2010a, 27).\n\nParticipação política e qualidade da democracia\n\n69\n\nparticipativa. Até que ponto a crise de participação se reflecte na percepção dos cidadãos? Este estudo é um primeiro passo para a compreensão da avaliação das formas de participação e do envolvimento dos portugueses na vida política. Os dados recolhidos pelo «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» sugerem que há uma visão muito negativa no que diz respeito às oportunidades da participação. Depois de quatro décadas de democracia, cerca da metade dos indivíduos inquiridos pensa que ainda existem constrangimentos para a participação na vida política para as mulheres ou para as minorias. Contudo, os tradicionais actores responsáveis pela mobilização são considerados um obstáculo para o envolvimento na esfera política. Há, portanto, um profundo cepticismo nas oportunidades de participação que a democracia oferece aos cidadãos. Relativamente às diferentes modalidades de mobilização, os resultados deste estudo sugerem que a participação eleitoral é considerada, globalmente, de forma mais positiva quando comparada com outros instrumentos de intervenção. Apesar dos níveis elevados de abstenção registados nas últimas duas décadas, a participação convencional através das eleições representa ainda o meio que mais confiança inspira nos cidadãos. No entanto, se considerarmos o caso português numa perspectiva comparada, também no que diz respeito à eficácia do voto a avaliação dos cidadãos não resulta particularmente positiva. De facto, quando se pergunta se o voto faz a diferença, a discrepância entre avaliações positivas e negativas é de apenas 4 pontos percentuais, um dos valores mais baixos entre os países analisados (Caul Kittilson e Anderson 2011).18\n\nPor outro lado, os baixos níveis de participação não convencional podem estar relacionados com a percepção de que as organizações políticas – nomeadamente os partidos – tendem a instrumentalizar e influenciar as dinâmicas de mobilização, aumentando a desconfiança em relação à participação «inorgânica». Contudo, esta análise deve ser aprofundada e complementada através da relação que existe entre participação e outras dimensões da qualidade da democracia, sobretudo no que diz respeito à igualdade e à responsividade do sistema político. Estudos anteriores indicaram que a disponibilidade de recursos de mobilização é um elemento relativamente pouco importante para explicar a participação eleitoral (Freire e Magalhães 2002; Magalhães 2008). No entanto, alguns grupos sociais diferenciam-se claramente em termos\n\n18 O estudo baseia-se nos dados do Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). Os dados de Portugal referem-se às eleições legislativas de 2005.\n\nMarco Lisi, Riccardo Marchi e Ana Maria Evans\n\n70\n\nde padrões de participação, sobretudo no sentido de uma menor adesão às novas formas de participação (Viegas et al. 2010a, 39). É o caso dos mais novos, dos indivíduos com menor nível de educação e que pertencem às classes sociais mais baixas. Apesar de o seu efeito ser cada vez mais reduzido nas sociedades europeias, as determinantes sociais ajudam a explicar os diferentes padrões de envolvimento na política. No caso português, no entanto, estas divergências apagam-se quase por completo quando consideramos a percepção dos cidadãos em relação à participação. Isto significa que a avaliação, maioritariamente negativa, das oportunidades de participação é bastante difusa e não caracteriza apenas os eleitores mais jovens ou mais educados. Neste sentido, a reduzida importância atribuída ao envolvimento activo na esfera política emerge também a nível comparado quando observamos a percentagem de indivíduos que consideram a maior intervenção dos cidadãos nas decisões a principal prioridade do país. Segundo os dados do European Values Study (2008), apenas 20% dos portugueses partilham esta opinião, valor que se situa abaixo da média europeia (25%). Estes dados sugerem, portanto, uma reduzida confiança na eficácia política da participação, sobretudo quando comparamos Portugal com as democracias da Europa do Sul19\n\nou várias democracias da Europa de Leste. As conclusões preliminares deste estudo indicam que as diferenças na percepção dos constrangimentos e da eficácia da participação se baseiam sobretudo nas atitudes políticas dos indivíduos. Os indivíduos que não se identificam em nenhum partido são mais propensos a atribuir uma menor eficácia aos processos de participação e a considerar que existem fortes desigualdades nas oportunidades de intervir no sistema político. Analogamente, os que não se reconhecem no eixo ideológico têm também uma avaliação profundamente negativa no que diz respeito à componente participativa da democracia. Para além do impacto da identidade partidária e da ideologia, a confiança nos actores políticos e na própria capacidade de intervir na esfera política é um factor determinante no que diz respeito à avaliação da participação. Neste sentido, este trabalho confirma os principais resultados evidenciados por estudos anteriores (Viegas et al. 2010a). Estas conclusões são, de qualquer forma, pouco satisfatórias. Por um lado, a capacidade explicativa dos modelos é bastante reduzida. Por\n\n19 Por exemplo, na Grécia a prioridade de uma maior participação é partilhada por 35% dos inquiridos, em Itália esta percentagem é de 30% e em Espanha corresponde a 26% (dados de 2008).\n\nParticipação política e qualidade da democracia\n\n71\n\noutro, é plausível que os indivíduos com uma socialização política limitada e mais afastados do processo político tendam a avaliar de forma negativa a participação. Neste sentido, parece-nos útil percorrer duas linhas de investigação. Em primeiro lugar, permanece um ponto de interrogação sobre os efeitos que o contexto político e económico pode ter tido sobre a avaliação da participação. Dadas as limitações do inquérito, não é possível saber até que ponto o cepticismo em relação à participação se relaciona com o agravamento da crise económica e a degradação da imagem dos partidos junto da opinião pública. Por outro, seria necessário também analisar mais em pormenor o processo de socialização política, sobretudo em termos das diferenças geracionais. Finalmente, estes resultados devem também ser interpretados com cautela devido ao facto de não existirem dados longitudinais ou comparados que nos permitam contextualizar melhor a avaliação da participação por parte dos cidadãos. Embora não seja possível falar de um «retrocesso» da democracia portuguesa, esta dimensão constitui, sem dúvida, uma das áreas que mais preocupações suscitam em termos do funcionamento de uma «democracia de qualidade», sobretudo quando consideramos os reduzidos níveis de participação política e a avaliação negativa acerca das oportunidades de participação. As implicações deste fenómeno e as consequências relativamente às políticas implementadas constituem outras questões fundamentais a examinar em futuras investigações.\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nAnsell, C., e J.

Sendo que os partidos políticos são o principal canal de representação política dos cidadãos num sistema político democrático, é de prever que, quanto mais os cidadãos se sintam representados pelos partidos existentes, mais positiva tenderá a ser também a sua avaliação do funcionamento da democracia em que vivem. Tendo por base dados recolhidos no âmbito do primeiro inquérito de opinião realizado pelo projecto «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia», este capítulo propõe-se discutir um conjunto de questões centrais sobre a relação dos portugueses com o seu sistema representativo. Em que medida se sentem os portugueses representados pelos partidos políticos? Encontrarão eles nos partidos o seu canal privilegiado de expressão política ou, antes pelo contrário, identificar-se-ão, cada vez mais, com outros canais alternativos de expressão política, actuando dentro e fora do aparelho de Estado? Verificar-se-á em Portugal a relação compensatória que alguma literatura tem identificado entre representação subjectiva (ou o «sentir-se representado» por um partido) e participação política, o que implicaria que quem não sinta que as suas posições estão bem representadas no sistema político-partidário se volte para a\n\n* As autoras figuram em ordem alfabética, sendo igual a sua contribuição para o presente capítulo.\n\nparticipação extrapartidária enquanto forma de aumentar a sua eficácia política (Ikeada et al. 2008, 85)? Ou estaremos a assistir a uma simples retirada daqueles cidadãos que, descontentes com a representação partidária, também não se identificam com a presença que lhes é dada por qualquer outro agente e/ou instituição com potenciais funções representativas e, assim sendo, acabam por renunciar simplesmente a ter qualquer «voz» política, seja ela dada pela representação ou pela acção directa? Eis, pois, o conjunto de questões que enquadram a análise conduzida ao longo deste capítulo.\n\nEnquadramento\n\nDemocracia representativa em crise?\n\nHá já várias décadas que a democracia representativa vive sob o signo da crise. Da subida da abstenção eleitoral ao declínio da filiação, identificação e mobilização partidárias, da maior volatilidade dos eleitores e resultados eleitorais aos elevados níveis de cepticismo e desconfiança face às elites políticas, tudo são sintomas comummente apontados como relevando de uma doença maior e de difícil cura: a degenerescência do modelo representativo que, historicamente, serviu de base à teoria e à prática da democracia moderna (v., entre muitos outros, Pitkin 2003 e Dalton 2004). A democracia representativa é um sistema político singular e particularmente exigente. Na base do princípio «um cidadão – um voto», confere voz aos cidadãos, enquanto indivíduos, mas fá-lo no intuito de lhes devolver uma voz colectiva, que é também uma voz necessariamente representada, em que se possam rever. Toda e qualquer tentativa de representação política democrática é, de resto, já, pelo menos em parte, uma crise de representação, na medida em que em democracia nunca há – nem deve haver – lugar a uma perfeita coincidência entre representantes e representados. Do reconhecimento da diferença entre ambos depende a capacidade crítica dos representados em relação à imagem colectiva que lhes é devolvida pelos seus representantes, em reflexo, bem assim como a continuidade da relação de influência, controlo e poder em que assenta todo o jogo político democrático. Embora todo o «povo» seja uma construção política e tenha, portanto, de ser representado para que exista enquanto tal, numa democracia ele nunca pode ser sujeito de uma representação que assuma um carácter definitivo e incontroverso (Frank 2010). Pelo contrário, e apesar da tendência crescente para a concentração\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n80\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\nde poder no executivo, o governo representativo compõe-se de diversas instituições representativas (e. g., parlamento, governo, Presidência da República e mesmo tribunais, administrando justiça «em nome do povo»), que foram criadas para limitar, quando não mesmo para desafiar, o monopólio do governo sobre a representação do «povo» e sobre a definição da sua vontade colectiva. Toda a representação democrática implica, assim, um questionamento de que a vontade do «povo» seja, afinal, uma tensão permanente entre as partes e o todo. Temos assim, por um lado, as opiniões, os interesses e os valores dos diferentes indivíduos e dos diferentes grupos que se confrontam numa dada comunidade política e, por outro, a intenção de representar um todo, «um povo», sem fractura. Trata-se, de resto, de uma intenção que, numa democracia pluralista, como a portuguesa, será sempre uma intenção «de parte», uma vez que pressupõe a apresentação de um projecto político que seja distintivo e que se diferencie dos projectos alternativos apresentados pelos demais partidos políticos em nome desse mesmo povo que se representa. Representar os cidadãos colectivamente é, portanto, uma tarefa complexa e é-o sobretudo nas sociedades actuais. O processo de modernização social trouxe consigo cidadãos mais individualizados, mais autónomos, mais críticos, mais cognitivamente mobilizados e, por conseguinte, também menos atraídos pelas ideias e organizações mediadoras que tradicionalmente actuaram entre a sociedade e o Estado. Isto acontece sobretudo se essas organizações assumirem uma natureza formal e hierárquica e se as ideias que defendem tomarem a forma de sistemas compreensivos, organizadores do pensamento e acção humanas, como são as ideologias. Para além de enfrentar o desafio dos cidadãos «críticos», a representação política confronta-se hoje com o facto de serem várias as democracias em que a distribuição fortemente assimétrica de recursos, a capacidade organizativa e o poder privam o processo de comunicação e constituição mútua entre representantes e representados, que a relação representativa democrática pressupõe e exige, ao mesmo tempo que catapulta desproporcionalmente a voz e a influência política de segmentos minoritários da sociedade (por exemplo, da opinião publicada e dos líderes de opinião: Bartels 2006; Adams e Ezrow 2009). Temos assim definidos dois grandes grupos de cidadãos – os críticos e os alienados –, que estão na base da ideia, hoje largamente veiculada, de que, se as democracias desenvolvidas estão, de facto, a passar por uma crise, esta é seguramente uma crise de representação política.\n\n81\n\nCrise da representação ou crise do partido político?\n\nSendo que os partidos políticos são o principal canal através do qual os cidadãos são representados nas democracias representativas, não será de estranhar que a alegada «crise da representação» seja vulgarmente assimilada a uma «crise do partido político» (Dalton e Wattenberg 2002). Uma crise que, no entender de muitos analistas, decorre da progressiva concentração da acção partidária nas funções procedimental e governativa (com destaque para a conquista de cargos públicos e o recrutamento de líderes e funcionários para o exercício desses cargos e a organização do parlamento e do governo), em detrimento da função representativa (de formulação de clivagens e dos termos do conflito político; de selecção, definição e articulação coerente de interesses e exigências compatíveis com uma certa ideia de vantagem mútua ou de bem comum). Como explicam Katz e Mair, em razão da sua progressiva cartelização ou viragem para o Estado, os partidos políticos terão perdido centralidade na constituição e organização das preferências do eleitorado; e, tendo deixado os partidos de ser agentes dos eleitores, os eleitores terão perdido interesse na sua representação pelos partidos, deslocalizando-a, sempre que possível, para outras instituições (Katz e Mair 2009, 762). Este diagnóstico da condição actual dos partidos políticos tem encontrado eco em estudos sobre os partidos portugueses. A cartelização dos nossos partidos é tida por «originária», porque decorrente da falta de raízes organizacionais fortes desde o momento primeiro da instituição do sistema partidário democrático em Portugal. Momento esse em que os partidos terão assumido o monopólio da representação política menos pela sua ligação à sociedade do que pela sua ligação ao Estado e pelo controlo das regras eleitorais que essa ligação proporciona até hoje (Jalali 2007). E, apesar de serem conhecidas diferenças significativas no que toca às estruturas de organização local que os diferentes partidos vieram a desenvolver subsequentemente, é também sabido que os partidos portugueses interagem com os seus eleitorados de forma fugaz, praticamente limitada aos períodos de campanha eleitoral, com o sistema de listas fechadas, a propiciar, no geral, uma comunicação e papel social fracos dos partidos. Além deste parco enraizamento social e fraca interacção com os representados, o pragmatismo ou catch-all-ismo dos partidos, especialmente os do centro do espectro político-partidário – PS e PSD –, que são também aqueles cujo voto se encontra menos socialmente ancorado, é apontado como traduzindo-se numa flexibilidade, indefinição e tacticismo ideológicos que dificultam a identificação partidária e os tornam\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n82\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\npotencialmente indistintos entre si, alimentando um sentimento difuso de que os partidos são todos iguais e apresentam uma escolha pouco relevante ao eleitorado (Freire et al. 2002). Iguais talvez, mas já não necessariamente permutáveis, visto que os estudos eleitorais indicam que os eleitores tenderão menos a transferir o seu voto de um para outro dos partidos do chamado «centrão» do que os partidos a ganhar votos da, ou a perder votos para a, abstenção, que, como sabemos, tende a ser elevada entre nós. O cenário que estas análises desenham é, por conseguinte, o de partidos cujo combate é menos pela convicção do que contra a indiferença (ou a sua fomentação por relação aos seus mais directos adversários). Partidos em que o enraizamento e o apoio social perdem a favor do «estatismo» e do «aparelhismo», o que os constitui como instituições essencialmente «introvertidas», no sentido de «funcionarem para dentro» ou de estarem fechadas sobre si. E neste movimento de introversão toda a representação da sociedade pelo Estado que não se veja mediada pela força superior dos interesses do partido (e, em particular, dos seus membros) enfrenta sérias dificuldades. O diagnóstico é sombrio, mas, mais do que averiguar da sua adesão à realidade, o que cabe no âmbito necessariamente limitado deste estudo é determinar se os portugueses se sentem «presentes» ou representados naquilo que os partidos políticos alegadamente dizem, ou fazem, em seu nome e, a não se sentirem assim, se encontram canais alternativos de representação e quais. Os resultados apurados através do inquérito do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» dão-nos conta do grau de desidentificação entre cidadãos e partidos em Portugal. Quando questionados sobre se algum dos partidos políticos existentes representa as suas opiniões razoavelmente bem, 47,6% dos inquiridos, quase metade, respondem negativamente, sendo de 14,1% a percentagem daqueles que, não respondendo que «não», dizem simplesmente «não saber» ou «não responder». Mas, se são muitos os portugueses que não se revêem nas posições apresentadas a público pelos partidos que integram o nosso sistema político-partidário, também não é certo que encontrem fora dele outras instituições ou agentes em cujas posições revejam. Com efeito, um em cada três portugueses não consegue encontrar qualquer instituição ou agente, de entre os elencados no inquérito (a saber, partidos políticos, Presidente da República, movimentos sociais de protesto, Igreja, sindicatos e autarcas), que creia dar «voz» às suas preocupações (àquilo que querem, ou preferem, ou simplesmente pensam desta ou daquela questão). Entre os portugueses que conseguem encontrar neste sistema representativo entendido em sentido alargado canais de expressão política, a maioria –\n\n83\n\nembora se trate, neste caso, de uma maioria muito relativa (21,7%) – nomeia o Presidente da República como sendo quem melhor representa as suas preocupações (note-se que o inquérito de opinião foi aplicado antes da polémica em torno das reformas do Presidente, que veio provocar uma cisão notória entre a população e o seu mais alto magistrado). Ao Presidente seguem-se, a grande distância, os movimentos sociais de protesto (12%) e, ex aequo, os sindicatos e os partidos políticos (ambos com 10%). Atrás dos partidos vêm a Igreja (7%), e, com menos de metade do valor, os autarcas (3%), cuja função de conceder «voz» às preocupações das populações, tal como percepcionada pelos inquiridos, é, quando muito, residual. Este resultado é especialmente interessante se tivermos em conta a hipótese comummente aventada pela literatura de que a distância face ao representante é um factor importante na avaliação do laço representativo com ele estabelecido, sendo que uma maior proximidade (tal como aquela proporcionada ao nível do poder local) aumentaria a probabilidade de «sentir-se representado» ou de sentir esse laço representativo como forte. Em Portugal, porém, a proximidade física dos autarcas aos inquiridos não os exime de serem colocados numa posição negligenciável no que toca à representação da «voz» daqueles que os elegem – o que pode ser parcialmente explicado pela reduzida voz dos próprios autarcas em questões políticas nacionais e pelo facto de a sua função ser entendida menos como representativa do que uma questão de fazer «algo por nós» ou «em nosso benefício» (para a potencial diferença entre ambas as relações, v. Brito Vieira e Runciman 2008, cap. 1). No cômputo geral, o fosso entre potenciais representantes e potenciais representados parece ser generalizado em Portugal e não deixar, de todo, os partidos políticos de fora: com apenas 10% dos inquiridos a encontrarem no discurso e acção dos partidos reflexo das preocupações que mais os afligem, é caso para suspeitar de que algo vai mal na selecção, definição e articulação que os partidos dão dos principais interesses e exigências dos cidadãos.\n\nEstudo da representação política em Portugal\n\nSe atentarmos nos estudos sobre a representação política que vêm sendo realizados em Portugal, constataremos que tendem a seguir o modelo mais comummente adoptado em estudos internacionais congéneres, isto é, o modelo das congruências (Miller e Strokes 1963; Belchior 2008; Freire et al. 2010). Este modelo procura determinar a distância entre representantes e representados em termos do seu autoposicionamento ideológico esquerda-direita e em termos das suas preferências por políticas públicas.\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n84\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\nA análise de congruências é, no entanto, apenas uma das formas possíveis de estudo da representação política e, na ausência de estudos diacrónicos, como acontece no nosso país, consegue dizer-nos pouco sobre os mecanismos causais pelos quais as eventuais justaposições entre as «preferências» dos governantes e as «preferências» dos governados se formam. Todos os modelos de análise da representação política estão inscritos numa concepção particular de democracia (desde as concepções minimalistas, em que a representação surge como uma forma de elitismo, e a democracia representativa, como mais uma forma de governo misto, a concepções mais substantivas, com o seu enfoque na interacção entre as esferas públicas, informal e formal, no discurso, na deliberação, no juízo e na capacidade crítica, que apenas a política mediada permitiria) e do que conta (ou não) como representação política democrática. A este respeito, importa salientar que o modelo das congruências tende a não reconhecer à democracia representativa uma natureza distintiva, antes a avaliando à luz de um ideal que é o da democracia directa: a saber, um ideal de identidade entre governantes e governados, em relação ao qual a democracia representativa será sempre e apenas «um lamentável substituto» (Dahl 1982, 13). Em contraste com a teorização da representação como substituição ou como identificação, as teorias mais recentes da representação democrática vêm propondo que o reconhecimento e mesmo a afirmação de uma certa separação entre representantes e representados é da própria essência da representação democrática (Plotke 1997; Urbinati 2006; Disch 2011). É, de resto, no reconhecimento desta diferença, ou desta ausência de um fechamento, que se funda a ideia da representação enquanto processo dinâmico, exigindo uma interlocução e negociação continuadas a três níveis diferentes e comunicantes entre si: entre representados e representantes, dos representados entre si e dos representantes entre si. Agindo em nome de um eleitorado internamente diverso, os representantes têm de co-construir e oferecer respostas às preferências dos representados. Mas estas não são os únicos factores relevantes na representação. Outros cidadãos, além dos seus eleitores ou simpatizantes, terão preferências diversas, porventura conflituantes. E o representante terá a sua própria concepção do que melhor realiza, ora os interesses de quem mais directamente representa, ora o bem-estar da população em geral, uma concepção que deve submeter ainda ao escrutínio dos representados e dos demais representantes com assento parlamentar. O tratamento da responsividade como a marca distintiva da representação democrática permeia o modelo das congruências; porém, tem dificuldade em conciliar-se com estudos empíricos recentes sobre a forma como as preferências\n\n85\n\nse formam e que nos dizem que, se os eleitores desenvolvem preferências suficientemente estáveis e coerentes para serem susceptíveis de representação, é graças à co-construção dessas preferências no âmbito da competição político-partidária e das relações representativas que a informam (Druckman e Lupia 2000). A noção dominante de que representar é uma questão de resposta ou correspondência a preferências preestabelecidas coaduna-se, de resto, igualmente mal com a constatação de que a representação é, no seu essencial, um processo relacional, dinâmico e interactivo em que os representantes não apenas respondem a preferências expressas no passado, como também, se não mesmo sobretudo, antecipam relacionamentos futuros. Esta orientação futura da representação dita «antecipatória» (Mansbridge 2003), que desloca o seu olhar do eleitor passado para as posições políticas do mesmo eleitor na próxima eleição, assenta na ideia de que o eleitor avalia a performance do representante sobretudo na base de preferências desenvolvidas ao longo do seu mandato. Isto abre aos representantes a possibilidade de tomarem o seu mandato como uma oportunidade para trabalharem activamente na definição de clivagens, na prioritarização de escolhas, na apresentação de alternativas de acção colectiva – ou seja, na reconfiguração dos termos do próprio debate político e das preferências que o informam (Disch 2011). Este tipo de representação antecipatória é necessariamente dinâmico, constitutivo e reflexivo, exigindo critérios normativos de avaliação da qualidade e democraticidade da relação representativa mais complexos e sistémicos do que o modelo das congruências, centrado, como se encontra, na correspondência de opiniões e posições, poderia avançar. De resto, vários pressupostos do modelo das congruências – de que o processo representativo é linear e diádico; de que ele assenta em preferências que lhe são exógenas; de que a eleição resulta num mandato político claro; de que representação e responsividade a preferências predefinidas são uma e a mesma coisa; de que os representantes conhecem as preferências dos representados (e vice-versa); de que os eleitores estão politicamente informados, têm preferências claras e votam de acordo com elas – têm sido alvo de uma problematização teórica e empírica crescente (Eulau e Karps 1977; Thomassen 1994; Disch 2011; Baum e Potter 2008). Estes pressupostos são criticados não apenas por tolherem a dimensão constitutiva da representação política, como também pela sua parca adesão à realidade, uma adesão que poderá conhecer obstáculos acrescidos num país como Portugal, em que os politólogos têm caracterizado a relação representativa como «curto-circuitada» pelo quase total desconhecimento, por parte dos eleitores, dos deputados e programas partidários, pela dilui Mónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n86\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\nção das fronteiras ideológicas esquerda-direita e por um autoposicionamento ideológico e identificação partidária dos eleitores ao arrepio das suas «reais preferências» (para uma tal caracterização do laço representativo, v., entre outros, Magalhães 2004). Abre-se assim espaço a abordagens alternativas ao estudo da representação em Portugal.\n\nRepresentação subjectiva\n\nO estudo que aqui se apresenta reveste-se de um carácter assumidamente exploratório e difere de estudos anteriores sobre a representação política em Portugal em dois aspectos fundamentais. Primeiro, centra-se no conceito de representação subjectiva, isto é, na opinião dos cidadãos sobre se algum dos partidos que integram o nosso sistema partidário representa as suas opiniões razoavelmente bem, e examina os factores que influenciam este sentimento de se sentir ou não representado por um partido político.1 Segundo, trata não apenas da representação pelo partido, como também de outras formas de representação, de carácter formal e informal, de base eleitoral e não eleitoral. Isto acontece não apenas porque, também em Portugal, embora bem menos do que noutras democracias consolidadas, a política extravasa hoje do domínio formal da política eleitoral para outros domínios mais informais de acção política, cuja capacidade para representar a «voz» dos cidadãos e exercer influência sobre o sistema tradicional de representação política assume um peso crescente. Mas sobretudo porque a tese do declínio do partido político no exercício da sua função representativa se faz normalmente acompanhar da projecção de que, insatisfeitos com os partidos, os cidadãos tenderão, cada vez mais, a procurar instituições e agentes alternativos para a representação dos seus interesses ou para a expressão das suas posições, reivindicações e objecções mais prementes, começando, muito possivelmente, pelo seu descontentamento com o funcionamento dos mecanismos de representação formal. Ao levar em linha de conta estas diferentes\n\n87\n\n1 Neste capítulo a clivagem que será tida em primeira linha de conta é a que se interpõe entre aqueles cidadãos que se sentem representados por um partido do nosso sistema político-partidário e aqueles que não se sentem representados por nenhum deles. Não se analisará assim a percepção que os cidadãos têm quanto à sua proximidade ao partido da sua preferência ou à intensidade da sua relação representativa com esse partido, o que exigiria que se considerassem, entre outras questões, o tipo de partido e de eleitorado em causa, o tipo de representação privilegiada pelo partido, o tamanho e ideologia do mesmo, as suas principais características organizacionais e condições de democraticidade interna, a sua implantação local e o tipo de comunicação e socialização política que desenvolve em relação aos seus eleitores e simpatizantes.\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n88\n\nformas de representação, o presente estudo afasta-se do entendimento comum da representação e da participação como práticas essencialmente antagónicas. Aqui, bem pelo contrário, elas são tomadas como mutuamente constitutivas, e as relações representativas, entendidas em sentido lato, eleitoral e não eleitoral, são tidas como canais privilegiados de participação e influência política. Antes de passarmos à análise dos dados recolhidos via inquérito, e porque estamos a falar de diferentes modalidades de representação, algumas das quais não são vulgarmente reconhecidas enquanto tal, importa explicitar o que neste estudo se entende por «representação».\n\nDe que falamos quando falamos de representação?\n\nA representação democrática pressupõe e implica agência, ou acção autónoma, em ambos os pólos da relação representativa: representante e representado. Assim, para que possamos falar de uma relação de representação democrática, os representados têm de estar de alguma forma implicados – isto é, de ter uma presença – na acção que o representante realiza em seu nome e de poder objectar a essa presença que lhes é representativamente dada, o que pressupõe a acção do representante no sentido de promover a autonomia e a agência dos representados. Este denominador mínimo comum é sugerido pela própria noção de que «re-presentar» é conferir presença a algo que de outra forma não a teria (e, portanto, activá-lo), ou simplesmente falar ou agir em nome de outrem, sem o remeter a um papel passivo ou substituto (Brito Vieira e Runciman 2008). A base em que esta presença se funda é, contudo, variável e não tem necessariamente de pressupor os mecanismos formais de autorização ou consentimento dos representados – por via da eleição – ou de controlo e responsabilização e prestação de contas dos representantes – por via da sua eventual não reeleição e não recondução no cargo –, que estão associados à representação pelo partido político.2 Estes mecanismos têm a grande virtude de pôr a descoberto a natureza artificial da autoridade política e promover a incerteza quanto ao exercício do poder, assim obri 2 Esta exigência de prestação de contas impende sobre toda a duração da relação representativa, sendo então essencialmente discursiva, no sentido de o representante estar obrigado a apresentar publicamente argumentos ou razões para posições assumidas e decisões tomadas (ora perante o parlamento, ora perante o seu eleitorado, ora perante o público em geral).\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\ngando o representante à prossecução dos fins políticos do representado, sujeita a um diálogo contínuo sobre que fins devam esses ser. Embora a representação política formal exija uma legitimação particularmente forte, já que os representantes eleitos gozam de poder decisório, obrigam os representados ao acatamento das suas decisões e responsabilizam-nos (desde logo fiscalmente) pelos encargos públicos através delas assumidos, a representação de tipo informal não está isenta de necessidade de legitimação. É que também ela estabelece uma relação de poder dos representantes sobre os representados, na medida em que qualquer representante que aja publicamente em nome de outrem constitui esse outrem (a sua identidade, os seus interesses, as suas reivindicações) de uma determinada forma e é na base dessa representação que visa normalmente obter reconhecimento e exercer influência sobre terceiras partes, designadamente sobre os decisores políticos. Na ausência de eleições que o legitimem no exercício desse poder, a legitimação da relação representativa dependerá do estabelecimento de equivalentes funcionais à relação entre autorização, responsividade e responsabilização, que, apesar das suas conhecidas deficiências, estrutura e delimita os ciclos eleitorais e permite o controlo dos cidadãos sobre a representação política formal que estes ciclos ancoram. Quanto mais as formas de representação informais prescindam destes mecanismos, mais questionáveis serão também as suas credenciais democráticas. Quando olhamos para a sociedade civil em busca de agentes que possam ser candidatos ao exercício de funções representativas, rapidamente chegamos a duas conclusões. Primeiro, que diferentes agentes tenderão a representar diferentes coisas, de forma diversa e para fins também eles diferenciados. Segundo, que a representação não eleitoral não é substitutiva da eleitoral, visto que preenche funções diferentes daquela. Comecemos pelo primeiro ponto. Dois casos de representação não eleitoral, os movimentos sociais de protestos e o sindicatos, um grupo e uma organização que procuram a posição de porta-vozes de determinadas causas e/ou interesses sociais, servem para exemplificar a grande variedade de formas que a representação não eleitoral pode assumir. Os movimentos sociais de protesto representam, normalmente, causas específicas, sem continuidade temporal e sem buscarem a conquista de poder. Tendem, de resto, a recusar a partidarização, a institucionalização e o poder que dela advém. O seu objectivo é influenciar a agenda governamental, não desenhá-la ou executá-la, seja independentemente, seja pela participação em estruturas formais de negociação convocadas pelo Estado. Não é, pois, difícil identificar diferenças substantivas entre mo 89\n\nvimentos sociais e sindicatos. Ao contrário dos movimentos, com a sua estrutura horizontal e a sua relutância em assumir explicitamente uma postura representativa ou em participar no poder, os sindicatos são organizações formais e hierárquicas, dotadas de continuidade temporal, cuja capacidade para agir, pelo menos em países em que, à semelhança de Portugal, o neocorporativismo se institucionaliza na concertação social, está parcialmente dependente do seu reconhecimento como interlocutores válidos pelo Estado, que os convoca para os seus espaços de negociação e lhes atribui legitimidade para falar em nome dos interesses de um determinado grupo (neste caso, os trabalhadores). Passemos então ao segundo ponto: o contraste entre representação informal, por agentes e instituições da sociedade civil, e representação formal, pelo partido político, nos poderes legislativo e executivo, e a sua relação recíproca. Desde logo, importa assinalar que nem todas as clivagens que as instituições ou agentes da sociedade civil representam se traduzem necessariamente em dimensões de conflito político. Quando são eficazmente trazidas à consciência pública enquanto tal, porém, podem obrigar o sistema de representação formal ao reconhecimento e tratamento de dimensões de conflitualidade política até então por si ignoradas. De igual forma, se os agentes e instituições da sociedade civil nem sempre representam identidades políticas, por vezes articulam explicitamente identidades políticas alternativas ou mesmo opostas às partidárias (veja-se, por exemplo, o movimento ambientalista, que apenas posteriormente se institucionaliza em vários partidos «Verdes», ou a postura antipartidária e pró-independente protagonizada por alguns movimentos sociais). Ao contrário dos partidos, estes outros grupos da sociedade civil com pretensões representativas não visam ganhar eleições nem que o seu eventual sucesso eleitoral se traduza em legislação e decisões vinculativas para todos. Antes procuram conceder o poder de voz, de influência e/ou de acesso a determinados grupos, seja através, seja independentemente, da persuasão da maioria. Assim sendo, não incorrem na obrigação de prestar contas pela sua acção ao público em geral, embora o façam cada vez mais, por questões de transparência e de legitimidade, e não têm de ter em consideração o equilíbrio das relações entre diferentes interesses numa sociedade. Apenas aos partidos políticos incumbem necessariamente estas duas obrigações, assim como a de integrar diferentes arenas de contestação e um sem-número de clivagens, num número mais reduzido, mais simplificado e mais generalizado de desacordos que possam ser trabalháveis e formar a base de uma proposta política coerente. É, por conseguinte, apenas no pressuposto errado de que os partidos são\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n90\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\ntão simplesmente responsáveis pela agregação de interesses ou de preferências preestabelecidas, numa perspectiva competitiva, que se pode querer que eles sejam perfeitamente permutáveis com outros actores corporativos ou com grupos de interesses orientados para a representação de um interesse seccional específico. Como Noberto Bobbio bem sublinhou, se a «representação seccional» oferecida por diferentes grupos de interesses se pode mostrar adequada a numerosos subdomínios da vida pública, na arena política não pode servir de substituto para a defesa de visões gerais da sociedade avançadas pelos partidos (Bobbio 1987, 51). Tanto mais assim quanto o próprio processo pelo qual os interesses destes diferentes grupos são integrados se encontre sujeito à negociação política e a visões normativas quanto à importância relativa desses interesses, que compete especialmente aos partidos políticos articular. Assim, quando neste capítulo se fala em canais «alternativos» de representação política, não se quer sugerir que estes canais de que se fala sejam «substitutivos» dos partidos políticos ou desempenhem iguais funções, nem tão-pouco que a articulação entre a representação de base eleitoral, esmagadoramente partidária, e de base não eleitoral, tendencialmente extrapartidária, seja aproblemática. Recorde-se, a este título, que, se, por um lado, a multiplicação dos canais de representação informal pode servir o princípio democrático de influência de todos os afectados sobre as decisões políticas que os afectam, onde essa multiplicação de oportunidades de representação aumenta desproporcionalmente a presença, ou a influência, dos socialmente mais favorecidos e bem organizados, a igualdade simples em que a representação eleitoral se funda pode ver-se duplamente afectada. A isto acresce ainda um outro perigo: a multiplicação do número de agentes que, na base da reivindicação de um estatuto representativo, participem nos processos conducentes à decisão política pode não apenas conduzir a importantes bloqueios e impasses, como também dificultar a unificação da responsabilidade pelas decisões finalmente tomadas. Torna-se assim potencialmente mais exigente a identificação de eventuais «responsáveis», com vista à sua punição pelos efeitos da acção colectiva prosseguida, o que pode contribuir para o crescente desencanto do cidadão comum pela política – essa mesma que o envolvimento de representantes da sociedade civil no processo de decisão política visava à partida minorar. É, de resto, o facto de apenas o partido político constituir um «público forte», simultaneamente responsável pela formação da opinião e pela tomada de decisões que, sendo tomadas em nome de todos, vinculam não apenas os membros do partido, mas todos os cidadãos, que faz com que\n\n91\n\na sua autorização se tenha de consubstanciar num acto explícito: o voto. Já a representação não eleitoral, por grupos e associações da sociedade civil, tende a romper com os procedimentos estabelecidos para a representação da voz popular, no exercício dos poderes legislativo e executivo. Assim, em muitas ocasiões, ela está a cargo de um agente não autorizado, ou autorizado apenas por um grupo mais limitado, que sai a público, propondo-se falar e agir em nome de um outro grupo, mais alargado. A reivindicação representativa avançada pode ter por base afinidades de diversa ordem (de interesses, de identidade, de perspectivas, de causas). Estas reivindicações podem vir a provar ter ressonância alargada num grupo bem mais vasto de cidadãos. Mas a sua validação é quase sempre apenas retrospectiva. Isto é, primeiro age-se em nome de um grupo de referência, invocando-se interesses, identidades, perspectivas ou causas comuns, e apenas depois se conquista ou não o apoio (ou pelo menos a não objecção) desse grupo que se quer mobilizar por via da sua representação. Em resumo, no caso dos representantes ditos «não autorizados», o representante e o representado podem estar ligados por interesses ou posições que partilham, mas que não haviam sido previamente articulados, e estes interesses ou posições comuns podem dar a um grupo de indivíduos presença nas acções de outro grupo ou indivíduo (que o primeiro não autorizou previamente a agir em seu nome), sendo que essa presença, que lhes é dada, pode ser responsável pela activação do grupo (representado) enquanto tal – isto é, enquanto agente colectivo, com consciência de si mesmo e dos seus interesses. Um caso concreto ajuda na ilustração. Imaginemos que a comissão de utentes de uma via rodoviária SCUT («Sem Custos para o Utilizador») decide, por uma votação interna à comissão, organizar uma acção de protesto contra o aumento das portagens e que outros utilizadores dessa SCUT, mas não pertencentes à comissão, se revêem nas reivindicações apresentadas às autoridades políticas nessa mesma acção. Ou suponhamos que um indivíduo isolado ou uma organização não governamental interpõem, em tribunal, uma acção popular, em defesa de um ecossistema ameaçado pela construção de uma barragem, e que, tomando conhecimento da iniciativa pelos media, grande parte da população afectada, e alienadamente representada pelo indivíduo ou organização, sai à rua em seu apoio, assinando mesmo uma petição nesse sentido. Temos aqui duas situações em que alguém não apenas actua no interesse de outrem, como também, e decisivamente, confere presença a esses interesses perante uma terceira parte – os meios de comunicação social, o tribunal, a população portuguesa, em geral, os seus representantes políti Mónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n92\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\ncos. Esta presença, que a representação lhes confere, mobiliza o grupo de indivíduos que nela se revêem, passando os membros a estabelecer uma relação de identificação entre si, que é a base da sua emergência, enquanto agente colectivo, capaz de agir em função de interesses comuns. A comunhão de interesses (que poderia, noutros casos, ser uma comunhão de opiniões, identidades, valores ou posicionamentos em relação a causas ou políticas públicas concretas, ou mesmo uma experiência partilhada de exclusão) é aqui o eixo sobre o qual gira a relação representativa. Mas o que conta, em cada um dos casos, como mecanismo de autorização, responsabilização e objecção varia. As associações civis de carácter voluntário, como, por exemplo, um sindicato ou o nosso grupo ambientalista, falam potencialmente em nome de um grupo pelo simples facto de contarem com membros e por relação a eles apresentam mecanismos de autorização e responsabilização típicos deste tipo de associação (filiação, pagamento de quotas, mecanismos institucionais internos de selecção de porta-vozes, de justificação e sufrágio das posições a tomar em público, de expressão do desacordo, e de objecção terminal, com corte do laço representativo pela saída da associação). Mas, à semelhança do indivíduo que interpõe a acção popular em tribunal, elas podem também apresentar-se como actuando em nome de um grupo mais alargado, para além dos seus membros, como é o caso das populações locais supostamente afectadas de forma negativa pela construção da barragem. Desta feita, os mecanismos de responsividade serão mais informais, e muitas vezes com uma forte vertente discursiva (por exemplo, apresentar às populações razões para que os reconheçam como representantes legítimos dos seus interesses), ou de natureza horizontal (por exemplo, quando uma ONG policia as reivindicações representativas da outra), ao passo que os mecanismos de autorização serão essencialmente retrospectivos, manifestando-se na capacidade que a associação tenha (ou não) de atrair simpatizantes junto das populações, que, para tal, terão de se rever na posição que a associação assumiu em seu nome ou na «voz» que lhes conferiu. Ter em conta esta diversidade de formas de representação e dos critérios de autorização, responsividade e responsabilização democrática que lhes assistem é crucial para o nosso estudo, já que nele se procura determinar se os cidadãos portugueses estão a encontrar «voz» ou expressão para as suas posições, preocupações e reivindicações em canais para além desse canal tradicional de expressão política que é o partido e se o fazem hoje mais em complemento ou em alternativa a este. Para tal, torna-se necessário passar à análise empírica de um conjunto de dados recentemente recolhidos no âmbito do projecto «Barómetro da Qualidade da\n\n93\n\nDemocracia», sediado no Instituto de Ciências Sociais da Universidade de Lisboa, começando, desde logo, pela enumeração das três questões concretas que enquadram a análise.\n\nRepresentação política em Portugal: indicadores empíricos\n\nO nosso principal objectivo, no que se segue, é averiguar em que medida os cidadãos portugueses (1) sentem que as suas posições são razoavelmente representadas pelos partidos políticos existentes, (2) encontram noutros agentes e/ou instituições canais mais satisfatórios para a expressão das suas opiniões, ou (3) se vêem simplesmente órfãos de canais de representação das questões que mais os preocupam. Esta questão é explorada com base nos dados apurados através do inquérito de opinião realizado no âmbito do projecto «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia», que, no mês de Julho de 2011, recolheu as opiniões de 1207 respondentes sobre diferentes dimensões da democracia portuguesa (para mais detalhes, v. introdução a este volume). Crucialmente para o estudo que aqui se conduz, este inquérito solicitava directamente aos cidadãos que especificassem que instituição ou agentes melhor davam voz às suas preocupações, proporcionando-lhes hipóteses de escolha, que, para além dos partidos políticos, incluíam cinco outras alternativas. Algumas eram ainda de base eleitoral, mas de âmbito, ora nacional, ora local: o Presidente da República e os autarcas. Outras eram de base associativa, mas com conhecidas ligações partidárias e responsabilidade pela representação de interesses em instâncias de concertação social, de natureza neocorporativa: os sindicatos. Um terceiro grupo era composto por grupos de natureza menos hierárquica, menos formalizada, menos perene e mais centrada na dimensão de conflito social que, a par da integração social, é, por vezes, assumida pelos sindicatos. Falamos aqui dos movimentos sociais de protesto, que, ao contrário dos sindicatos, tendem a resistir a associações partidárias e à institucionalização, embora nem sempre com sucesso. Por fim, foi incluída na lista uma instituição apartidária, a Igreja, que, apesar da sua natureza não política, ocasionalmente traz questões políticas específicas à consciência pública e à própria agenda política, designadamente questões decorrentes do seu grande envolvimento no sector social (por exemplo, a pobreza) ou questões de ordem moral (por exemplo, o aborto). Uma vez que as hipóteses de resposta previstas no questionário incluíam, além dos partidos políticos, estas cinco outras alternativas – a\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n94\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\n95\n\nsaber, o Presidente da República, os autarcas, os sindicatos, os movimentos sociais de protesto e a Igreja –, podemos usar esta questão como uma variável dependente para avaliar da existência e extensão da «crise do partido» em Portugal enquanto instituição representativa.3 É de sublinhar, nestas considerações preliminares, que na nossa análise temos em consideração a categoria residual «não sabe». Isto é importante para que possamos avaliar se os respondentes que não encontram no partido um canal satisfatório de representação das suas posições encontram canais de expressão alternativos noutras instituições ou agentes do Estado ou da sociedade civil, ou se, pelo contrário, se verifica um tal grau de alienação face à política que os leva antes a integrar esta categoria residual, de quem «não sabe» quem possa dar voz às suas preocupações. Por esta razão, cremos que uma análise da alegada «crise do partido» no exercício da sua função representativa estaria incompleta se ignorássemos esta categoria. Para captarmos a multidimensionalidade da representação política tivemos em consideração, na nossa análise, um conjunto de questões que reflectem as atitudes dos respondentes face à participação política, à responsividade do sistema político e à representação institucionalizada, de carácter eleitoral e político-partidário. Ao passo que a satisfação com a representação pelos partidos foi aferida questionando-se directamente os respondentes acerca da existência de um partido político, no sistema partidário português, que represente as suas opiniões relativamente bem, as outras duas componentes da análise foram construídas a partir de dois outros conjuntos de questões. Para a participação utilizámos integralmente a bateria de oito questões incluídas no inquérito para determinar qual a atitude dos inquiridos relativamente à eficácia da participação política, convencional ou não convencional. Já no caso das questões sobre a responsividade do sistema político português, seleccionámos as quatro questões que, no inquérito, indicam cepticismo face à elite política e aos interesses que movem a sua acção. Aplicámos, de seguida, a técnica estatística da análise de agrupamentos (também conhecida por análise de cluster) a cada uma destas diferentes baterias de questões, a fim de agruparmos os inquiridos de acordo com as suas semelhanças atitudinais relativamente à participação política e à responsividade do sistema. Isto permite-nos agrupar os respondentes de acordo com os seus diferentes perfis, sendo provável que um tal agrupamento nos dê mais informação do que uma análise de cada variável, con 3 Para a redacção precisa de todas as questões analisadas neste capítulo, v. o apêndice ao livro.\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n96\n\nsiderada separadamente. Em concreto, o método seguido neste estudo é o da aglomeração hierárquica de Ward, que procura simultaneamente maximizar as semelhanças intragrupo e as dissemelhanças inter-grupo, utilizando o quadrado das distâncias euclidianas como medidas de proximidade.4 Para ambos os núcleos de questões, tanto o índice CalinskiHarabash quanto o índice Duda-Hart sugerem a divisão dos inquiridos em três agrupamentos distintos. O quadro 3.1 mostra o resultado para as oito questões relativamente à eficácia da participação política, tal como percebida pelos inquiridos. Sendo que excluímos todos os respondentes com pelo menos um valor a menos numa das oito questões, esta análise inclui 1034 respondentes apenas, isto é, cerca de 86% da amostra. Os valores apresentados no quadro indicam os valores médios de cada um dos três grupos formados nos oito indicadores. As variáveis são codificadas de forma que 1 corresponda sempre a «muito eficaz», 2 a «eficaz», 3 a uma posição «neutral», 4 a «não muito eficaz» e 5 «ineficaz». Os dados a negrito representam os valores extremos dentro de cada um dos agrupamentos. Como se poderá verificar, há vários resultados que se destacam de imediato e que importa discutir com mais detalhe. No cômputo geral, o agrupamento 1, que é também o maior agrupamento, com cerca de 54% dos respondentes, crê que participar na vida política portuguesa produz resultados ou é eficaz. Dentro deste grupo, a que chamaremos «eficaz», votar é considerada a forma mais produtiva de participação política e a participação em movimentos sociais a forma menos eficaz. Globalmente, contudo, a amplitude entre os meios é reduzida. O agrupamento 2, com cerca de 19% dos respondentes, é o mais pequeno e tem uma atitude mais céptica do que o primeiro quanto à capacidade de influenciar o sistema político ou de despoletar mudança por via da participação política. Revela, todavia, no seu conjunto, uma tendência para a adopção de uma atitude «neutral» relativamente aos efeitos da participação, razão pela qual nos referiremos, daqui em diante, a este agrupamento como «quem sabe» (pode valer a pena participar). A participação em acções de protesto e a colaboração com partidos são tidas por nada eficazes enquanto formas de influenciarem o processo político. À semelhança dos anteriores, porém, também os respondentes deste grupo tendem a consideram o voto a forma mais eficaz de participação\n\n4 Para uma introdução à análise de agrupamentos, v. Bartholomew et al. (2008) e Everitt et al. (2001).\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\n97\n\npolítica. Finalmente, no agrupamento 3, um em cada quatro inquiridos considera a participação política ineficaz. É interessante, todavia, notar que, dentro desta avaliação globalmente negativa, o voto recebe uma avaliação mais neutral, enquanto assinar petições é considerada a forma menos eficaz para tentar mudar o estado das coisas. Se o quadro 3.1 nos deu os resultados da análise às oito questões relativas à participação, o quadro 3.2 dá-nos os resultados da análise às quatro questões relativas à responsividade. Novamente, os respondentes com pelo menos um valor a menos numa destas quatro questões foram excluídos, o que nos deixa com um total de 1111 respondentes, isto é, 92% dos inquiridos. Os valores apresentados no quadro representam os valores médios de cada um destes três grupos em cada um dos quatro indicadores. No caso da responsividade, e visto que os respondentes foram confrontados com uma afirmação, as variáveis são codificadas de forma que 1 corresponda sempre a «concordo muito», 2 a «concordo», 3 a uma\n\nQuadro 3.1 – Configurações da participação\n\nCluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 Eficaz Quem sabe Ineficaz\n\nVotar nas eleições Valor médio 2,00 3,64 2,79 SD 0,76 0,99 0,99\n\nAssinar petições Valor médio 2,30 4,21 3,61 SD 0,72 0,46 0,47\n\nParticipar em manifestações Valor médio 2,27 4,32 3,57 SD 0,72 0,52 0,78\n\nParticipar em movimentos Valor médio 2,20 4,27 3,57 de cidadãos SD 0,66 0,58 0,84\n\nContactar um político Valor médio 2,53 4,30 3,56 SD 0,91 0,52 0,97\n\nColaborar com um partido Valor médio 2,45 4,32 3,27 SD 0,86 0,49 0,99\n\nParticipar em associações Valor médio 2,29 4,30 3,45 SD 0,73 0,49 0,82\n\nAlertar a comunicação social Valor médio 2,04 4,30 2,96 SD 0,76 0,47 0,91\n\nN 562 202 270 Percentagem 54,35 19,45 26,11\n\nNota: Método Ward para a análise de agrupamento hierárquico aglomerativo.

Tal como no quadro anterior, os valores a negrito assinalam valores extremos em cada um dos agrupamentos. No geral, os resultados apurados revelam que o cepticismo relativamente à elite política é universal em Portugal, sendo as diferenças notadas apenas uma questão de grau: isto é, todos os respondentes são cépticos quanto aos desígnios da elite política, acontecendo apenas que alguns são mais cépticos do que os demais. O agrupamento 1, que é, neste caso, o mais pequeno, compreendendo cerca de 12% dos inquiridos, representa aqueles que são menos cépticos – daqui em diante, os nossos «cépticos M». Estes tendem a adoptar uma atitude neutra em relação às quatro afirmações sobre responsividade e responsabilização que lhes foram colocadas, com destaque para a directamente relacionada com o interesse dos políticos com as preocupações dos cidadãos. Revelam, no entanto, uma desconfiança maior no que se refere àquela em que a elite é pouco responsabilizada. A este primeiro grupo segue-se um grupo mais céptico, que é também o maior, contando com 57% dos respondentes. Os nossos «cépticos L» acreditam que os políticos não se interessam pelos seus problemas, mas são menos cépticos quanto à possibilidade de só se preocuparem com os seus próprios interesses. Já os muito cépticos, os nossos «cépticos XL», que representam cerca de um terço dos respondentes, concordam contundentemente com as quatro afirmações sobre a alegada falta de responsividade do sistema político e a reduzida possibilidade de responsabilização dos\n\nQuadro 3.2 – Configurações da responsividade\n\nCluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 Céticos M Céticos L Céticos XL\n\nOs políticos não se interessam Valor médio 3,02 2,27 1,41 SD 0,88 0,82 0,49\n\nOs políticos só se preocupam Valor médio 3,25 2,00 1,14 com os seus próprios interesses SD 0,49 0,63 0,34\n\nFavorecem os grandes Valor médio 2,88 2,05 1,34 interesses económicos SD 0,65 0,75 0,47\n\nSão pouco responsabilizados Valor médio 2,82 2,15 1,50 SD 0,77 0,77 0,50\n\nN 130 631 350 Percentagem 11,70 56,80 31,50\n\nNota: O método de Ward para a análise de agrupamento hierárquico aglomerativo.

Comparando a resposta dada a cada uma das questões, é notório que os «cépticos XL» retraem um pouco o seu esmagador cepticismo por relação à questão de que os políticos são pouco responsabilizados, embora acreditem veementemente que os políticos se centram nos seus próprios interesses. Estes indicadores formam a base da nossa análise da extensão da alegada «crise do partido político», no exercício da sua função representativa, em Portugal. Como foi anteriormente especificado, esta análise restringe-se à dimensão subjectiva da representação, isto é, ao sentir-se ou não representado pelas posições de algum dos partidos que integram o sistema partidário português. Como variáveis de controlo, utilizámos indicadores sócio-económicos obtidos no âmbito do inquérito.5 Já o sexo é uma variável dummy, indicando se o respondente é do sexo masculino ou feminino. A variável «educação» foi recodificada em cinco categorias distintas, «primária incompleta», «primária completa», «ensino secundário incompleto», «ensino secundário completo» e «ensino superior». De igual forma, incluímos a variável «estatuto sócio-económico», que se organiza numa escala de A (mais alto) a E (mais baixo). A variável «colector de informação» indica a intensidade com que os respondentes têm contacto e se expõem (ou não) à informação de natureza política publicada na imprensa e a variável «frequência da igreja» funciona como um indicador de religiosidade. Incluímos também variáveis dummy para as áreas metropolitanas de Lisboa e do Porto e um controlo para a «satisfação com a democracia». Finalmente, tomámos a ideologia do respondente em consideração, recodificando-a em cinco categorias, a saber, «esquerda», «centro-esquerda», «centro», «centro-direita» e «direita». Contudo, tal como foi sublinhado por relação à nossa variável dependente da escolha da instituição ou pessoa em que o inquirido se vê representado, cremos que, para uma análise compreensiva do tópico em questão, é indispensável ter em linha de conta os respondentes que não declaram qualquer ideologia. Por conseguinte, na análise multivariada, a variável dummy «não declarados» contrasta aqueles que declaram uma ideologia com aqueles que não o fazem. Na próxima secção centramo-nos numa análise mais detalhada da relação entre a dimensão subjectiva da representação e a escolha da instituição ou agente que é tido por melhor representar as opiniões dos inquiridos.\n\n5 Para mais detalhes, v. o apêndice.\n\nCrise do partido e (ou) crise de representação?\n\nPara explorar a relação entre os indicadores que são do nosso interesse socorremo-nos da análise de correspondência (AC), uma técnica exploratória que nos permite representar tabelas de contingência de forma gráfica. Embora esta técnica tenha sido adoptada em muitas áreas disciplinares «como um método altamente informativo e intuitivo para a representação gráfica da associação existente entre duas ou mais variáveis categóricas» (Lombardo e Beh 2010), tem sido bem menos utilizada nos estudos de ciência política. A análise de correspondência pode ser entendida como uma extensão da análise factorial para o âmbito das variáveis categóricas. Tal como a análise factorial, procura estabelecer uma combinação linear dos dados que cubra uma parte substantiva da informação a tratar. Mais concretamente, a análise de correspondência produz coordenadas, semelhantes a cargas factoriais, que nos permitem representar graficamente estes resultados e dessa forma visualizar as relações entre as diferentes categorias de variáveis num mesmo mapa espacial (Greenacre e Pardo 2006, 193). Assim sendo, a análise de correspondência mostra-se particularmente útil para os objectivos que este capítulo se propõe, visto estarmos a lidar com dados apurados através de um inquérito de opinião, cujas respostas formam variáveis categóricas. Começamos, assim, com uma análise que toma a ideologia como princípio organizador e mostra de que forma esta se relaciona com o «sentir-se representado» por um partido político e com a escolha de uma possível instituição ou de um possível agente de representação alternativos ao partido político. Por relação à primeira questão, verificamos que quase metade dos respondentes (48%) declara que não há em Portugal qualquer partido político que represente razoavelmente as suas opiniões. Uma vez que aqueles que responderam afirmativamente a esta questão, isto é, que encontram nos partidos quem os represente, foram posteriormente questionados sobre que partido seria este, podemos representar a relação entre «sentir-se representado» por um partido e ideologia como uma relação entre simpatizantes de determinado partido e ideologia. A figura 3.1 mostra os resultados da análise de correspondência sobre ideologia e simpatizantes partidários. Juntas, estas duas dimensões explicam cerca de 88% da inércia nos dados, que deve ser entendida como equivalente à variância explicada numa análise factorial. No geral, a primeira dimensão separa a direita e o centro-direita do resto dos campos ideológicos, enquanto a segunda dimensão separa os respondentes que não declararam qualquer ideologia dos que o fizeram. É interessante\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n100\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\nnotar, porém, que o centro-direita e o centro não estão muito bem representados nesta última dimensão, visto que ambas as categorias estão próximas da origem nesta dimensão – isto é, da linha horizontal zero. Tendo em conta que as categorias representadas próximas uma da outra são as que têm níveis de associação mais elevados, esta representação gráfica sumaria as características centrais dos dados apurados num espaço dimensional simples, tornando as associações entre categorias individuais imediatamente visíveis aos olhos do leitor. Torna-se assim óbvio, por exemplo, que a CDU e o BE estão associados a uma ideologia de esquerda, ao passo que o PS se relaciona com o centro-esquerda. Já o PSD e o CDS-PP sobrepõem-se à categoria ideológica da direita, sendo que o centro-direita está também próximo de ambos os partidos. Igualmente de assinalar, porque de grande interesse, é a associação próxima entre os respondentes que não declaram qualquer ideologia e os que não\n\n101\n\nFigura 3.1 – Análise de correspondência sobre a ideologia e os apoiantes partidários\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n–1\n\n–3 –2 –1 0 1 2 3\n\nCoordenadas em normalização simétrica Dimensão 1 (55,2%)\n\nDimensão 2 (32,7%)\n\nEsquerda\n\nCentro-esquerda\n\nCentro-direita Direita\n\nCDU BE\n\nCentro\n\nNão declarado\n\nCDS-PP PSD\n\nPS\n\nSem partido\n\nse sentem representados por qualquer partido (isto é, os «sem partido»), bem como o facto de encontrarmos o centro na sua vizinhança, embora, como anteriormente mencionado, próximo da origem. Por seu lado, a figura 3.2 mostra-nos o resultado da análise de correspondência sobre ideologia e a escolha de uma instituição ou agente representativo. Esta combinação dá-nos conta de 91% da informação nos dados. Desta feita, aquilo que ressalta imediatamente é que aqueles que não declaram ideologia estão associados aos que respondem «não sabe» quando questionados sobre a sua escolha de uma instituição ou agente que canalize ou dê voz às suas preocupações. É a primeira dimensão que claramente separa estas duas categorias daqueles respondentes que se identificam com um campo ideológico e que identificam uma instituição que dê voz às suas preocupações. Contudo, é interessante notar que a categoria ideológica «centro» e a escolha do Presidente da República como porta-voz não se encontram muito bem explicadas nesta dimensão, já que caem precisamente na linha que indica a origem. Todavia, o Presidente encontra-se mais próximo dos «não declarados» do que de qualquer outra categoria que indica a ideologia. A segunda dimensão separa o centro-direita e a direita da esquerda, do centro-esquerda e, em menor medida, também do centro, e, com ele, as instituições mais cabalmente descritas como integrando o sistema político formal daquelas que se localizam fora dele. Assim sendo, e como seria de esperar, a esquerda e o centro-esquerda encontram-se associados aos sindicatos e aos movimentos sociais de protesto, ao passo que o centro-direita se aproxima dos partidos políticos, do Presidente e da Igreja e que a direita se encontra especialmente associada a esta última. Os autarcas, por seu lado, não se encontram bem representados nesta dimensão e caem exactamente na linha horizontal, indicando a origem correspondente. Chegámos anteriormente à definição de diferentes agrupamentos de respondentes de acordo com as suas atitudes perante a eficácia da representação política («eficaz», «quem sabe» e «ineficaz») e perante a responsividade da elite política às preocupações dos cidadãos (cépticos M, L e XL). Nesta segunda fase da nossa análise exploramos de que forma os grupos de respondentes detectados através da análise de agrupamentos se associam às diferentes instituições ou agentes que poderão funcionar como canais de representação das preocupações dos cidadãos. A figura 3.3 mostra-nos os resultados de uma análise de correspondência sobre a eficácia da representação e a escolha de instituição ou agente de representação. Combinadas, ambas as dimensões oferecem-nos uma explicação plena da inércia, isto é, de 100%.\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n102\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\nA primeira dimensão, que explica 94% da informação oferecida pelos dados, distingue claramente entre aqueles que entendem que a participação política é ineficaz e os dois outros grupos, muito embora o grupo daqueles que duvidam da eficiência da participação se encontre menos bem explicado por este contraste. É igualmente curioso notar que a categoria residual «não sabe» cai entre o cluster «quem sabe» e o cluster daqueles que acreditam que a participação é ineficiente, um grupo a que o Presidente se encontra também fortemente associado. A associação mais forte, porém, ocorre entre a categoria «partidos políticos» e o grupo daqueles que acreditam na eficiência da participação. Surpreendentemente, os movimentos sociais surgem, também eles, próximos deste cluster, ao passo que os sindicatos, a Igreja e, acima de tudo, o governo local – isto é, os autarcas – não se encontram bem explicados por esta representação gráfica.\n\n103\n\nFigura 3.2 – Análise de correspondência sobre a ideologia e a escolha de instituições ou agentes\n\n1\n\n0,5\n\n0\n\n–0,5\n\n–1\n\n–1 0 1 2\n\nCoordenadas em normalização simétrica Dimensão 1 (69,8%)\n\nDimensão 2 (21,4%)\n\nEsquerda\n\nCentro-esquerda\n\nCentro-direita\n\nDireita\n\nAutarcas\n\nPartidos\n\nCentro\n\nNão declarado\n\nNão sabe\n\nIgreja\n\nMovimentos\n\nSindicatos\n\nPresidente\n\nFinalmente, a figura 3.4 ilustra os resultados para a análise de correspondência entre o cepticismo perante a elite política e a identificação com uma instituição ou agente que sirva de canal privilegiado de expressão das suas preocupações. Como aconteceu anteriormente, também aqui ambas as dimensões explicam 100% da inércia. Recorde-se que os resultados da análise de agrupamentos apontavam para um cepticismo generalizado entre os respondentes relativamente à preocupação dos políticos com os interesses dos cidadãos em geral. Este cepticismo estava sempre presente, sendo a sua variação uma questão de grau apenas (entre o extremamente e o mais comedidamente céptico). Assume assim especial relevo o facto de a primeira dimensão, que explica nada mais nada menos do que 89% da informação nos dados, colocar os mais cépticos, os nossos «cépticos XL», contra as outras duas categorias. Mais ainda, ve Mónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n104\n\nFigura 3.3 – Análise de correspondência sobre a eficácia e a escolha de instituições ou agentes\n\n1,5\n\n1\n\n0,5\n\n0\n\n–0,5\n\n–1 0 1 –0,5 1,5\n\nCoordenadas em normalização simétrica Dimensão 1 (94,1%)\n\nDimensão 2 (5,9%)\n\nQuem sabe\n\nNão sabe\n\nIneficaz\n\nSindicatos\n\nAutarcas\n\nIgreja\n\n0,5\n\nEficaz Partidos\n\nMovimentos\n\nPresidente\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\nrifica-se uma sobreposição quase perfeita, portanto também uma associação quase perfeita, entre a categoria dos «cépticos XL» e a categoria dos «não sabe» quando é chegado o momento de escolher instituições ou agentes de representação, dentro ou fora do sistema político formal. Nenhuma outra categoria de resposta à questão sobre instituições ou agentes de representação se encontra próxima do grupo de respondentes altamente cépticos. Com efeito, os movimentos sociais de protesto e os sindicatos não estão bem explicados pelo contraste representado pela primeira dimensão. Os «cínicos M», por seu lado, encontram-se proximamente relacionados com os governos locais, enquanto os «cínicos L» se encontram próximos da Igreja, dos partidos e do Presidente. Os movimentos sociais e os sindicatos não se encontram bem explicados pelo contraste representado pela primeira dimensão, caindo, como caem, na\n\n105\n\nFigura 3.4 – Análise de correspondência sobre o cepticismo e a escolha de instituições ou agentes\n\n1\n\n0,5\n\n0\n\n–0,5\n\n–1\n\n–1 0 1 –0,5 1,5\n\nCoordenadas em normalização simétrica Dimensão 1 (89,1%)\n\nDimensão 2 (10,9%)\n\nNão sabe\n\nCínicoM\n\nSindicatos\n\nAutarcas\n\nIgreja\n\n0,5\n\nPartidos\n\nMovimentos\n\nPresidente CínicoXL CínicoL\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n106\n\nlinha vertical, que indica a origem. Também não se encontram bem explicados pela segunda dimensão, o que implica que os «cínicos M» são diferentes de qualquer outra categoria, tal como acontece com os movimentos sociais, uma categoria que surge essencialmente sozinha. Em suma, esta exploração gráfica preliminar dos dados recolhidos já nos deu conta de associações interessantes. Aqueles que não declaram qualquer ideologia parecem ser também aqueles que estão mais alienados do processo político, em termos gerais. Estes respondentes tendem a não encontrar um partido no sistema político-partidário português que represente as suas opiniões nem a conseguir seleccionar uma instituição ou agente que creiam dar voz às suas preocupações, para além do partido. Ainda assim, o Presidente parecer emergir como um possível canal alternativo de expressão para o grupo de respondentes sem ideologia e para aqueles que consideram que, no geral, a participação política é incapaz de produzir mudança. Já as organizações que actuam fora do sistema político formal, totalmente, como é o caso dos movimentos sociais de protesto, ou apenas em parte, como é o caso dos sindicados, representam canais de expressão apenas para aqueles que perfilham uma ideologia e acreditam que a participação política não é despicienda, podendo, em determinados casos, fazer alguma diferença. Todavia, para uma explicação mais completa, precisamos de examinar de forma mais sistemática a relação entre a escolha de uma instituição ou agente de representação que seja capaz de canalizar as preocupações dos cidadãos e a dimensão subjectiva da representação política. Uma vez que a nossa variável dependente, a escolha de instituição ou agente, é uma variável categórica nominal (não ordenada), calculámos uma regressão logística multinominal com os dados individuais do nosso inquérito. Os coeficientes apurados mostram o efeito de cada variável independente em cada categoria relativamente à categoria de referência. Estando nós interessados no contraste entre escolher um partido versus escolher outras alternativas (isto é, outras instituições ou outros agentes representativos), a primeira categoria é a nossa base de comparação, sendo assim designada como categoria de referência. Apenas para as variáveis «estatuto» e «eficácia», os testes de rácios de probabilidade realizados indicam que tratar estas variáveis como um intervalo nos levaria a uma perda de informação sobre a associação com a variável dependente. Assim sendo, convertemos as categorias individuais em variáveis dummy, deixando de fora a categoria inferior de «estatuto» (categoria E) e, no caso da eficácia, o grupo «eficiente», enquanto categoria de referência.\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\n107\n\nO quadro 3.3 apresenta os resultados do nosso cálculo como riscos relativos, o que é o mesmo que dizer, como rácios de probabilidade. De um modo geral, as relações com as nossas variáveis de controlo são as esperadas. Comparando com os partidos políticos, as pessoas de mais idade tendem a nomear a Igreja e o Presidente como canais de expressão\n\nQuadro 3.3 – Resultados da regressão logística multinominal\n\nVariáveis Sindicatos Igreja Autarcas Movimentos Presidente Não sabe\n\nRepresentado 0,436 ** 0,357 ** 0,411 0,265 *** 0,487 * 0,284 *** (0,180) (0,157) (0,249) (0,104) (0,180) (0,104) «Quem sabe» 1,164 0,848 2,678 * 0,856 1,331 1,885 * (0,479) (0,373) (1,523) (0,340) (0,473) (0,665) Ineficaz 2,573 1,128 1,393 1,166 4,788 ** 5,707 *** (1,839) (0,929) (1,738) (0,854) (3,116) (3,692) Cépticos 1,542 1,223 0,882 1,846 ** 1,368 1,823 ** (0,443) (0,370) (0,391) (0,511) (0,335) (0,455) Não declarados 0,915 0,597 0,560 0,649 1,640 2,143 * (0,494) (0,365) (0,507) (0,339) (0,773) (0,993) Satisfação com a 1,368 * 0,858 1,040 1,286 0,866 1,283 democracia (0,254) (0,158) (0,290) (0,225) (0,130) (0,201) Colector de informação 1,089 1,059 0,956 1,036 1,251 ** 1,077 (0,142) (0,146) (0,193) (0,127) (0,141) (0,122) Frequência da Igreja 0,606 *** 1,065 0,741 0,559 *** 0,689 *** 0,662 *** (0,090) (0,160) (0,164) (0,081) (0,086) (0,084) Sexo 0,951 0,760 0,541 1,230 1,074 0,750 (0,343) (0,294) (0,311) (0,425) (0,334) (0,237) Educação 0,887 1,172 1,121 1,195 1,038 0,792 (0,240) (0,327) (0,456) (0,306) (0,238) (0,185) Idade 1,007 1,455 * 1,250 1,218 1,390 ** 1,044 (0,195) (0,294) (0,375) (0,224) (0,230) (0,175) Lisboa 1,916 0,466 0,691 1,529 0,419 ** 0,590 (0,785) (0,217) (0,478) (0,600) (0,166) (0,230) Porto 0,555 0,246 ** 0,799 0,329 ** 0,907 0,572 (0,272) (0,140) (0,544) (0,163) (0,334) (0,226) Estatuto A 3,343 5,217 0,000 0,605 5,203 0,705 (3,827) (6,591) (0,007) (0,845) (5,266) (0,963) Estatuto B 1,451 3,822 * 1,355 1,325 1,949 1,190 (1,063) (3,052) (1,487) (0,911) (1,227) (0,739) Estatuto C 0,956 1,705 0,903 0,556 1,257 0,572 (0,566) (1,181) (0,824) (0,321) (0,633) (0,284) Estatuto D 0,859 2,244 1,125 0,956 0,976 0,507 (0,435) (1,353) (0,868) (0,458) (0,425) (0,211) Constante 0,485 0,279 0,593 0,447 0,921 1,770 (0,730) (0,435) (1,342) (0,634) (1,173) (2,290)\n\nObservações 687 687 687 687 687 687 Pseudo R2 0,12 0,12 0,12 0,12 0,12 0,12\n\nNota: Cálculos são riscos relativos, *** p < 0,01, ** p < 0,05, * p < 0,1.\n\ndas suas preocupações. Relativamente aos partidos políticos, a prática religiosa reduz, por seu lado, a probabilidade de se escolher quer os sindicados, quer os movimentos sociais de protesto, quer ainda o Presidente e a categoria «não sabe». As pessoas mais insatisfeitas com a democracia têm maior probabilidade de escolher os sindicatos como a instituição que melhor expressa as suas preocupações. Se, por um lado, uma exposição elevada à informação política publicada na imprensa aumenta a probabilidade de se seleccionar o Presidente como agente representativo, já viver na área metropolitana de Lisboa diminui essa probabilidade. Ser residente na área metropolitana do Porto, por contraste, reduz a probabilidade de se escolherem a Igreja ou os movimentos sociais de protesto como instituições representativas no lugar dos partidos políticos. Comparando com a categoria de estatuto inferior (categoria E), a pertença à segunda categoria de estatuto mais elevado (categoria B) aumenta substancialmente a probabilidade de a Igreja ser escolhida como canal de expressão em vez dos partidos políticos. É interessante notar, todavia, que nem o grau de educação dos inquiridos, nem o género influenciam significativamente a escolha de qualquer um dos canais alternativos de representação listados. Considerando agora as variáveis que compõem a nossa definição de representação subjectiva, não surpreende que «sentir-se representado» por um partido reduza as probabilidades de escolha de uma outra instituição ou agente de representação. Especialmente para o caso dos movimentos sociais de protesto e da categoria «não sabe», as probabilidades de escolha vêem-se reduzidas em 74% e 72%, respectivamente. Os resultados para as nossas variáveis dummy «ineficaz» e «quem sabe» têm de ser lidos por relação ao grupo que acredita que a participação política é eficaz, que, como explicámos, foi omitido como categoria de referência. Temos assim que, comparando com este grupo, que está na dúvida se a participação política muda alguma coisa em Portugal aumenta a probabilidade de se escolherem os autarcas como canal de representação ou a categoria «não sabe» relativamente aos partidos políticos, quando se é confrontado com a questão de saber qual a instituição ou agente que dá expressão às suas preocupações. Acontece, porém, que este último resultado tem de ser tomado cautelosamente, já que a aplicação de um teste de Wald mostra que a categoria «autarcas» é essencialmente indistinta do resto das alternativas. Isto não é de todo surpreendente, tendo em conta o pequeno número de casos nesta categoria (N = 19 no modelo calculado). Uma atitude mais neutra perante a possível eficácia da participação política gera, por seu turno, uma tendência substantiva para nomear o\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n108\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\nPresidente ou optar pela categoria «não sabe». Comparando com os que acreditam na eficácia da participação, e relativamente aos partidos políticos (mantendo-se tudo o demais constante), o facto de se cair no grupo «ineficaz» aumenta a probabilidade de se escolher o Presidente como porta-voz em 379% e a probabilidade de se escolher a categoria «não sabe» em 471%. Este é, de longe, o maior efeito que encontramos nos nossos cálculos. Como seria de esperar, um maior cepticismo face à elite política aumenta a probabilidade de se encontrar nos movimentos sociais de protesto um canal alternativo de expressão das preocupações, mas aumenta também, em igual proporção, a probabilidade de integrar a categoria «não sabe». Por fim, a comparação entre os respondentes que declaram a ideologia e os que não o fazem revela-nos que as pessoas menos politizadas em termos ideológicos tendem a integrar a categoria dos «não sabe».\n\n109\n\nQuadro 3.4 – Probabilidades calculadas\n\nInstituição Ideologia Probabilidade calculada\n\nSentir-se representado Eficácia da participação «Cépticos»\n\nSim Não Ineficaz Quem sabe M XL\n\nPartidos Não 0,12 0,05 0,02 0,05 0,12 0,05 Sim 0,15 0,06 0,04 0,08 0,15 0,07\n\nDiferença 0,03 0,01 0,02 0,03 0,03 0,02\n\nAutarcas Não 0,01 0,01 0,00 0,02 0,02 0,01 Sim 0,02 0,02 0,01 0,04 0,04 0,02\n\nDiferença 0,01 0,01 0,01 0,02 0,02 0,01\n\nIgreja Não 0,04 0,04 0,01 0,03 0,05 0,03 Sim 0,09 0,08 0,04 0,06 0,11 0,07\n\nDiferença 0,05 0,04 0,03 0,03 0,06 0,04\n\nPresidente Não 0,35 0,28 0,36 0,30 0,35 0,29 Sim 0,28 0,23 0,01 0,26 0,28 0,24\n\nDiferença –0,07 –0,05 –0,01 –0,04 –0,07 –0,05\n\nSindicatos Não 0,09 0,08 0,06 0,07 0,08 0,09 Sim 0,13 0,12 0,10 0,12 0,12 0,13\n\nDiferença 0,04 0,04 0,04 0,05 0,04 0,04\n\nMovimentos Não 0,06 0,09 0,03 0,05 0,06 0,09 Sim 0,13 0,19 0,07 0,12 0,12 0,19\n\nDiferença 0,07 0,10 0,04 0,07 0,06 0,10\n\nNão sabe Não 0,34 0,46 0,52 0,49 0,32 0,45 Sim 0,21 0,29 0,40 0,33 0,19 0,29\n\nDiferença –0,13 –0,17 –0,12 –0,16 –0,13 –0,16\n\nPodemos examinar com maior detalhe a relação entre a ideologia e a dimensão subjectiva da representação política através do cálculo de probabilidades estimadas do efeito de «sentir-se representado por um partido», tendo em conta a atitude dos respondentes por relação à eficácia da participação política e o seu cepticismo relativamente à elite política, bem como a correspondente variação com o facto de declararem ou não uma ideologia. O quadro 3.4 mostra os resultados deste exercício, exibindo simultaneamente variações nas probabilidades estimadas quando se muda da não declaração de uma ideologia para a declaração de uma ideologia na escala esquerda-direita. Tendo em linha de conta tudo o que foi discutido, não é inesperado que os efeitos da ideologia, conjugados com os nossos indicadores de representação subjectiva, sejam positivos, ainda que pequenos para os partidos políticos, para o autarcas e para a Igreja e, em média, maiores para o Presidente, sindicatos, movimentos sociais e a categoria «não sabe». No que diz respeito aos movimentos sociais de protesto, em geral, ter ideologia conduz a um aumento visível na probabilidade de esta categoria ser escolhida, ao passo que tem o efeito oposto sobre a probabilidade de se escolher quer o Presidente, quer a categoria «não sabe». Noutras palavras, enquanto figura que se apresenta como ocupando uma posição acima da luta político-partidária, o Presidente pode aqui preencher uma importante função como «canal de respiração» para aqueles que estão alienados da política, tal como indicado pela sua desidentificação ideológica. Já os cidadãos com posicionamento ideológico, mas desencantados com a política partidária, reservam aos movimentos sociais este importante papel. No cômputo geral, os resultados que nos são dados pelas probabilidades calculadas sublinham a importância da identificação ideológica para o envolvimento dos cidadãos na política. Isto torna-se óbvio pela consistente redução dramática das probabilidades de selecção da categoria «não sabe» pela simples passagem da não declaração de ideologia para a nomeação de qualquer orientação ideológica. A ideologia parece assim continuar a servir como um importante princípio organizador do pensamento e da acção políticos e pode aqui ser entendida como indicativa de um grau de interesse pelo político e de envolvimento na coisa pública para além do envolvimento mínimo, consubstanciado na mera exposição às notícias e no estar-se politicamente informado. Para tornar este ponto mais claro criámos tipos-ideais de respondentes, através de diferentes combinações das nossas variáveis independentes de interesse, mantendo tudo o resto constante. O quadro 3.5 dá-nos conta\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n110\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\ndo efeito da passagem de uma posição de não identificação ideológica à declaração de uma posição na dimensão ideológica esquerda-direita, sendo esse efeito avaliado por referência a três tipos distintos de respondentes. Assim, por exemplo, uma «pessoa média», entre os 18 e 32 anos, com o ensino secundário completo, níveis médios de cepticismo relativamente à elite política, que se sinta razoavelmente representada por um partido e adopte uma atitude neutra relativamente à participação, mas não professe uma ideologia, tem uma probabilidade estimada de 0,34 de seleccionar a categoria «não sabe» quando questionada sobre qual a instituição ou agente que melhor dá voz às suas preocupações. A isto segue-se a escolha do Presidente, com 0,29, dos movimentos sociais de protesto, com 0,11, e dos partidos políticos e sindicatos, cada um deles com 0,10. A Igreja tem uma probabilidade ínfima, de 0,04, de ser seleccionada por uma pessoa com tal perfil. Se, no entanto, olharmos para um pessoa com iguais características, mas que professe uma orientação ideológica, a probabilidade estimada de seleccionar a categoria «não sabe» diminui 15 pontos, para 0,19, mais precisamente. Uma vez que a probabilidade estimada de nomear o Presidente\n\n111\n\nQuadro 3.5 – Probabilidades calculadas para seleccionar uma das categorias para diferentes tipos-ideais\n\nTipo ideal Jovem (18-32), pessoa média, Partidos Igreja Presidente Sindicatos Movimentos Não sabe ensino secundário completo\n\nNão professe ideologia 0,10 0,04 0,29 0,10 0,11 0,34 Professe ideologia 0,13 0,09 0,22 0,13 0,21 0,20\n\nDiferença 0,03 0,05 –0,07 0,03 0,10 –0,16\n\nNão professe ideologia, altamente céptica, crendo 0,07 0,03 0,24 0,09 0,11 0,45 que a participação é ineficaz\n\nProfesse ideologia, altamente céptica, crendo 0,09 0,06 0,19 0,13 0,22 0,27 que a participação é ineficaz\n\nDiferença 0,02 0,03 –0,05 0,04 0,11 –0,18\n\nNão professe ideologia, menos céptica, crendo que 0,06 0,02 0,42 0,07 0,04 0,37 a participação pode valer\n\nProfesse ideologia, menos céptica, crendo que a 0,09 0,06 0,37 0,12 0,09 0,25 participação pode valer\n\nDiferença 0,03 0,04 –0,05 0,05 0,05 –0,12\n\nNota: A categoria «autarcas» foi omitida.\n\nreside agora nos 0,22 e a probabilidade de escolher os movimentos sociais de protesto sofre um aumento de 10 pontos, fixando-se nos 0,21, a categoria «não sabe» desce da sua posição anterior de categoria mais escolhida para a terceira posição, seguida dos partidos políticos e dos sindicatos, com 0,13 cada um, e da Igreja, com apenas 0,09. Porém, se a nossa «pessoa média», com o ensino secundário completo e não declarando qualquer ideologia, for também altamente céptica, crendo que a participação política não produz quaisquer efeitos, a probabilidade estimada de escolher a categoria «não sabe» é especialmente alta, de 0,45, seguida da escolha do Presidente, que é de 0,24. As alternativas remanescentes encontram-se muito próximas umas das outras, com os movimentos sociais atingindo uma probabilidade de 0,11, os sindicatos 0,09 e os partidos políticos 0,07. Por seu turno, a Igreja tem uma probabilidade mínima, de 0,03, de ser escolhida enquanto canal de expressão das preocupações para uma pessoa jovem com as características acima descritas. Se transformarmos essa pessoa jovem numa pessoa com ideologia, ainda continuamos com a categoria «não sabe» como categoria preferida, mas a probabilidade estimada desce 18 pontos, para 0,27. Uma vez que o nosso tipo-ideal é muito céptico relativamente à elite política, ainda que perfilhando uma ideologia, não surpreende que, desta feita, os movimentos sociais de protesto sejam o segundo canal de expressão preferido, com uma probabilidade estimada de 0,22, o que relega o Presidente para a terceira posição, com uma probabilidade de 0,19. As restantes alternativas apresentam mudanças muito pequenas, no que diz respeito à probabilidade de serem escolhidas. Isto é igualmente verdade quando nos voltamos para o nosso último tipo-ideal. Sendo que esta pessoa jovem média, com o ensino secundário completo, é menos céptica relativamente à elite política, mas acha que a participação pode valer a pena, não surpreende que o Presidente surja como o agente com maior probabilidade de ser escolhido (0,42), enquanto canal institucionalizado, embora alternativo aos partidos, de expressão de voz. Ainda assim, é de salientar que a categoria «não sabe» assume um peso quase igual, com 0,37. As restantes categorias têm todas uma probabilidade abaixo de 0,10 de serem escolhidas, com os sindicatos a atingirem o valor mais elevado, de 0,07. Estes resultados não saem do previsto, se tivermos em consideração que as pessoas que pertencem ao grupo dos «quem sabe» têm pouca confiança nas vantagens de estabelecerem contacto com um político, colaborarem com um partido político, ao mesmo tempo que consideram a participação em movimentos sociais de protesto extremamente ineficaz. O efeito da ideologia sobre o perfil\n\nMónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n112\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\ndo respondente não altera esta ordenação. Todavia, como anteriormente verificado, produz o seu impacto mais forte sobre a categoria dos «não sabe», reduzindo a probabilidade estimada para 0,25, o que resulta numa posição muito destacada para o Presidente, com 0,37 da probabilidade de ser escolhido como canal de ventilação ou de expressão pública das preocupações da população.\n\nNota conclusiva\n\nComeçámos este capítulo com duas questões fundamentais. Qual é a percepção dos cidadãos portugueses quanto ao desempenho, pelos partidos políticos, da sua função representativa, isto é, enquanto canais de expressão e realização das preocupações e interesses da sociedade no e através do Estado? Estarão os portugueses distanciados dos partidos enquanto canais de expressão política e, se sim, encontrarão outras instituições e agentes que confiram uma presença pública às suas preocupações? Chegados ao final deste estudo, estamos em condições de dizer que a resposta às questões colocadas é positiva, no primeiro caso, e negativa, no segundo: sim, os portugueses estão visivelmente afastados dos partidos enquanto canais de expressão política, e não, o recuo dos partidos, no exercício desta importante função, não está a ser suficientemente compensado por outras instituições, dentro ou fora do Estado. Mas, se este é o quadro geral que os dados do inquérito, tomados quase em bruto, nos revelam, o certo é que, quando trabalhados minuciosamente, por via de uma análise metódica, como a que neste capítulo foi desenvolvida, esses mesmos dados oferecem-nos um retrato bem mais definido dos portugueses na sua relação (ou não relação) com o sistema representativo nas suas dimensões formal e informal. Para que esse retrato fique completo deixamos aqui, em jeito de conclusão, alguns dos resultados mais interpelantes a que chegámos neste estudo exploratório sobre a dimensão subjectiva da representação no nosso país. Logo no início da nossa análise empírica explorámos a possibilidade da existência de uma relação entre a percepção dos cidadãos relativamente ao desempenho da função representativa pelos partidos e a ideologia. A análise de dados que efectuámos tornou claro que «sentir-se representado» por um partido político estava mais associado com a direita e o centro-direita do que com a esquerda e o centro-esquerda, sendo particularmente fraco ao «centro». Este resultado vai de encontro às suspeitas de que o «centrismo» do eleitorado português é menos uma questão de\n\n113\n\nconvicção do que um sinal da sua alienação, desafeição ou falta de interesse pela política. Uma imagem que sai, de resto, reforçada pela proximidade posteriormente detectada entre o «centro» e duas outras categorias centrais na análise aqui conduzida: a categoria dos que não têm partido e a categoria dos que não perfilham qualquer ideologia. Vimos também que aqueles respondentes que não declaram ideologia tendem a ser aqueles que maior dificuldade demonstram em encontrar, no sistema representativo, quer formal, quer informal, um canal de expressão razoavelmente satisfatório para as suas preocupações. Em contraste com estes, os que perfilham uma ideologia de esquerda e centro-esquerda tendem a encontrar expressão para as suas preocupações nos sindicatos e nos movimentos sociais de protesto, ao passo que a direita e o centro-direita fazem opções mais institucionais, privilegiando os partidos, o Presidente e a Igreja como canais de expressão da sua «voz». Por via da formação de agrupamentos de cidadãos de acordo com as suas atitudes perante a participação política e a responsividade do sistema político e seus agentes, conseguimos determinar que quem considera a participação política ineficaz tende a não encontrar qualquer canal de expressão política, dentro ou fora do sistema político formal, com o qual se identifique. Já quem acredita na eficácia da participação inclina-se para depositar as suas esperanças na participação eleitoral e na representação política tradicional, de matriz partidária, ao passo que aqueles que, não acreditando na eficácia da participação política, não a descartam totalmente, depositam as suas esperanças naquela presença que o Presidente ou os movimentos sociais de protesto saibam dar às preocupações da população no seu discurso e acção. Se, em termos das vantagens da participação política, encontrámos um leque diverso de atitudes, já no que respeita às percepções quanto à responsividade do sistema político e das elites aos interesses da população, o cepticismo detectado entre os inquiridos foi profundo e generalizado. Quando este cepticismo roça o total descrédito, é provável que nos encontremos também na companhia de indivíduos que ou se revêem na representação oferecida pelos movimentos sociais ou simplesmente não encontram qualquer representante, dentro ou fora do sistema político formal, para as suas preocupações e para aquilo que pensam sobre os mais importantes assuntos de interesse público. Os portugueses mais moderados no seu cepticismo relativamente à elite política e ao móbil da sua acção tendem já a encontrar «voz» em agentes e instituições formais, designadamente o Presidente e os partidos. Uma conclusão geral deste estudo é que os cidadãos necessitam de estar politizados, no sentido de perfilharem uma ideologia, para escolhe Mónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n114\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\nrem os movimentos sociais de protesto enquanto canais de expressão política. Neste sentido, as oportunidades de representação política fora do sistema eleitoral que estes movimentos oferecem falam sobretudo àqueles que, contestando esse sistema, estão politicamente socializados, encontram na ideologia uma forma de orientação política e demonstram alguma confiança nos efeitos da sua acção política. Também os sindicatos funcionam como um canal de expressão para as preocupações, e sobretudo para as objecções, de respondentes com um referencial ideológico determinado, que são cépticos quanto à responsividade do sistema político, mas que, ao contrário do que acontece com quem se revê no discurso e acção dos movimentos sociais, vêem a participação política, convencional e não convencional, como sendo, no geral, ineficaz na produção de qualquer mudança. Sendo que da nossa análise se conclui que é o Presidente da República quem mais empresta «voz» às preocupações dos portugueses, justifica-se um enquadramento do seu papel no sistema representativo, e tanto mais assim quanto o ónus da representação (que não a simbólica, da «unidade» e da «coesão», normalmente associada ao Presidente) é normalmente colocado no parlamento e no governo. A literatura mais recente sobre os princípios do governo representativo tem realçado o facto de devermos entender a representação menos em termos de uma relação entre principal e agente, como temos tradicionalmente feito, do que em termos das relações internas ao sistema representativo, entendido no seu todo (Mansbridge 2003; Garsten 2009; Disch 2011). Segundo os autores que defendem esta deslocação da nossa atenção para o sistema representativo, um dos principais propósitos do governo representativo é internamente «multiplicar e desafiar as reivindicações (claims) governamentais de representar o povo», assim provocando o debate sobre «o que a vontade popular é precisamente» e impedindo que uma interpretação dessa vontade se arrogue de «autoridade final» (Garsten 2009, 91). Este propósito tem por pressuposto a impossibilidade de o povo ser alguma vez representado totalmente: uma impossibilidade que alguns demagogos poderão tentar camuflar, alegando a sua perfeita identidade com o povo representado, mas que o governo representativo moderno põe a descoberto e visa preservar enquanto espaço necessário ao pluralismo democrático. Isso é conseguido pela multiplicação – embora controlada, para evitar bloqueios e dispersão de responsabilidades – dos agentes estatais que possam, com alguma plausibilidade, apresentarse como falando ou agindo em nome do povo. E que o façam também respondendo de forma diversa a uma e a mesma opinião pública.\n\n115\n\nUsualmente, esta representação diversa da opinião pública tem lugar no âmbito de um sistema apurado de freios e contrapesos que, pela institucionalização de uma pluralidade de poderes representativos, institucionaliza uma espécie de «soberania negativa», que recusa ceder à tentação, sempre presente, de conceder ao governo autoridade exclusiva para representar a voz popular (uma tentação que é, de resto, tanto maior quanto maior seja a dependência do parlamento face ao governo). Num sistema semipresidencialista, como o português, o Presidente da República é um forte candidato a esta função de representação alternativa ao governo da voz popular e das preocupações que a cada momento a informam. Directamente eleito pela população, o Presidente, cujo posicionamento é suprapartidário, desempenha importantes funções, quer fiscalizadoras, quer tribunícias. De facto, no estudo aqui realizado, o Presidente destaca-se enquanto válvula de segurança do sistema, isto é, como sendo aquele agente que mais contribui para a institucionalização da contestação social e, dessa forma, também para a sua canalização e o seu controlo. Isto acontece sobretudo no caso daqueles respondentes que, embora cépticos relativamente à responsividade do sistema e das elites que o conduzem, têm ainda uma réstia de esperança e, por isso, acreditam que a participação política, embora nem sempre consequente, pode, em determinadas circunstâncias, produzir efeitos e valer a pena. Sendo que o voto é destacado pelo portugueses como a forma mais eficaz de participação política, mas sendo arreigada a sua desconfiança relativamente à política partidária e seus actores, eleger directamente um presidente que controle o governo – isto é, que lhes empreste os seus «olhos» vigilantes dentro do aparelho de Estado e que conceda «voz» às suas preocupações e objecções, dentro e fora dele – é a forma que encontram para exercer alguma influência política. Todavia, para aqueles portugueses que se sentem perfeitamente alienados da política e do político – e são já muitos, a acreditar nos resultados que aqui apresentámos – o que prevalece é uma desorientação profunda no momento de escolher instituições ou agentes que, dentro ou fora do aparelho de Estado, canalizem as suas preocupações quando os partidos já não se mostrem capazes de o fazer. A um tempo insatisfeitos com a representação partidária e convictos da impossibilidade de alterarem a situação através de novas e velhas formas de participação política, estes portugueses tendem a abdicar simplesmente de «voz» e a optar pela saída. Se esta auto-exclusão continuará a ser silenciosa, ainda que, provavelmente, ressentida, ou se estes portugueses virão a encontrar «voz» em quem de futuro ofereça representação às suas preocupações, é uma per Mónica Brito Vieira e Nina Wiesehomeier\n\n116\n\nRepresentação em Portugal: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\ngunta sem resposta, no âmbito deste estudo. Mas uma desafeição tão profunda necessita seguramente de uma resposta política. E os partidos poderão bem ser a parte mais interessada em dá-la, antes que ela seja dada por eles e, possivelmente, também contra eles.\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nAarts, K., e J.

A importância dada a essa relação de vertical accountability (responsabilização vertical) entre representados e representantes vê-se de uma dupla forma. Por um lado, alguns académicos incorporaram a responsabilização na própria definição de democracia, entendida como «um sistema de governo no qual os governantes são responsabilizados pelas suas acções no domínio público pelos cidadãos» (Schmitter e Karl 1991, 76). Por outro lado, o tratamento empírico da qualidade da democracia requer como condição sine qua non a análise dessa dimensão de responsabilização como um dos seus princípios básicos. De tal forma que, como as análises recaem sobre democracias representativas, a responsabilização vertical (RV) «constitui uma verdadeira dimensão central pelo facto de fornecer aos cidadãos individuais e actores da sociedade civil os meios de controlo sobre os políticos e instituições políticas» (Diamond e Morlino 2005, XIII). Qualquer julgamento acerca do que constitui uma «boa democracia» tem de ter em conta os meios, e as condições, através dos quais os cidadãos controlam efectivamente, ou não, os governantes e as suas políticas. Ou seja, importa saber de que forma é que o ideal da RV (um dos elementos constitutivos da qualidade e da saúde da democracia representativa) tem correspondência na prática e se os desejos e expectativas dos cidadãos são preenchidos ou defraudados. Dentro desta perspectiva, este capítulo analisa as avaliações dos portugueses relativamente à dimensão da RV, as suas implicações, obstáculos e relação com dinâmicas políticas e sociais contemporâneas.\n\n121\n\nTipologia\n\nDe uma forma simples, enquanto a responsabilização horizontal (RH) se refere ao controlo que os poderes, agências e instituições do Estado exercem uns sobre os outros, a RV assenta no poder dos cidadãos, na sua capacidade de sujeitarem o poder público ao seu controlo, e o Estado à sociedade, levando-o à prestação de contas e à transparência nas decisões e políticas que afectam o bem comum. E existem dois tipos de RV. A primeira é eleitoral. Ou seja, os cidadãos exercem controlo através de eleições, livres, justas e regulares. Como afirma Dahl, «na ausência de eleições frequentes, os cidadãos perderiam um grau de controlo substancial sobre os seus eleitos» (1998, 96). A este exercício periódico de eleições pode acrescentar-se a via referendária, que, pelo menos do ponto de vista conceptual, ajuda a reforçar esta RV eleitoral. Mas existem outros mecanismos através dos quais esta RV, que vem de baixo, é efectuada pelo público. A actividade das organizações da sociedade civil, organizações não governamentais, grupos de pressão, media e movimentos sociais constituem o segundo tipo de RV: a RV social (v., por exemplo, O’Donnell 2002 e Peruzzotti e Smulovitz 2002). Este tipo de RV social pressupõe a existência de uma cidadania activa e empenhada, assim como de uma comunicação social livre e, tanto quanto possível, independente.\n\nResponsabilização vertical eleitoral: resultados\n\nO que é que a análise dos dados do inquérito à população portuguesa em Julho de 2011 nos revela? Em primeiro lugar, para o bom funcionamento da democracia, uma maioria muito expressiva (86%) considera que a realização de «eleições livres e justas» é «muito importante» ou «absolutamente essencial». E, em segundo lugar, uma maioria, embora já não tão expressiva (63%), considera que a liberdade de voto (livre de pressões) está assegurada. Partindo destes dados, e sabendo que a via eleitoral é um meio de excelência de compensação e de sanção dos governantes, poderíamos pressupor que para os portugueses essa tal responsabilização do poder político estaria minimamente garantida. Mas não é isso que o inquérito nos revela, confirmando, e até reforçando, a ideia já presente no relatório da Sedes de 2009 (Magalhães 2009, 3-4), de que a absoluta centralidade das eleições como critério de avaliação da qualidade da democracia pode, e deve, ser repensada. No sentido de\n\nJosé Pedro Zúquete\n\n122\n\nResponsabilização vertical\n\n123\n\nque a via eleitoral é necessária, mas não suficiente para a medição dessa qualidade. Atentemos no seguinte resultado: uma maioria significativa dos portugueses (74%) considera que «os decisores políticos são pouco responsabilizados pelas políticas que implementam». Para os inquiridos a inimputabilidade dos políticos adquire contornos de um verdadeiro axioma. Ela constitui um mal para o qual o voto popular é visto apenas e só como um paliativo, insuficiente. E esta ideia é reforçada pela descrença que perpassa do inquérito no que diz respeito ao sentido público do poder político. Veja-se como 78% dos inquiridos acham que, em vez do bem público, os seus representantes preocupam-se com o seu bem pessoal. Daqui ressalta uma sintonia entre as percepções dos portugueses no que diz respeito à RV eleitoral e ideias expressas na literatura sobre o tema. Particularmente a noção que «o controlo dos cidadãos sobre os políticos é, no melhor dos casos, altamente imperfeito na maioria das democracias. As eleições não são mecanismos suficientes para assegurar que os governantes farão tudo o que puderem para maximizar o bem-estar dos cidadãos» (Manin et al. 1999, 50). E, se neste ponto pode dizer-se que existe um consenso crescente, já no que se refere às razões pelas quais isso acontece as opiniões divergem. Se para alguns essa imperfeição do controlo por parte dos cidadãos, e que põe em causa o próprio conceito de responsabilização, é inerente à democracia (os cidadãos não possuem toda a informação e têm dificuldades naturais na avaliação dos governantes,1 como asseguram Cheibub e Przeworski 1999), para outros essa imperfeição depende, acima de tudo, dos contextos políticos e institucionais que limitam a capacidade dos eleitores de atribuírem uma responsabilidade clara e decisiva (Samuels e Hellwig 201, 410).\n\nResponsabilização vertical social: resultados\n\nA responsabilização não é preenchida pela eleição. Os portugueses querem mais mecanismos de responsabilização não eleitoral. E esta necessidade ganha ainda mais força porque uma esmagadora maioria, 86% dos inquiridos, acha que é «muito importante» ou «absolutamente essencial» «que se possa castigar os governos que governam mal e recompensar os que governam bem». É dentro desta perspectiva que se nota uma ní 1 Repare-se como 52% dos portugueses estão «de acordo» ou «muito de acordo» com a ideia de que «a política é um assunto demasiado complexo para uma pessoa como eu».\n\nJosé Pedro Zúquete\n\n124\n\ntida valorização de mecanismos de RV social. As iniciativas da sociedade civil e a comunicação social podem ajudar a cumprir aquilo que as eleições manifestamente, no entendimento dos cidadãos, são incapazes de cumprir isoladamente. Assim, maiorias expressivas querem (a) a suspensão imediata do mandato de um político acusado de corrupção (82%), (b) a revogação do mandato dos políticos por incompetência ou ilegalidades (80%), (c) maior controlo nas nomeações para a administração pública (79%) e nas decisões das autarquias e no governo central (76%), (d) finalmente, maior acesso das organizações não governamentais (70%) e da comunicação social (69%) às políticas governamentais. Esta manifesta necessidade, revelada pelo estudo, de apertar o controlo cidadão sobre o poder político tem subjacente uma dupla lógica. A primeira é a lógica da transparência, a rejeição absoluta da opacidade, quer no poder político, quer nas instituições políticas. Este crescente ênfase na transparência tem, inclusivamente, levado à crítica de que o que está em causa não é apenas e só limitar o poder político (como na tradição liberal), mas constrangê-lo de forma a transfigurá-lo. Assim, a «transparência, em vez da verdade ou do interesse geral, tornou-se a virtude mais importante num mundo incerto» (Rosanvallon 2008, 258). E, poderia acrescentar-se, essa procura da transparência sai reforçada num contexto de perda de confiança no sistema político que se manifesta também no desejo de saber e controlar mais. A segunda lógica que impera neste estudo é uma lógica de punição. A RV serve para recompensar ou castigar, mas os resultados do inquérito mostram-nos que a lógica que impera é a de crime e castigo. Tem sido argumentado que a responsabilização tem duas faces (Fox 2007), uma soft (a chamada answerability, em que os poderes respondem pelas suas acções, justificam-se) e uma hard (que inclui a answerability, mas também a possibilidade de sanções). No caso português, ou seja, nas expectativas e desejos dos cidadãos, pelo menos no que diz respeito a este estudo, o que predomina é a responsabilização hard. Esta lógica de punição, levada às suas consequências máximas, pode resultar no desejo de criminalização (no âmbito penal) dos políticos por actos de governação falhados, errados ou incompetentes. Nesse caso, más políticas passavam a ser crimes.2\n\n2 Para uma crítica desta possível consequência da lógica de punição, v. Almeida (2011).\n\nResponsabilização vertical\n\nObstáculos à responsabilização vertical social\n\nComo já foi dito, a optimização da RV social está directamente ligada aos níveis de ativismo da cidadania e da independência dos media. Se, de uma maneira geral, níveis significativos de portugueses acham «eficaz» ou «muito eficaz» participar em movimentos de cidadãos (40%) ou participar em associações (36%), predomina a descrença quanto à capacidade efectiva de estes agentes colectivos representarem politicamente os cidadãos (apenas 12% no caso dos movimentos sociais de protesto). Por outro lado, relativamente aos media, um número expressivo de portugueses considera que «para mudar as coisas em Portugal» o papel dos órgãos de comunicação social é «eficaz» ou «muito eficaz» (48%). Mas ao mesmo tempo a desconfiança quanto à independência desses mesmos media é grande, pois uma maioria clara (69%) considera que as pressões económicas e políticas influenciam a comunicação social em Portugal. Esta dupla desconfiança (quanto à capacidade de representação política dos movimentos de cidadãos e quanto ao carácter livre e independente da informação disponibilizada pelos media) condiciona o grau de RV social em Portugal. Por outro lado, e reflectindo o debate na literatura sobre a RV, a ausência de enforcement (ou seja, a ausência de capacidade de imposição e obrigação) por parte dos movimentos de cidadãos e dos media constitui um obstáculo à sua eficácia. A RH não sofre esta limitação (as instituições, como, por exemplo, o provedor de Justiça, o Presidente da República, a Assembleia da República, ou a União Europeia, têm capacidade, do ponto de vista formal, para controlar e sancionar as actividades governativas). É possível que a actividade desses agentes sociais (as suas avaliações, denúncias, ou protestos) leve a um maior controlo social sobre as políticas públicas e sobre a gestão dos recursos públicos, pressionando o Estado à prestação de contas, mas não detêm um mandato de sanção, do ponto de vista legal, para a possibilidade do incumprimento. A ausência de enforcement maximiza a importância da permeabilidade institucional às pressões da sociedade civil. Ou seja, a presença, ou não, de «pontos de entrada» nas agências de RH. É que a RV social «requer um mínimo de responsividade da parte do sistema institucional de controlos horizontais» (Peruzzotti 2011, 59). Alguns analistas vêem na «criatividade institucional» (ou seja, na criação de novas instituições independentes) uma forma de superar o deficit crónico de controlo do poder público. A instituição democrática tem de ser redesenhada (Manin et al. 1999, 50; v. também Grau 2003). Outros\n\n125\n\nainda defendem a instauração de mecanismos de responsabilização diagonal, em que os agentes da sociedade civil participam directamente nos processos e trabalhos das instituições de RH, o que supostamente levaria a uma maior confiança popular nessas instituições, aumentando ao mesmo tempo a capacidade de enforcement da própria sociedade civil (v., por exemplo, O’Brien e Stapenhurst 2008, 87-89). Por último, a RV social padece de um mal que para muitos analistas se tem agravado nas últimas décadas: a dificuldade (para não dizer impossibilidade) de descobrir e identificar a origem da responsabilidade (ou seja, a resposta à pergunta «quem fez o quê»), o que naturalmente afecta essa busca de transparência. Isto porque devido à aceleração multidimensional da globalização os governos nacionais estão cada vez mais enredados numa teia de múltiplos parceiros transnacionais que afectam a sua capacidade de soberania, desde organizações supranacionais, ONGs, multinacionais e mercados financeiros. Esta interconexão afecta não só o conceito de poder, como a capacidade de soberania do Estado-nação (entendida, do ponto de vista clássico, como autoridade e mandato sobre um determinado território) (v., por exemplo, Pierik 2004). Não se trata, claro, do fim do Estado-nação, mas da sua adaptação aos novos tempos. A existência desta rede transnacional, que o modificou, dificilmente poderá ser negada. E, se a ideia da responsabilização tem na base a identificação do responsável, a difusão e dispersão do poder decisório, que ultrapassa as fronteiras, torna essa tarefa mais problemática. E os portugueses parecem ter noção desta dificuldade de localização da responsabilidade. Veja-se como para uma maioria dos inquiridos (54%) os políticos portugueses não têm «autonomia para defender os interesses dos cidadãos nacionais», enquanto um número expressivo (41%) considera que os governos em Portugal têm pouca ou nenhuma «margem de manobra para decidir independentemente da vontade dos outros países».\n\nConclusão\n\nEste estudo de avaliação da qualidade da democracia em Portugal, no que diz respeito à RV, revela duas tendências claras dos portugueses quanto ao controlo do Estado pelos cidadãos: por um lado, a insuficiência das eleições como critério exclusivo de responsabilização do poder e instituições políticas; por outro lado, o desejo de implementação de medidas acrescidas de RV, nomeadamente pela sociedade. Não obstante os obstáculos ao fortalecimento do controlo social sobre o poder político,\n\nJosé Pedro Zúquete\n\n126\n\nResponsabilização vertical\n\n127\n\neles não parecem ser suficientes para ultrapassar o cepticismo da cidadania quanto à qualidade dos seus governantes e esmorecer a busca de vias alternativas de responsabilização. A incapacidade da democracia representativa (sentida e expressa pelos inquiridos) para responder às aspirações da população, assim como o desalento quanto à competência, independência e probidade da classe governante,3 podem levar ao fortalecimento de mecanismos não tradicionais de representação política, como os movimentos sociais, embora mesmo nesse campo, como foi salientado, as dúvidas quanto à eficácia dos mesmos sejam generalizadas. Acima de tudo, o que sobressai – e numa época de crise pode deduzir-se que esta tendência se fortalece – é o desejo popular de uma solução para que a impunidade no exercício de funções públicas, seja por corrupção, laxismo, ou manifesta incompetência, não seja sistemática e inerente ao próprio regime democrático.\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nAlmeida, S.

Responsabilização horizontal na democracia portuguesa\n\nIntrodução\n\nO governo é a instituição política mais importante no seio das democracias contemporâneas. Ele define a sua própria organização e funcionamento, estabelece e executa as linhas gerais das políticas do Estado e regula e controla a administração pública em todo o território nacional. Mas quem controla o governo? De que modo e em que medida essa vigilância se efectiva? E que percepções têm os cidadãos portugueses acerca deste processo? O presente capítulo procura respostas para estas questões e organiza-se em cinco secções. A primeira apresenta o conceito de responsabilização horizontal (RH)1 e discute-o à luz de contributos recentes. A segunda secção identifica os agentes com poderes para controlar as acções do governo no quadro da democracia portuguesa e descreve a sua configuração formal. A terceira secção parte de dados empíricos oficiais para observar, em perspectiva longitudinal, até que ponto os mecanismos de fiscalização e de sanção das acções do governo têm sido efectivamente utilizados. A quarta secção retrata as percepções dos cidadãos em relação a este fenómeno com base nos dados do inquérito do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» (2011). A última secção apresenta as conclusões.\n\nConceito\n\nO interesse empírico e teórico pelo fenómeno da RH começa a desenvolver-se no contexto de pós-transição democrática e no quadro dos\n\n* Os autores agradecem ao Cícero Pereira pelos seus comentários à análise dos dados. 1 Traduzido do original: horizontal accountability.\n\nestudos sobre a qualidade da democracia. À medida que a terceira vaga de democratização iniciada com a revolução de 25 de Abril de 1974 em Lisboa se vai espalhando, de forma duradoura, para outras regiões do mundo (Huntington 1991), torna-se necessário explicar por que determinadas democracias funcionam melhor do que outras (Diamond e Morlino 2004). Neste contexto, O’Donnell (1994) argumenta que, embora muitos dos regimes recém-democratizados cumpram requisitos mínimos de democracia (os governantes são eleitos em eleições concorrenciais, através do sufrágio universal e com garantia das liberdades de expressão e de participação), apresentam diferenças importantes entre si. Neste sentido, propõe distinguir entre democracias institucionalmente consolidadas e democracias incompletas ou «delegativas», com base num factor-chave: a presença (ou não) de poderes autónomos que controlam os governantes, principalmente entre uma eleição e outra. O’Donnell denominou este controlo interinstitucional horizontal accountability e diferenciou-o do clássico controlo vertical exercido pelos eleitores sobre os governantes através do voto.2 Não obstante a intensa proliferação de estudos sobre esta temática nas últimas duas décadas, o conceito de RH está longe de ser consensual. A literatura existente revela divergências em torno de pelo menos quatro pontos centrais, que influenciam a forma como a RH pode ser conceptualizada e empiricamente observada. A primeira questão controversa é «quem deve ser objeto de controlo». As posições variam de uma definição mais lata, segundo a qual todos os funcionários públicos – sejam políticos, funcionários públicos, juízes, forças policiais ou militares – devem ser controlados, para uma mais restrita, em que se consideram apenas os políticos – ministros, legisladores e líderes partidários (Schedler 1999, 22). A segunda questão é «o que deve ser controlado». De um lado estão os autores que incluem todas as actividades e condutas dos funcionários do Estado (Day e Klein 1987; Diamond et al. 1999; Fox e Brown 1998; Moncrieffe 1998; Paul 1992) e do outro lado aqueles que se focam em condutas específicas. O’Donnell (1999 e 2003) e Kenney (2003), por exemplo, consideram que apenas devem ser vigiadas as transgressões legais, como casos de corrupção e abusos de poder, enquanto outros autores incluem desvios de índole política, tais como o incumprimento de acordos programáticos ou de promessas eleitorais (Magaloni 2003; Moreno et al. 2003; Schedler 1999; Schmiter 1999;\n\nMarcelo Camerlo e Edalina Rodrigues Sanches\n\n130\n\n2 De acordo com O’Donnell, a RH significa: «the existence of state agencies that are legally enabled and empowered, and factually willing and able, to take actions that span from routine oversight to criminal sanctions».\n\nE quem controla o governo? Responsabilização horizontal na democracia portuguesa\n\n131\n\nWoodhouse 1994). A terceira questão é «como deve ser exercido o controlo». Há um consenso generalizado de que o controlo implica duas componentes: (i) capacidade de fiscalização, ou seja, o requisito ou a procura de informação acerca dos agentes controlados, estando estes últimos obrigados a responder; (ii) capacidade de sanção, ou seja, a penalização e/ou rectificação dos eventuais desvios verificados. No entanto, alguns autores entendem que só há efectivamente RH quando o actor que exerce o controlo pode impor sanções ao transgressor (Dunn 1999; Kenney 2003; Moreno et al. 2003), enquanto a maioria aceita a existência de certos agentes sem essa capacidade (Schedler 1999; O’Donnell 1999 e 2003). Neste contexto, Mainwaring (2003, 13) distingue a sanção directa (que pode ser aplicada pelo mesmo agente que faz a fiscalização) da sanção indirecta (quando o agente remete o exercício da sanção para outros agentes). O exemplo mais recorrente é o ombudsman, responsável por investigar condutas inadequadas dos funcionários do Estado, mas que deriva a função de penalização e rectificação para, por exemplo, a Assembleia da República. A quarta questão é «quem pode ou deve controlar». A concepção mais difundida é que o controlo deve ser exercido por instituições estatais claramente definidas, isto é, com competências e atribuições específicas e estabelecidas na lei. O principal atributo destes agentes é a autonomia, uma vez que se trata de agentes e instituições estatais que controlam outros agentes e instituições estatais. Contudo, existem abordagens que propõem alargar o elenco de agentes de RH em dois sentidos. Por um lado, incluindo instâncias não estatais, como a comunicação social, os sindicatos ou os movimentos sociais, uma vez que estes actores estão em condições tanto para denunciar como para sancionar os funcionários públicos (Schmitter 1999; Sklar 1999; Stark e Bruszt 1998), e, por outro lado, considerando as instâncias supranacionais que vigiam e denunciam as acções dos governos (Pastor 1999).3\n\nConfiguração formal\n\nNesta secção descrevemos a RH no sistema político português. No que diz respeito à conceptualização, adoptamos uma definição «híbrida», uma vez que é restrita quanto ao seu objecto – governo –, mas ampla quanto aos agentes que considera – estatais e não estatais. Relativamente à análise, utilizamos a Constituição da República Portuguesa (CRP) de 2005 para identificar os agentes de RH e caracterizá-los em função de quatro aspectos fundamentais: forma de controlo (fiscalização e/ou san 3 A Transparency International e a Human Rights Watch são alguns exemplos de instituições internacionais que vigiam e denunciam eventuais abusos de poder por parte dos Estados.\n\nMarcelo Camerlo e Edalina Rodrigues Sanches\n\n132\n\nção), dimensão de controlo (político e/ou legal), tipo de iniciativa (própria ou requerida) e tipo de sanção (directa ou indirecta). No quadro do semipresidencialismo português, o governo é fundamentalmente responsável perante o Presidente da República e a Assembleia da República (artigo 190.º). No entanto, um olhar mais detalhado permite identificar outros agentes com importantes poderes para vigiar e/ou sancionar o governo, tais com o provedor de Justiça, o Tribunal Constitucional, o Tribunal de Contas e o Ministério Público (v. quadro 5.1). A Assembleia da República é o órgão fiscalizador por excelência e a instituição com um elenco mais variado de instrumentos. Estes podem ser mobilizados pelos deputados, individualmente considerados (perguntas e requerimentos), ou ser desencadeados pelos grupos parlamentares (interpelações, moções e comissões parlamentares de inquérito). A Assembleia é um agente-chave de RH, uma vez que três dos seus instrumentos implicam a demissão do governo: (i) a rejeição do programa do governo; (ii) a não aprovação de uma moção de confiança; (iii) a aprovação de uma moção de censura por maioria absoluta dos deputados em efectividade de funções. Para além de exercer a fiscalização política, a Assembleia tem competência para vigiar o cumprimento da Constituição (um décimo dos deputados pode solicitar a fiscalização abstracta da constitucionalidade e da legalidade das normas ao Tribunal Constitucional), assim como para tomar as contas do Estado, após parecer do Tribunal de Contas e demais elementos necessários à sua apreciação. Por sua vez, o Presidente da República tem poderes de nomeação e de demissão do governo e amplas competências de fiscalização política da actividade legislativa. O Presidente pode suscitar ao Tribunal Constitucional a fiscalização (preventiva, abstracta e por omissão) da constitucionalidade dos diplomas que recebe para promulgação ou pode vetá-los, isto é, devolvê-los, sem os promulgar, ao órgão que os aprovou. O veto político é absoluto no caso dos diplomas do governo, mas relativo no caso dos diplomas da Assembleia, sendo, portanto, passível de ser ultrapassado por uma fracção maioritária dos deputados. Tal como a Assembleia, o Presidente tem iniciativa própria e mecanismos de sanção directa do governo. A figura do Provedor de Justiça foi introduzida em Portugal no seguimento do 25 de Abril de 1974 com a missão de proteger os cidadãos de eventuais abusos de poder por parte das instituições estatais, entre as quais o governo.4 O seu titular actua por iniciativa própria ou a partir\n\n4 O Provedor tem um mandato de quatro anos e é eleito pela Assembleia da República, a quem deve enviar anualmente um relatório de actividades.

Num primeiro momento, ouve as entidades visadas nas queixas, solicita informações, realiza inquéritos e faz observações, podendo efectuar visitas de inspecção sem aviso prévio a qualquer sector da administração central. Num segundo momento, o Provedor pode fazer recomendações aos órgãos competentes com vista à correcção de actos ilegais ou injustos ou à melhoria dos respectivos serviços. Estas recomendações não são de carácter vinculativo, mas as entidades públicas têm o «dever jurídico» de cooperar. Se se verificar uma recusa de colaboração, o Provedor pode dirigir-se à Assembleia da República. O Provedor tem ainda competência para requerer a fiscalização da constitucionalidade (abstracta e por omissão) ao Tribunal Constitucional.5\n\nO Tribunal Constitucional, órgão de soberania e responsável máximo pela administração da justiça, fiscaliza a conformidade das normas jurídicas com a Constituição. Esta fiscalização é basicamente de quatro tipos – preventiva, abstracta, concreta e por omissão 6 –e , salvo algumas excepções (artigo 281.º, n.º 3), deve ser requerida por outros agentes de RH. As suas decisões são vinculativas, mas veiculadas através de outros agentes, principalmente o Presidente da República e a Assembleia da República. O Tribunal de Contas é o órgão supremo de fiscalização e julgamento da legalidade das despesas públicas e colabora com a Assembleia da República no processo de controlo das contas do Estado [artigo 162.º, d)]. Os relatórios intercalares sobre a execução do Orçamento do Estado, bem como o relatório e parecer sobre a Conta Geral do Estado, têm como destinatário o parlamento, que tem o poder para aprovar o Orçamento do Estado. O tribunal tem essencialmente uma função de fiscali promover os direitos, liberdades, garantias e interesses legítimos dos cidadãos, assegurando, através de meios informais, a justiça e a legalidade do exercício dos poderes públicos (artigo 23.º). Desde 1996, o Provedor de Justiça também pode intervir nas relações entre particulares, mas somente quando exista uma relação especial de domínio e se esteja no âmbito da protecção de direitos, liberdades e garantias (artigo 2.º, n.º 2, do Estatuto). 5 O relatório está disponível em http://www.provedor-jus.pt/relatoriosan.php. 6 A fiscalização preventiva efectua-se antes de os diplomas serem publicados e, no caso dos decretos-leis do governo, quem a requer é o Presidente da Republica. A fiscalização abstracta dirige-se a qualquer norma do ordenamento jurídico, independentemente da sua aplicação concreta, e pode ser requerida pelo Presidente da República, pelos membros da Assembleia da República, pelo provedor de Justiça, entre outros. A fiscalização concreta ocorre a propósito das normas de aplicação concreta e cabe, em primeira linha, ao tribunal perante o qual o caso se encontra pendente. Contudo, cabe recurso para o Tribunal Constitucional para cidadãos particulares e o Ministério Público. A fiscalização por omissão verifica o não cumprimento, por omissão, de medidas legislativas necessárias e só pode ser desencadeada pelo Presidente da República ou pelo provedor de Justiça.\n\nE quem controla o governo? Responsabilização horizontal na democracia portuguesa\n\nzação, pode apresentar recomendações ao governo, mas estas são desencadeadas pela Assembleia da República. O Ministério Público é um órgão cuja competência é essencialmente legal, uma vez que pode requerer a fiscalização da constitucionalidade de diplomas do governo. Existem ainda dois agentes que estão fora do âmbito estatal e que merecem ser destacados, nomeadamente a União Europeia (UE), cada vez mais importante para o processo de elaboração e execução das políticas públicas nacionais, e os meios de comunicação social, que nas actuais sociedades democráticas, são verdadeiros watch dogs das acções dos governos. Na CRP encontramos poucas referências relativamente aos instrumentos de controlo dos agentes não estatais. No que diz respeito à comunicação social, a CRP apenas faz menção à liberdade de imprensa e aos direitos de antena; relativamente à UE, existe uma disposição específica sobre a obrigação do governo de informar a Assembleia sobre as questões europeias [artigo 197.º, i)]. Para além disso, a Assembleia inclui a Comissão de Assuntos Europeus, que é um órgão especificamente concebido para acompanhar e monitorizar as iniciativas europeias e que conta com a colaboração das respectivas comissões parlamentares permanentes. A figura 5.1 sintetiza as dinâmicas de relações ente os agentes de RH. As setas pretas indicam que o agente de RH tem capacidades para fiscalizar e sancionar; as setas cinzentas tracejadas indicam que o agente apenas tem capacidade de fiscalizar; as setas pretas e pontuadas indicam a\n\n135\n\nFigura 5.1 – Processo formal da responsabilização horizontal\n\nFonte: Elaboração própria.\n\nGoverno\n\nUnião Europeia\n\nAssembleia da República Presidente da República\n\nTribunal Constitucional\n\nTribunal de Contas\n\nMinistério Público\n\nProvedor de Justiça Media\n\nMarcelo Camerlo e Edalina Rodrigues Sanches\n\n136\n\nactivação de instrumentos de fiscalização ou sanção por parte de outros agentes.\n\nDesempenhos efectivos dos principais agentes\n\nNa secção anterior apresentámos os agentes de RH e as suas competências de fiscalização e sanção do governo, tal como surgem definidas na CRP. Agora analisamos os desempenhos concretos dos quatro agentes estatais mais importantes, nomeadamente a Assembleia da República, o Presidente da República, o Provedor de Justiça e o Tribunal Constitucional, e no final descrevemos a actuação dos agentes não estatais – meios de comunicação social e UE –, recorrendo a estudos sobre o caso português.\n\nAssembleia da República\n\nEm termos longitudinais, verifica-se que as figuras jurídicas que apenas envolvem a fiscalização – nomeadamente a apreciação dos decretos-leis, as interpelações e os requerimentos – têm vindo a crescer de forma consistente no seio das actividades parlamentares, enquanto as figuras jurídicas que podem acarretar uma eventual sanção do governo ou de um membro do governo – comissões e inquéritos parlamentares e moções – são utilizadas de modo mais irregular, embora a tendência seja, no global, descendente (quadro 5.2). No que diz respeito às moções, os instrumentos mais relevantes e influentes da Assembleia da República, verifica-se que as moções de censura estão presentes em todas as legislaturas, com excepção da VII (governo minoritário de PS), enquanto as moções de confiança e de rejeição do programa do governo são mais esporádicas. Na VI Legislatura os grupos parlamentares (GP) do PS7 e do PCP apresentaram moções de rejeição do programa do XII Governo Constitucional de Cavaco Silva; na VIII Legislatura os GP do PSD e do BE apresentaram moções de rejeição do programa apresentado pelo governo minoritário liderado por António Guterres; na IX Legislatura todos os GP, com excepção do CDS-PP, apresentaram moções de rejeição do programa do governo. Ainda na IX Legislatura, os primeiros-ministros Durão Barroso\n\n7 PS: Partido Socialista; PCP: Partido Comunista Português, PSD: Partido Social-Democrata, BE: Bloco de Esquerda; CDS-PP: Centro Democrático Social-Partido Popular.\n\nE quem controla o governo? Responsabilização horizontal na democracia portuguesa\n\n(2002-2004) e Pedro Santana Lopes (2004-2005) apresentaram moções de confiança à Assembleia da República, como forma de consolidarem o apoio parlamentar. Em ambos os casos, as moções foram aprovadas com os votos dos grupos parlamentares do PSD e do CDS-PP. Embora as moções constituam um dos poderes mais importantes de punição do governo, não têm provocado a demissão do governo. Em parte, isto acontece devido à capacidade que os sucessivos governos tiveram, ainda que em posição minoritária, para negociar com os partidos da oposição, mas existem outros factores importantes. Na análise do parlamento português de 1983-1995, Leston-Bandeira (2002, 129) considera que, por exemplo, a ausência de moções na VII Legislatura (governo minoritário do PS) pode ser indicativa de que os actores políticos interiorizaram o valor da estabilidade política. Não obstante, o número de moções efectuadas na VIII e sobretudo na IX Legislatura sugere que outras variáveis poderão estar em causa, nomeadamente a maior fragmentação do sistema partidário a partir de 1999. No que diz respeito aos inquéritos/comissões parlamentares, a VI Legislatura (governo maioritário liderado por Cavaco Silva) destaca-se no período de análise com um total de 8 inquéritos parlamentares e 3 comissões de inquérito iniciadas.\n\nPresidente da República\n\nComo referimos anteriormente, o Presidente da República pode demitir o governo, o que acarreta a dissolução do parlamento e, consequentemente, a realização de eleições antecipadas. No período em análise, a Assembleia foi dissolvida três vezes: na VIII, na IX e na XI Legislaturas.\n\n137\n\nQuadro 5.2 – Controlo do governo pela Assembleia da República (1991-2011)\n\nVI Leg.

Fonte: Elaboração própria a partir de dados disponíveis no sítio da Assembleia da República (www.parlamento.pt).\n\nNa VIII Legislatura a Assembleia foi dissolvida por Jorge Sampaio, na sequência do pedido de demissão de António Guterres. Esta decisão foi precipitada pelo resultado das eleições autárquicas de Dezembro de 2001, em que o PS sofreu uma derrota significativa. Em 2004, já no âmbito do seu 2.º mandato, Jorge Sampaio volta a dissolver a Assembleia, depois de várias demissões de ministros e remodelações no interior do governo liderado por Santana Lopes. Esta dissolução distingue-se das restantes, uma vez que não é desencadeada pelo primeiro-ministro; muito pelo contrário, a posição de Santana Lopes é de desacordo relativamente à decisão do presidente Jorge Sampaio. Finalmente, na XI Legislatura, Cavaco Silva dissolve o parlamento após aceitar o pedido de demissão apresentado por José Sócrates, que considerou que o seu governo não tinha condições políticas para se manter em funções face à recusa dos partidos da oposição em aprovarem o pacote de medidas previsto no Programa de Estabilidade e Crescimento IV. No quadro 5.3 apresentamos a frequência com que o Presidente exerceu os seus poderes de fiscalização e de veto. Os valores mais altos registam-se nos segundos mandatos de Mário Soares e de Jorge Sampaio. O segundo mandato de Mário Soares desenrolou-se no contexto de uma maioria parlamentar do PSD, liderada por Cavaco Silva. A situação de coabitação, assim como o facto de não haver horizonte de reeleição para Mário Soares, poderão ter conduzido a um maior uso dos poderes de fiscalização (30 vezes). Entre 1996 e 2001 as relações entre Jorge Sampaio e o governo minoritário liderado por António Guterres foram de convergência. Com efeito, o facto de existir uma convergência de cor política entre a maioria parlamentar e o presidente eleito poderá ter-se traduzido num desempenho mais cerimonial por parte do Presidente. No seu segundo mandato, Jorge Sampaio coabita com um governo de direita (coligação do PSD com o CDS-PP), liderado, primeiro, por\n\nMarcelo Camerlo e Edalina Rodrigues Sanches\n\n138\n\nQuadro 5.3 – Controlo do governo pelo Presidente da República (1991-2011)\n\nPresidente Pedidos de fiscalização Pedidos de fiscalização (mandato) preventiva da sucessiva da Vetos políticos constitucionalidade constitucionalidade\n\nLei Decreto-lei Lei Decreto-lei Lei Decreto-lei Total\n\nSoares (1991-1996) 14 9 2 1 7 23 56 Sampaio (1996-2001) 3 4 0 0 4 8 19 Sampaio (2001-2006) 7 0 1 0 8 55 71 Cavaco Silva (2006-2011) 10 0 2 0 14 1 15\n\nFonte: Adaptado de Freire e Pinto (2005, 87).

A situação de instabilidade política levou a que o Presidente fosse mais interventivo, utilizando 63 vezes os seus poderes de veto. Finalmente, entre 2006 e 2011 Cavaco Silva vetou 15 diplomas, dos quais 14 tiveram origem na Assembleia (alguns dos exemplos mais mediáticos são a lei das uniões de facto, a lei do financiamento partidário, o Estatuto Político-Administrativo dos Açores, a lei da paridade e a lei do divórcio) e apenas um no governo (o diploma vetado visava simplificar o procedimento de mudança de sexo e de nome próprio no registo civil).\n\nProvedor de Justiça\n\nO primeiro provedor português toma posse em Março de 1976 e inicia funções regulares a partir de Outubro com uma equipa de 15 pessoas. Até final deste primeiro ano são registadas 1583 queixas. Ao longo do tempo, o número de queixas tem crescido consistentemente, totalizando 6505 processos em 2010. Ainda que nem todos os processos sejam tratados no mesmo ano em que são abertos, a taxa média de resolução é alta (mais de 80%) e tem aumentado ligeiramente, em termos longitudinais. A percentagem de queixas que não são tratadas, quer devido à aplicação de medidas liminares, quer por falta de fundamento, é geralmente alta, mas tem vindo a baixar (de 54% durante a década de 90 para 46% na década seguinte).8 Em relação à resolução das queixas, verifica-se uma taxa de execução mais ou menos estável, em torno dos 25%. A administração central (incluindo todos os ministérios) tem sido a instituição mais visada, recolhendo entre 50% e 60% do total de queixas recebidas (outras instituições visadas são entidades particulares e estrangeiras, a administração indirecta e autónoma, as administrações regionais dos Açores e da Madeira, a administração local e as entidades independentes). Dentro da administração central existem cinco ministérios que recebem mais de 80 % das queixas: Trabalho e Segurança Social, Finanças, Administração Interna, Justiça e Educação. Os dados que apresentamos no quadro 5.4 indicam o número de processos abertos (por queixas apresentadas e por iniciativa do Provedor), a percentagem de queixas dirigidas à administração central e as acções do Provedor (recomendações e requerimentos de fiscalização ao Tribunal Constitucional).\n\n139\n\n8 Relatório 2010, 33, disponível em http://www.provedor-jus.pt/restrito/pub_ficheiros/Relatorio_AR_2010.pdf.\n\nTribunal Constitucional\n\nOs procedimentos de fiscalização concreta constituem a maior parte dos acórdãos (86%) proferidos pelo Tribunal Constitucional desde 1983, data da sua criação. A sua evolução foi vertiginosa nos primeiros treze anos, chegando a um pico de 1145 acórdãos em 1996 (coincidente com o último ano do governo de Cavaco Silva e o primeiro do Guterres). Desde essa data o número de acórdãos por ano desceu atingindo uma média de 480 acórdãos anuais. A figura 5.2 mostra os valores médios para os quatro tipos de fiscalização que se destinam ao governo. A evolução da fiscalização abstracta tem sido pouco linear, com uma média de 16 acórdãos por ano (apenas 3% do total da actividade do Tribunal Constitucional). É durante os governos de Cavaco Silva, de Durão Barroso e de Santana Lopes que encontramos uma maior frequência destes acórdãos, sendo a sua expressão mais reduzida no governo de Guterres (figura 5.3). Curiosamente, os procedimentos de fiscalização preventiva apresentam uma dinâmica similar, embora a média de acórdãos por ano seja inferior (média = 4). Segundo Santos (2011, 99), os picos ascendentes e descendentes de mobilização destes instrumentos devem-se a momentos de conflitualidade político-institucional, nomeadamente a reeleição de Mário Soares para a Presidência da República e a coabitação com Cavaco Silva e o pedido de demissão do primeiro-ministro António Guterres. Por último, a fiscalização por omissão representa menos de 0,1% do total de acórdãos do Tribunal Constitucional (equivalente a 8 acórdãos em 29 anos).

O número de estudos acerca da relação entre os meios de comunicação social e a política em Portugal tem vindo a crescer nos últimos anos. Estes estudos, predominantemente centrados nos media tradicionais, têm fornecido resultados e pistas importantes sobre os efeitos dos media na definição da agenda política 9 e nos comportamentos eleitorais.10 Não obstante, «fica por contar a história» sobre a forma como os meios de comunicação social têm intervindo no processo de responsabilização do governo. Um olhar atento sobre a imprensa nacional diária apresenta-nos vários exemplos do papel dos media na dinâmica de RH. De seguida apresentamos três dos casos mais mediáticos. O primeiro é o «caso Magalhães»: a 7 de Março de 2009 o semanário Expresso noticia que, pelo menos, 80 erros foram encontrados nas instruções dos jogos educativos do computador Magalhães. Esta notícia despoletou uma reacção imediata do Ministério da Educação, que no mesmo dia solicita «a remoção do software». Além disso, a investigação conduzida pelo Expresso desencadeou mecanismos de RH, uma vez que no dia 17 de Março a ministra Maria de Lurdes Rodrigues foi ao parlamento, a pedido do GP do PSD, para explicar o processo de escolha das empresas envolvidas na produção e integração de conteúdos no computador.11 O segundo caso diz respeito à «compra da TVI». Na sequência de notícias sobre um alegado plano\n\nMarcelo Camerlo e Edalina Rodrigues Sanches\n\n142\n\n9 V., por exemplo, José Santana Pereira (2008) e Traquina (1995). 10 Entre muitos, destacamos os trabalhos de Paula Espírito Santo (2006) sobre os slogans das eleições presidenciais portuguesas entre 1976 e 2006, de Susana Salgado (2007 e 2009), primeiro, sobre a cobertura noticiosa das legislativas de 1999 e, depois, sobre as legislativas de 2005 e as presidenciais de 2006, de Eduardo Cintra Torres (2009) sobre o efeito dos debates presidências no comportamento eleitoral e de José Santana Pereira sobre os factores de exposição dos cidadãos aos meios de comunicação social. 11 «Magalhães tem tantos erros que ‘è’ difícil ‘contar-los’» e «Programa vai ser retirado do Magalhães» (Expresso, edição on-line, 7 de Março de 2009); «Ministra vai ao parlamento explicar erros do Magalhães» (Expresso, edição on-line, 10 de Março de 2009).\n\nE quem controla o governo? Responsabilização horizontal na democracia portuguesa\n\n143\n\ndo governo para controlar a comunicação social que incluiria a compra de parte da TVI pela PT, o BE avança com a proposta de criação de uma comissão de inquérito, que recolhe mais tarde o apoio dos outros partidos políticos. O terceiro exemplo é o caso «face oculta». A jornalista Felícia Cabrita, jornalista do Sol, foi responsável pelas notícias relacionadas com este caso e foi ainda ouvida na Comissão de Ética do parlamento, onde acusou o PS de «ataque salazarista» ao semanário Sol e deixou também claro que o governo, já desde os tempos do caso «Freeport», tentou abalar a sustentabilidade financeira do jornal.12 Estes e outros exemplos demonstram que os media desempenham um papel fundamental na democracia portuguesa; têm iniciativa para denunciar eventuais actos ilegais cometidos pelos governos e desencadeiam mecanismos de RH de outros agentes (neste caso, a Assembleia da República). Olhando agora para a UE, referimos anteriormente que as suas acções de controlo são mediadas pela Assembleia, mais especificamente pela Comissão de Assuntos Europeus, em funcionamento desde 1985. Na prática, as formas de controlo têm referências claras (por exemplo, os critérios sobre pactos fiscais) que assumem a forma de «compromissos externos» (Dyson e Featherstone 1996). Estes compromissos funcionam em dois sentidos, sendo que, por um lado, condicionam o processo decisório do governo nacional e, por outro, permitem aos governos desenvolver estratégias para desculpar a implementação de políticas impopulares (Weaver 1986). Em Portugal, esta estratégia tem sido amplamente utilizada pelos partidos dos governo (PS e PSD), como, aliás, demonstra Jalali (2012). Apesar de os estudos sobre a relação entre os governos e a UE serem numerosos, ainda dispomos de poucas análises sobre as modalidades substantivas de controlo europeu sobre o governo português (Jalali 2012; Lobo 2005).\n\nPercepções dos cidadãos\n\nCom base nos dados do inquérito do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia», descrevemos de seguida a forma como os cidadãos portugueses observam o fenómeno da RH (figura 5.3).13 Em primeiro lugar,\n\n12 «Felícia Cabrita acusa PS de ‘ataque salazarista’ ao jornal Sol» (TSF, 19 de Fevereiro de 2010). «Sol publica novos dados sobre alegado plano do Governo». 13 O inquérito inclui três perguntas sobre a RH: a primeira tem a ver com os atributos gerais da democracia e pergunta até que ponto é importante «[...] que haja outras instituições do Estado que vigiem a actuação dos governos»; a segunda é sobre as capacidades de controlo que estas instituições deviam ter: «Das seguintes instituições, diga-me, por\n\nMarcelo Camerlo e Edalina Rodrigues Sanches\n\n144\n\nQuadro 5.5 – Análise factorial (rotação oblíqua)\n\nLoadings\n\nO Provedor de Justiça 0,690 O Presidente da República 0,676 A Assembleia da República 0,748 Os meios de comunicação social 0,608 A União Europeia 0,628\n\nVariância explicada 45%\n\nFigura 5.4 – Capacidades desejáveis e efectivas dos agentes de responsabilização horizontal\n\nFonte: Elaboração própria com base nos dados do inquérito do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia».\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nPresidente da República\n\nAssembleia da República\n\nUnião Europeia\n\nProvedor de Justiça\n\nComunicação social\n\nNS/NR\n\nDevia ter Tem\n\n35\n\n52\n\n15\n\n38\n\n12\n\n39\n\n11\n\n28\n\n5\n\n28 29\n\n14\n\nfavor, qual delas acha que devia ter um papel maior em travar possíveis abusos de poder por parte dos governos em Portugal» (escolha única); a terceira é sobre a capacidade que os inquiridos atribuem a estas instituições: «E, para cada uma delas, em que medida acha que as seguintes instituições têm realmente capacidade para travar possíveis abusos de poder por parte dos governos: total capacidade, bastante, alguma, pouca ou nenhuma capacidade?»\n\nE quem controla o governo? Responsabilização horizontal na democracia portuguesa\n\nde uma perspectiva global, os resultados indicam que para mais de 80% dos inquiridos a existência de outras instituições do Estado que vigiem a actuação dos governos é «muito importante» (41%) ou mesmo «absolutamente essencial» (40%) numa democracia. No que diz respeito às capacidades desejáveis ou percepcionadas como reais dos agentes de RH, a figura do Presidente da República é a que recebe as melhores avaliações. De facto, a maioria dos inquiridos (52%) considera que o Presidente tem bastante ou total capacidade para travar eventuais abusos por parte do governo e 35% entendem que o Presidente deveria ter mais capacidade de controlo. A Assembleia da República e a UE são colocadas num segundo patamar, com valores praticamente idênticos, no que se refere às capacidades efectivas (38% e 39%, respectivamente) e desejáveis (15% e 12%, respectivamente). Finalmente, o Provedor de Justiça e os meios de comunicação social são os agentes que, de acordo com os inquiridos, têm menos capacidade para fiscalizar as acções dos governos (28% e 26%, respectivamente) e os que também deveriam ter menos capacidade para o fazer (11,2% e 4,9%, respectivamente). Vale a pena salientar a percentagem considerável de inquiridos (superior a 14%) que se enquadram na categoria «não sabe/não responde» nas duas questões. No início deste capítulo referimos que a nossa conceptualização de RH era ampla, na medida em que incluía agentes estatais e não estatais.\n\n145\n\nQuadro 5.6 – Descrição dos clusters\n\nVariáveis Cluster N Média\n\nProvedor de Justiça 1 437 1,65 2 532 2,43 Total 969 2,08\n\nPresidente da República 1 437 2,20 2 532 3,00 Total 969 2,64\n\nAssembleia da República 1 437 1,69 2 532 2,89 Total 969 2,35\n\nMeios de comunicação social 1 437 1,34 2 532 2,34 Total 969 1,89\n\nUnião Europeia 1 437 1,64 2 532 3,00 Total 969 2,38\n\nNota: Antes de conduzir a análise de cluster as variáveis originais foram recodificadas numa escala de 0 a 4, fazendo coincidir os valores mais altos com maior capacidade de controlo.\n\nMarcelo Camerlo e Edalina Rodrigues Sanches\n\n146\n\nNo entanto, será que os inquiridos consideram que todos os agentes que contemplámos na nossa definição teórica formam um único eixo de RH ou será que atribuem outras competências a estes agentes, que não a de RH? A análise factorial apresentada no quadro 5.5 indica que a resposta a esta pergunta é positiva, uma vez que os inquiridos percepcionam o conjunto de seis agentes acima descritos de um modo unidimensional, agrupando-os numa única componente. Face a este resultado, a etapa seguinte é a de perceber até que ponto existem diferenças na forma com os inquiridos avaliam cada um dos agentes de RH. Os resultados da análise de clusters (quadro 5.6) demonstram, claramente, que existem dois grupos de inquiridos: uns mais «pessimistas» (cluster 1), que atribuem sistematicamente menor capacidade de controlo a todos os agentes de RH (a média das avaliações varia entre 1,6 e 2,2), e outros mais «optimistas» (cluster 2), que, pelo contrário, tendem a ser mais positivos nas suas avaliações (a média das avaliações varia entre 2,3 e 3,0). Tendo em conta a existência destes dois grupos, coloca-se então a questão de perceber que perfis sociais e políticos os caracterizam. Neste sentido, seleccionámos um conjunto de dez variáveis independentes que utilizámos numa análise de regressão logística para avaliar o seu impacto na probabilidade de os indivíduos efectuarem percepções positivas.14 Os resultados demonstram que o conjunto de variáveis presentes nos dois modelos explica apenas uma pequena fracção da probabilidade de os indivíduos atribuírem maior capacidade de controlo aos agentes de RH (6,6% no modelo 1 e 13,0% no modelo 2). Apesar de a percentagem explicada não ser muito expressiva, ambos os modelos são estatisticamente significativos. No modelo 1, apenas a região e a situação na profissão têm efeito estatisticamente significativo, sendo a relação com a variável dependente positiva. Mais concretamente, verifica-se que a probabilidade de ser atri 14 A variável dependente é dicotómica (1 = probabilidade de os indivíduos terem percepções positivas e 0 = probabilidade de terem percepções negativas). As dez variáveis preditoras são: sexo («masculino = 1» e «feminino = 0»); idade (medida em anos); grau de escolaridade («ensino secundário, médio ou universitário = 1 e «todos os outros graus de ensino = 0»); região (variáveis dummy para Norte Litoral, Grande Porto, Interior, Centro Litoral e Grande Lisboa, sendo o Sul – que agrega o Alentejo e o Algarve – a categoria de referência); católico («católico = 1» e «todas as outras religiões = 0»; situação na profissão («empregado por conta de outrem = 1» e «outras situações = 0»); ideologia («esquerda = 1» e «direita = 10»); identificação partidária («sim = 1» e «não = 0»); exposição aos media («muito exposto = 4» e «pouco exposto = 0», construída com base nas seguintes perguntas – com que frequência... (a) lê a secção de política num jornal, (b) vê notícias sobre política na televisão, (c) ouve notícias sobre política na rádio e (d) utiliza a internet para obter notícias ou informação política) e, finalmente, avaliação do funcionamento da democracia («1= muito pior» e «muito melhor = 4»).\n\nE quem controla o governo? Responsabilização horizontal na democracia portuguesa\n\n147\n\nbuída maior capacidade de controlo aos agentes de RH aumenta entre os inquiridos do Grande Porto, do Centro Litoral e entre os empregados por contra de outrem, quando comparados com os inquiridos residentes na zona sul do país (Algarve e Alentejo) e que se encontram noutra situação profissional. Quando controlamos variáveis de natureza política, os efeitos da região (Grande Porto) e da situação na profissão mantêm-se significativos, mas surgem outros preditores importantes. A ideologia, a identificação partidária e a satisfação com o funcionamento da democracia predizem de modo estatisticamente significativo e em sentido positivo o facto de os inquiridos atribuírem maior capacidade de controlo aos agentes de RH. Os indivíduos identificados com um partido político, mais próximos da direita e mais satisfeitos com o modo como a democracia funciona estão mais inclinados a fazer avaliações positivas. Estes resultados são interessantes na medida em que sugerem várias coisas. Em primeiro lugar, as variáveis sócio-demográficas estruturais, como o sexo, a idade e a escolaridade, são pouco relevantes para explicar e prever a avaliação que os cidadãos fazem do sistema de RH. Deste grupo apenas a situação na profissão constitui um preditor importante. Em segundo lugar, existem diferenças significativas a nível subnacional na forma como os cidadãos percepcionam a política.

Embora não tenhamos analisado este resultado com mais pormenor no âmbito deste capítulo, ele constitui uma pista de investigação futura importante. Em terceiro lugar, as variáveis de natureza política – ideologia, identificação partidária e satisfação com a democracia – que estão associadas a outros fenómenos políticos, como o comportamento eleitoral, influenciam de igual modo as percepções que os cidadãos formam acerca da RH. Assim, as percepções dos cidadãos sobre o sistema político parecem estar sobretudo ancoradas em factores sociais e identitários.\n\nConclusões\n\nAo longo deste capítulo estudámos o fenómeno da RHna democracia portuguesa em torno de três grandes questões. Em primeiro lugar, quem controla o governo? Através da CRP de 2005 identificámos os vários agentes que compõem o sistema de RH e vimos que (i) são dotados de diferentes instrumentos de controlo (fiscalização e/ou sanção), (ii) têm maior ou menor iniciativa para controlar e sancionar o governo e (iii) exercem o controlo sobre diversos domínios da acção do governo (políticos, legais, financeiros). Porém, ainda que a dinâmica de RH apresente uma configuração sistémica, há um agente que se destaca sobre os restantes: a Assembleia da República. A Assembleia surge dotada não só do maior elenco de poderes próprios, como de fortes capacidades para moderar o desempenho de outros agentes (tribunais, meios de comunicação social, UE e Provedor). Neste sentido, um governo que tenha maioria parlamentar fica menos exposto aos instrumentos de fiscalização e sanção políticas de outros agentes de RH. Em segundo lugar, até que ponto estes agentes controlam efectivamente o governo português? Os dados empíricos oficiais que apresentámos indicam níveis de desempenho importantes para todos os agentes, mas com desenvolvimentos diferentes ao longo do tempo. No caso dos quatro agentes estatais mais importantes – Presidente da República, Assembleia da Republica, Provedor de Justiça e Tribunal Constitucional – observámos que a frequência de activação dos instrumentos de fiscalização e/ou sanção do governo varia em função dos diferentes contextos político-institucionais.\n\nE quem controla o governo? Responsabilização horizontal na democracia portuguesa\n\n149\n\nCom feito, o tipo de suporte legislativo do governo ou a correspondência de «cor política» entre o primeiro-ministro e o Presidente da República e entre este último e a maioria na Assembleia parecem ser condicionantes importantes. Assim, vimos, por exemplo, que nos segundos mandatos de Mário Soares e de Jorge Sampaio, em que houve coabitação com os governos de direita, existiu um uso mais frequente dos poderes presidenciais do que nas ocasiões em que houve coincidência no parlamento e na presidência. Olhando agora para os actores não estatais – os meios de comunicação social e a União Europeia –, embora existam poucos estudos sobre o caso português, verificámos que eles são muito relevantes e que devem ser tidos em conta no sistema de RH, uma vez que realizam um controlo efectivo sobre as acções do governo, nomeadamente no que diz respeito à implementação e execução das políticas públicas. Finalmente, que percepções têm os cidadãos do processo de RH? Em primeiro lugar, os cidadãos consideram que todos os agentes que incluímos na nossa definição de RH, estatais ou não, fazem parte de um mesmo sistema que é responsável por vigiar as acções do governo. Em segundo lugar, no que diz respeito às avaliações que os inquiridos fazem acerca das capacidades reais e desejáveis de cada um dos agentes de RH, os resultados demonstram que o Presidente é a instituição em quem os cidadãos mais confiam e ainda aquela que gostariam de ver dotada de mais poderes para travar eventuais abusos de poder por parte do governo. Não obstante este padrão, a nossa análise também demonstrou que as percepções dos inquiridos sobre a RH perfilam dois grupos: de um lado estão os que têm uma visão mais positiva e do outro os que têm uma visão mais negativa acerca dos agentes de RH. Finalmente, através da análise de regressão verificámos que a região de origem, a situação na profissão, a identificação partidária, a ideologia esquerda/direita e a satisfação com o funcionamento da democracia influenciam de modo significativo as avaliações dos inquiridos.\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nDay, P., e R.

Uma das dimensões cruciais que estão presentes em quase todas as abordagens é a a dimensão relativa aos direitos e liberdades sociais e políticos dos cidadãos. Esta dimensão representa uma das condições mínimas para a existência de regimes democráticos e um dos seus princípios constitucionais. É sobre esta dimensão que o presente capítulo se centra. No âmbito deste capítulo, seguimos a abordagem teórica e metodológica de Larry Diamond e Leonardo Morlino (2005, XI). Segundo estes autores, a qualidade da democracia deve ser avaliada em três parâmetros: nos seus procedimentos (procedure quality) – já que a qualidade de um dado produto é o resultado de um processo que obedece a métodos e timings precisos e rigorosos –, no seu conteúdo (content quality) – uma vez que a qualidade de um produto resulta das suas características estruturais, tais como a sua configuração, os materiais que o compõem ou o seu modo de funcionamento – e, por fim, nos seus resultados (result quality) – que podem ser directamente observáveis através do grau de satisfação do cliente (o cidadão), independentemente da forma como o produto em causa é produzido e do seu conteúdo específico (2005, XI). É de salientar o papel preponderante que Diamond e Morlino atribuem aos direitos e liberdades dos cidadãos, que no âmbito dos significados atrás mencionados correspondem à qualidade da democracia em\n\n153\n\nEkaterina Gorbunova e Filipa Raimundo\n\n154\n\ntermos do conteúdo, ou, dito de outra forma, à dimensão substantiva da qualidade da democracia. De acordo com Morlino (2009, 16-17), a liberdade refere-se a todo o conjunto de direitos e liberdades dos cidadãos numa democracia. A liberdade garante não só a dignidade do homem, mas também os direitos civis e políticos, que devem ser iguais para todos. Assim, a liberdade pode ser vista como consistindo em três tipos de direitos individuais: direitos políticos, direitos civis e direitos sociais (ou sócio-económicos) (Morlino 2009; Diamond e Morlino 2004). Ao longo do presente capítulo serão analisados vários indicadores de direitos e liberdades, dando especial relevância aos dados gerados pelo «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» (BQD) do ICS, que, em 2011, recolheu dados de opinião pública sobre a qualidade da democracia junto da população portuguesa. Os dados de opinião pública produzidos pelo BQD sobre a protecção dos direitos e liberdades revestem-se de um interesse especial, já que essa é uma das dimensões da qualidade da democracia que mais impacta directamente sobre os cidadãos, ao contrário de dimensões como a responsabilização (accountability), que é mediada por instituições políticas. Uma vez que o BQD mede apenas a percepção dos cidadãos portugueses num dado momento (2011), complementámos a análise recorrendo a outros instrumentos que fornecem dados comparativos sobre direitos e liberdades civis em Portugal e na Europa ao longo dos últimos vinte anos. O instrumento mais utilizado ao longo deste capítulo foi o «Democracy Barometer», que foi recentemente criado para avaliar a qualidade da democracia em vários países do mundo (cf. Bühlmann et al. 2007). O «Democracy Barometer» mede a qualidade das democracias através de um índice composto por três dimensões: liberdades, controlo e igualdade. Estas dimensões dizem respeito a princípios democráticos que são mutuamente necessários e em alguns casos interdependentes, sendo que a cada um corresponde um conjunto de indicadores. A dimensão «liberdades», aqui analisada, é composta por três indicadores: liberdades individuais, Estado de direito e esfera pública.1 Uma vez que o\n\n1 Os autores do estudo Democracy Barometer consideram que os direitos políticos são funções de igualdade numa democracia e não de liberdade. Ao longo deste capítulo falaremos em direitos sociais e políticos como indicadores de liberdade, uma vez que incluímos o direito ao sufrágio (artigo 48.º da Constituição Portuguesa) na lista de direitos e liberdades analisados. No entanto, na sua maioria, os direitos e liberdades aqui mencionados integram a secção «Direitos, liberdades e garantias pessoais» da Constituição da República Portuguesa, como ficará claro na terceira secção deste capítulo.\n\nDireitos e liberdades e qualidade da democracia em Portugal\n\n155\n\ncapítulo 1 do presente livro se centra exclusivamente sobre os aspectos relacionados com o Estado de direito, a nossa análise incidiu apenas sobre as liberdades individuais e a esfera pública. Apesar das várias críticas que lhe têm sido apontadas, não poderíamos deixar de recorrer também à Freedom House (FH).2 A FH criou em 1972 um índice de liberdades que tem sido sucessivamente melhorado e aplicado a todos os Estados independentes do mundo. Actualmente, este índice é construído a partir de 25 questões, que se dividem em 10 questões sobre «liberdades políticas» e 15 questões sobre «direitos civis». A dimensão «liberdades políticas» é construída a partir de três indicadores: processo eleitoral, pluralismo e participação política e funcionamento do governo. A dimensão «direitos civis» é construída a partir de quatro indicadores: direito de associação, Estado de direito, autonomia individual e liberdade de expressão e de crença. Uma vez que a FH não fornece dados em bruto, recorremos apenas aos seus relatórios descritivos. Sempre que se verificou pertinente, adicionámos àquela descrição a informação contida nos relatórios do Departamento de Estado norte-americano sobre Portugal publicados entre 2000 e 2008.3\n\nPor último, foram também utilizados dados do European Values Study (EVS), nomeadamente os que dizem respeito à satisfação com a democracia. O EVS, criado em 1981, é um projecto global e longitudinal de investigação que explora os valores, crenças, atitudes e opiniões dos cidadãos europeus, abordando temas como a vida, a família, o trabalho, a religião, a política e a sociedade. A quarta vaga, que decorreu em 2008, abrangeu 47 países da Europa, o que corresponde, no total, a cerca de 70 000 inquiridos. Utilizando todos estes instrumentos, foi possível comparar os dados de opinião pública com as regras formais, a prática e o estado da qualidade da democracia em Portugal e no resto da Europa. É importante salientar que, enquanto aqueles instrumentos («Democracy Barometer» e Freedom House) utilizam indicadores baseados em regras formais e dados sobre o cumprimento legal e a aplicação prática dos princípios base da democracia, o BQD é o único instrumento que introduz dados de opinião pública que nos permitem aferir qual a percepção dos cidadãos nacionais sobre aqueles direitos e liberdades.\n\n2 As autoras tiveram em conta as críticas frequentemente apontadas por especialistas de regimes políticos e da democracia (Munck e Verkuilen 2002; Schmitter e Schneider 2004) 3 U.S. Department of State Human Rights Reports, disponível em http://www. state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt. Consultado em 20-10-2012.\n\nO capítulo está estruturado da seguinte forma. A secção «A qualidade e a satisfação com a democracia: Portugal no contexto europeu» apresenta tendências gerais acerca da qualidade e da satisfação com a democracia em Portugal e no resto da Europa entre 1990 e 2008 – uma análise comparada e longitudinal que serviu de inspiração para a estrutura do capítulo. A secção «Direitos e liberdades civis: entre o reconhecimento formal e a opinião pública» analisa os direitos sociais e políticos em Portugal, na regra e na prática. Nesta secção analisa-se de que forma é que a Constituição da República Portuguesa contempla os direitos e liberdades utilizados pelo BQD e exploram-se alguns dados gerados pela FH e pelo «Democracy Barometer», onde a Constituição é analisada conjuntamente com relatórios de especialistas (expert judgements), assim como outras fontes sobre a aplicação prática daqueles princípios constitucionais. Esta triangulação permitiu-nos fazer uma análise mais detalhada da protecção dos direitos e liberdades políticos e sociais em Portugal. A secção «O que pensam os portugueses» centra-se essencialmente nos dados do BQD, nomeadamente nos dados de opinião pública sobre as garantias dos direitos e liberdades fundamentais em Portugal, analisando o impacto que estas atitudes têm na avaliação da qualidade da democracia. Finalmente, as conclusões apresentam uma síntese do capítulo, fazendo uma articulação entre a qualidade da democracia, a satisfação com a democracia e a percepção dos portugueses sobre as garantias de direitos e liberdades em Portugal. Antes de avançarmos com a análise dos dados sobre a qualidade da democracia em Portugal faremos uma breve análise da qualidade das democracias europeias ao longo dos últimos anos no contexto da União Europeia (UE). Usando os dados do projecto «Democracy Barometer», podemos construir gráficos que nos permitem ter uma ideia do lugar relativo que Portugal ocupa entre alguns dos países da UE. Na ausência de dados longitudinais para os 27 Estados membros, optámos por apresentar os dados disponíveis, agrupando os países em quatro regiões. Assim, o grupo a que chamámos «Europa mediterrânica» inclui Portugal, a Espanha, a Itália, Chipre e Malta (não existem dados para a Grécia); o grupo «Europa ocidental» inclui a Alemanha, a Áustria, a Bélgica, a França, a Holanda, a Irlanda, o Luxemburgo, o Reino Unido e a Suíça; o grupo «Europa do Norte» inclui a Dinamarca, a Islândia, a Finlândia, a Noruega e a Suécia; finalmente, o «grupo Visegrado» inclui o grupo histórico, onde se integram a Polónia, a República Checa e a Hungria (não existem dados para a Eslováquia).\n\nEkaterina Gorbunova e Filipa Raimundo\n\n156\n\nDireitos e liberdades e qualidade da democracia em Portugal\n\nQualidade e satisfação com a democracia: Portugal no contexto europeu\n\nA qualidade das democracias europeias\n\nA figura 6.1 sugere que a qualidade da democracia nos países em análise traçou um percurso ligeiramente ascendente entre 1990 e 2007, ainda que com períodos de recuo. Ao longo do período analisado, os valores situaram-se sempre acima dos 50%, com excepção do grupo Visegrado, durante o período 1990-1991, que corresponde ao início da sua transição para a democracia. Em segundo lugar, o quadro revela que Portugal se assemelha à Espanha, o que pode estar relacionado com o facto de que ambas as democracias nasceram nos anos 70 e fizeram a adesão à UE em 1986, imediatamente antes do período analisado no quadro. Em terceiro lugar, a leitura do quadro sugere que durante os anos em análise os dois países ibéricos se aproximaram mais da média da Europa ocidental do que da média da Europa mediterrânea. De salientar ainda que os países que se democratizaram na sequência da queda do muro de Berlim (neste\n\n157\n\nFigura 6.1 – Qualidade da democracia na Europa (1990-2007)\n\nNota: Portugal e a Espanha estão contemplados no grupo «Europa mediterrânica», assim como a Alemanha está contemplada no grupo «Europa ocidental».

Os autores do projecto «Democracy Barometer» consideram que «este salto qualitativo pode ser explicado pela rápida passagem dos regimes socialistas a regimes democráticos» (Bühlmann 2011, 22). Esta mudança pode ser explicada, em particular, por uma melhoria significativa do princípio de liberdade (em termos de liberdades individuais, Estado de direito, ou da opinião pública). Após estas rápidas mudanças, a qualidade da democracia nesta região cresceu de forma muito mais reduzida. Finalmente, é de salientar o contraste entre a qualidade da democracia nos países da Europa do Norte e nas restantes regiões europeias. Quando analisamos apenas os dados relativos à dimensão «liberdades» (deixando, portanto, de parte a dimensão «controlo» e a dimensão «igualdade») (figura 6.2), a leitura é um pouco diferente. Em primeiro lugar, com excepção da Europa do Norte, as linhas de tendência apresentam-se todas com sentido ligeiramente descendente, ao contrário do que sucedia no quadro anterior. Em segundo lugar, comparativamente com o índice da qualidade da democracia, os valores relativos às «liber Ekaterina Gorbunova e Filipa Raimundo\n\n158\n\nFigura 6.2 – Qualidade da democracia na Europa: liberdades (1990-2007)\n\nNota: Portugal e a Espanha estão contemplados no grupo «Europa mediterrânica», assim como a Alemanha está contemplada no grupo «Europa ocidental».

Estes dados sugerem que as democracias representadas em ambos os quadros asseguram melhores medidas de «controlo» e «igualdade» (que são as outras duas dimensões usadas pelo «Democracy Barometer» para medir a qualidade da democracia) do que de «liberdades», com excepção do grupo Visegrado. Por último, ao nível das «liberdades», Portugal aproxima-se mais da média da Europa mediterrânica do que no cômputo geral da qualidade da democracia, enquanto o seu país vizinho, a Espanha, apresenta os piores resultados entre as regiões e países representados. Veremos em seguida de que forma é que os cidadãos destes países valorizam ou não a democracia como sistema político preferencial e quão satisfeitos se têm revelado com o desempenho desse mesmo sistema ao longo dos últimos anos.\n\nSatisfação com as democracias europeias\n\nO século XX testemunhou o surgimento da ideia de democracia como valor universal e com ele desenvolveu-se também uma área central da ciência política como disciplina autónoma (Lijphart 1977; Sartori 1987; Dahl 1989). Hoje em dia a democracia não é apenas o melhor regime político, é também um valor partilhado pela maioria das pessoas no mundo (incluindo as populações dos regimes não democráticos).4 De acordo com o EVS, entre os anos de 1999 e 2009, a esmagadora maioria da população da Europa considerou que «ter um sistema político democrático» era «bastante bom» ou «muito bom» (como demostra a figura 6.3). No entanto, se, de acordo com os dados do EVS de 2008, 93% dos portugueses consideravam a democracia um sistema muito bom ou bom, a actual crise económica e social parece ter afectado esta percepção de uma maneira bastante negativa. No inquérito realizado em Julho de 2011 pelo BQD, apenas 56% dos inquiridos consideram que a democracia é preferível a qualquer outra forma de governo (v. a figura 6.4). É importante sublinhar que nesta avaliação geral da importância da democracia uma parte significativa da população (15%) está a favor da existência de um governo autoritário, em algumas circunstâncias. Este resultado, que não desafia necessariamente a viabilidade da democracia enquanto forma de\n\n159\n\n4 A afirmação de um valor universal implica que as pessoas em qualquer lugar do mundo podem ter razão em ver a democracia como valor (Sen 1999).\n\ngoverno em Portugal, parece estar directamente relacionado com o nível de insatisfação dos cidadãos com o desempenho do regime actual e, como consequência, com um desencanto com a democracia como sistema político. De acordo com vários autores (Easton 1975; Klingemann 1999; Linz 1995; Norris 1999 e 2011), o nível de satisfação dos cidadãos com o desempenho democrático dos governos é um dos indicadores mais importantes de apoio público ao regime, bem como um factor de consolidação da democracia e da sua estabilidade.5 Na verdade, as pessoas podem expressar atitudes negativas em relação aos elementos específicos do funcionamento do sistema político, por exemplo, o desempenho dos partidos políticos, dos líderes governamentais ou dos membros do parlamento, mas sem questionar a existência e legitimidade do regime. Em Estados democráticos as eleições permitem mudanças regulares, o que permite ao\n\nEkaterina Gorbunova e Filipa Raimundo\n\n160\n\nFigura 6.3 – Apoio à democracia na Europa (1999-2008)\n\nNota: Percentagens de pessoas que consideram que ter um sistema político democrático é muito bom/bastante bom.

Contudo, segundo Pippa Norris, «se o público perder a confiança na qualidade da democracia, isso poderá ter consequências muito maiores para a estabilidade do regime» (Norris 2011, 89). Juan Linz também defende uma ideia similar: o nível de apoio dos cidadãos ao regime pode vir a ser uma reserva-chave durante as crises que cada democracia enfrenta ao longo da sua história (Linz 1995). Por outro lado, autores como David Easton têm demonstrado que as atitudes dos cidadãos em relação às instituições e regimes políticos devem ser vistas não apenas como causas, mas também como consequências do funcionamento das mesmas. O modelo input-output que David Easton desenvolve com base na análise de sistemas utiliza três variáveis principais: exigências (demands), apoios (supports) e respostas (feedback) (Easton 1965, 38). As pessoas, enquanto actores, expressam a sua opinião (demands) sobre o sistema político e o seu funcionamento, que deve servir os interesses específicos dos cidadãos. As respostas correspondem aos resultados (outputs) de um sistema político, que são decisões e acções de líderes do sistema, tomadas na base de alocação de valores. O ciclo de realimentação do sistema (feedback loop) tem um significado crucial para a sua capacidade de lidar com o stress e de persistir (Easton 1965, 209).6\n\n161\n\nFigura 6.4 – Preferência da democracia como forma de governo em Portugal\n\nNota: Percentagens de pessoas.

A satisfação com o funcionamento da democracia é geralmente reconhecida como um dos principais indicadores de apoio público às instituições democráticas (cf. Norris 2011).7 Utilizando a classificação de David Easton (1975), este indicador pode ser localizado entre o nível máximo de apoio difuso (ou seja, no apoio aos princípios básicos da democracia) e o máximo de apoio específico (ou seja, no apoio ao regime político do país). Os dados do EVS deixam perceber o declínio do apoio à democracia na Europa em 2008-2009 quando comparados com a década precedente. É de salientar o resultado de Portugal, que passou do país mais satisfeito com o funcionamento da sua democracia em 1999 (79% dos portugueses\n\n7 Para uma discussão mais aprofundada sobre questões de medida associadas ao conceito de satisfação com a democracia, v.

Os dados do BQD de 2011 confirmam esta tendência decrescente: actualmente, a insatisfação com a democracia ascende a 65% dos inquiridos, ou seja, em 2011, 65% dos portugueses consideravam-se pouco satisfeitos ou nada satisfeitos com a maneira como a democracia funciona em Portugal (v. a figura 6.6). Além disso, quase metade da população adulta estava convencida de que, actualmente, a democracia em Portugal funciona pior ou muito pior do que há cinco anos. Mas o que pode explicar esta crescente insatisfação com a democracia na Europa, em geral, e em Portugal, em particular? Haverá alguma correlação entre uma menor satisfação com a democracia e a degradação dos direitos e liberdades? Antes de explorarmos esta questão vejamos em detalhe que direitos e liberdades são estes e como é que eles têm evoluído ao longo dos anos.\n\nDireitos e liberdades civis: entre o reconhecimento formal e a opinião pública\n\nA comunidade internacional estabeleceu um padrão de protecção dos direitos e liberdades individuais.

Desde a assinatura da Declaração Universal dos Direitos Humanos da ONU, em 1948, a profundidade com que estes direitos têm sido estudados e monitorizados pela comunidade internacional cresceu de forma exponencial (Landman 2004, 907). Existem também vários sistemas para a promoção e protecção dos direitos individuais ao nível regional, incluindo os espaços europeu, interamericano e africano. A Carta dos Direitos Fundamentais da União Europeia8 (adoptada em Dezembro de 2010) especifica claramente todos os aspectos da dignidade humana, liberdade, igualdade, solidariedade, cidadania e justiça, que se referem à dimensão substantiva da qualidade da democracia. Para além disso, todos os direitos e liberdades mencionados são normalmente inseridos nas constituições dos países (especialmente países considerados democracias consolidadas). No caso português, os direitos à vida, à integridade pessoal, à identidade pessoal, à cidadania, à liberdade e à segurança, ao processo criminal, à presunção de inocência, à inviolabilidade do domicílio e da correspondência, à família, ao casamento e à filiação, de deslocação e de emigração, de reunião e de manifestação, tal como as liberdades de expressão e informação, de imprensa e meios de comunicação social, de consciência, de religião e de culto, de aprender e ensinar, de associação, de escolha de profissão e acesso à função pública, entre outros, estão consagrados nos artigos 24.º-47.º do capítulo I, «Direitos, liberdades e garantias pessoais», do título II da Constituição da República Portuguesa (7.ª revisão constitucional, 2005).9\n\nO capítulo II do mesmo título (artigos 48.º-52.º) é dedicado especificamente aos direitos, liberdades e garantias de participação política e o capítulo III (artigos 53.º-57.º) aos direitos, liberdades e garantias dos trabalhadores (ou seja, aos direitos e liberdades sociais, na nossa terminologia). Por sua vez, o capítulo I do título III (artigos 58.º-79.º) abrange os direitos económicos, sociais e culturais, como os direitos ao trabalho, dos trabalhadores e consumidores, à iniciativa privada, cooperativa e autogestionária, de propriedade privada, à segurança social e solidariedade, à saúde, à habitação e urbanismo, ao ambiente e à qualidade de vida, à família, direitos das crianças, jovens, cidadãos portadores de deficiência e cidadãos da terceira idade, direitos à educação, à fruição e criação cultural, à cultura física e desporto, entre outros.\n\n8 «Carta dos Direitos Fundamentais da União Europeia», Jornal Oficial das Comunidades Europeias, C364/1, 18-12-2000. 9 Disponível em http://www.parlamento.pt/Legislacao/Paginas/ConstituicaoRepublicaPortuguesa.aspx. Consultado em 20-10-2012.\n\nDireitos e liberdades e qualidade da democracia em Portugal\n\nParece inquestionável que os principais direitos e liberdades individuas estão formalmente reconhecidos em Portugal. No entanto, apesar do crescimento e proliferação de instrumentos jurídicos para a protecção dos direitos e liberdades individuais, mesmo as democracias consolidadas, como Portugal, podem revelar uma disparidade entre a proclamação oficial e a implementação efectiva. De facto, os estudos produzidos na década de 90 sugeriam que Portugal estava longe de ser um caso exemplar no que dizia respeito aos direitos de cidadania (Benavente et al. 1997). Os abusos por parte do Estado e a passividade por parte dos cidadãos eram então vistos como os principais motivos para a reduzida qualidade da democracia portuguesa. Ao teorizar sobre as razões pelas quais algumas democracias asseguram um maior respeito por estes direitos e liberdades considerados essenciais, Morlino (2012) alerta para o facto de o maior problema residir no custo que muitos deles representam para a comunidade, especialmente os sociais. Esta interpretação remete não só para uma avaliação dos recursos do Estado, mas também da ideologia predominante, no que diz respeito ao papel do Estado na sociedade. Morlino (2012, 214) sugere ainda que, ao nível das liberdades, uma democracia sem qualidade é uma democracia em que (a) há uma proliferação do reconhecimento formal dos direitos sem preocupação com a sua implementação e (b) existe reconhecimento dos direitos sociais sem atribuição de subsídios. Assim, para avaliar se os direitos e liberdades individuais estão assegurados na prática no caso português procedemos à triangulação dos relatórios sobre direitos políticos e liberdade civis da FH, juntamente com os dados produzidos pelo «Democracy Barometer» – ambos com base em regras formais e dados objectivos – e os dados produzidos no âmbito do BQD em 2011. A primeira ideia a reter é que a análise da FH sobre os direitos e liberdades sociais e políticos em Portugal é, no essencial, consistente com os dados de opinião pública recolhidos pelo BQD, como teremos oportunidade de verificar na secção «O que pensam os portugueses». Por outras palavras, as liberdades que, de acordo com os relatórios da FH, se encontram mais fortemente consagradas nas leis e na prática são também aquelas que os inquiridos consideram estarem mais garantidas. Em primeiro lugar, as liberdades que são melhor avaliadas são a liberdade de voto, a liberdade de religião e a liberdade de associação em Portugal. No caso da liberdade de voto, há a destacar pela positiva a alteração introduzida vinte anos depois da Constituição de 1976, que atribuiu o direito de voto e elegibilidade nas eleições autárquicas aos imigrantes oriundos\n\n165\n\nde países não pertencentes ao espaço europeu. Esta lei caracteriza-se por assentar no princípio da reciprocidade, que implica que o país de origem conceda o mesmo direito aos imigrantes portugueses. Importa, contudo, referir que este direito havia já sido concedido a cidadãos de países de língua oficial portuguesa mesmo antes de 1996. Entre os países lusófonos, Cabo Verde e o Brasil foram os únicos a aprovar o princípio da reciprocidade, permitindo assim que os cidadãos cabo-verdianos e brasileiros residentes em Portugal pudessem usufruir do direito de voto nas eleições autárquicas antes de esse direito ter sido reconhecido aos restantes imigrantes (Zobel e Barbosa 2011). Apesar daquelas mudanças positivas – e seguindo a sugestão de Diamond e Morlino (2005) –, uma análise mais aprofundada sobre o direito de voto em Portugal poderia levar a uma interpretação diferente. Como sugere o estudo de Paulo Trigo Pereira (2008), analisando o número de partidos que compõem o sistema partidário português, a dimensão média do círculo eleitoral e os índices de proporcionalidade, poder-se-á dizer que o direito de voto em Portugal não está tão garantido quanto seria desejável, já que os eleitores não podem personalizar o voto nas eleições legislativas. Ou seja, se essa alteração fosse introduzida, Portugal poderia subir no índice da qualidade da democracia. No caso da liberdade de religião, houve também evoluções positivas no âmbito legal desde a transição para a democracia, a começar pela aprovação da lei da liberdade religiosa, em 2001, e, mais tarde, com a regulamentação da assistência religiosa nas Forças Armadas, em hospitais e outros estabelecimentos do Serviço Nacional de Saúde e em estabelecimentos prisionais (introduzida por decreto-lei em 2009). A aprovação da lei da liberdade religiosa é tida como um marco importante que consagra, por exemplo, o direito aos funcionários públicos de, a seu pedido, suspenderem o trabalho no dia de descanso semanal, nos dias das festividades e nos períodos horários que lhes sejam prescritos pela confissão que professam (ainda que mediante o cumprimento de alguns requisitos definidos pela lei). Na sequência da aprovação daquela lei, foi também criada a Comissão da Liberdade Religiosa, que funciona como órgão independente do parlamento e do governo, cujo objectivo é garantir a protecção daquele direito legal.10\n\nFinalmente, quanto à liberdade de associação, a leitura dos relatórios da FH indica que não tem havido quaisquer obstáculos que prejudiquem\n\nEkaterina Gorbunova e Filipa Raimundo\n\n166\n\n10 O sítio da Comissão da Liberdade Religiosa: http://www.clr.mj.pt/sections/home, consultado em 20-10-2012.\n\nDireitos e liberdades e qualidade da democracia em Portugal\n\n167\n\na qualidade da democracia. A lei permite a livre criação de associações, desde que estas não sejam de natureza militar, não tenham por fim incitar à violência e não assentem numa ideologia fascista. Outra excepção à lei são as associações internacionais, que, ao contrário das restantes, necessitam de autorização do governo. Os restantes direitos/liberdades contemplados no inquérito do BQD foram avaliados de forma menos positiva pelos inquiridos, como veremos adiante, e parece haver algum fundamento para essa percepção. Relativamente à liberdade de pensamento e expressão, os relatórios da FH revelam que algumas organizações de direitos humanos têm denunciado falhas no tempo de resposta a queixas, assim como na investigação, denúncias essas referidas pelo Departamento de Estado norte-americano em 2004 e replicadas pela FH em 2005. Ainda assim, seria de esperar uma avaliação um pouco mais positiva, visto não haver nenhuma referência a casos específicos ou a situações que possam pôr em causa a qualidade da democracia. Os relatórios da FH fazem ainda referência a denúncias feitas por diversos grupos de protecção dos direitos humanos em relação a essa matéria, o que sugere que o direito a não sofrer abusos policiais poderá não estar tão garantido quanto seria desejável.11 O «Democracy Barometer» faz alusão a acontecimentos específicos que terão justificado críticas e recomendações por parte do Conselho da Europa.12 Também o Departamento de Estado norte-americano refere o abuso da força por parte das forças policiais naquela década. Por fim, os relatórios da FH mencionam o facto de a constituição garantir o direito à não discriminação, assim como o facto de a polícia não usar de força excessiva e uma preocupação por parte do Estado em combater a discriminação, nomeadamente através da aprovação de legislação específica e da criação de instrumentos para promover a integração. No entanto, parecem existir relatos de situações de discriminação que, com o passar dos anos, parecem não ter sido eliminadas. Mais ainda, no relatório de 2008 é feita alusão à taxação de impostos considerados discriminatórios e a protestos nas ruas contra medidas governamentais consideradas racistas, o que parece sugerir que o direito a não ser discriminado poderá também não estar suficientemente garantido.\n\n11 V. também o relatório da Amnistia Internacional em http://www.amnistia-internacional.pt/files/relatorioanual/RA_2012/Portugal_2012.pdf, consultado em 20-102012. 12 Os exemplos mencionados nos relatórios remontam, concretamente, a 1995 (o caso Duarte Teives) e a 2000 (o caso Álvaro Rosa Cardoso).\n\nA figura 6.7 apresenta a evolução das liberdades individuais e esfera pública que constituem a dimensão «liberdades» do índice de qualidade da democracia em Portugal entre 1990 e 2007.33\n\nEsta figura sugere, essencialmente, dois aspectos: por um lado, que, entre as dimensões «liberdades individuais» e «esfera pública», é a primeira que justifica a ligeira curva decrescente ao nível das liberdades em Portugal no estudo do «Democracy Barometer»; por outro lado, que os baixos valores são provocados pelos indicadores da esfera pública. Como veremos em seguida, estas conclusões são bastante diferentes dos resultados do BQD de 2011, que parece aproximar-se mais da análise feita pela FH.\n\nO que pensam os portugueses\n\nO conjunto de questões incluídas no estudo do BQD pretendia analisar até que ponto os portugueses sentem que podem exercer livremente\n\nEkaterina Gorbunova e Filipa Raimundo\n\n168\n\nFigura 6.7 – Qualidade da democracia: liberdades individuais (LI) e esfera pública (EP) em Portugal (1990-2007)\n\nFonte: «Democracy Barometer», www.democracybarometer.org.\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\nLI – Direito à integridade física LI – Liberdade de consciência, religião, culto e circulação EP – Liberdade de associação EP – Liberdade de opinião\n\n1990\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n13 Ainda que a dimensão «liberdades individuais», tal como foi criada pelo «Democracy Barometer», contenha ainda o indicador de «Estado de direito», esses dados não serão apresentados aqui, uma vez que o tema é tratado no capítulo 1 deste livro, da autoria de Luís de Sousa.\n\nDireitos e liberdades e qualidade da democracia em Portugal\n\nos direitos e liberdades civis e políticos fundamentais no processo político democrático, nomeadamente os ligados à liberdade de voto, de associação, de expressão, etc. Como indicam os resultados apresentados na figura 6.8, a maioria dos cidadãos afirma que os direitos ao voto, à religião e à associação são «totalmente» ou «bastante» garantidos pelo Estado. Em primeiro lugar, o «direito de cada um a votar em quem quiser sem ser pressionado» foi considerado por 63% dos inquiridos totalmente ou bastante garantido em Portugal. Efectivamente, olhando para a realidade portuguesa ao longo de, pelo menos, a última década, não se podem detectar deficiências ao nível deste direito político fundamental consagrado na Constituição desde 1976. Os portugueses podem mudar o seu governo de uma forma democrática através das eleições competitivas, livres, justas e in 169\n\nFigura 6.8 – Garantia dos direitos e liberdades individuais em Portugal\n\nNota: Percentagens de pessoas.

A lei reserva para cada sexo, no mínimo, um terço dos lugares nas listas eleitorais ao nível nacional, local e nas eleições para o Parlamento Europeu. O segundo direito que os portugueses consideraram mais garantido em 2011 foi «o direito de cada um a praticar a sua religião, se a tiver» (60%). Essa percepção pública parece ser consistente com os desenvolvimentos feitos nessa área, nomeadamente a aprovação da lei da liberdade religiosa em 2001.14 Embora o país seja predominantemente católico romano, tanto a Constituição como a lei garantem e protegem a liberdade de religião e proíbem a discriminação religiosa. A lei da liberdade religiosa de 2001 criou um quadro legislativo para grupos religiosos estabelecidos no país há, pelo menos, trinta anos ou aqueles reconhecidos internacionalmente há, pelo menos, sessenta anos. A lei prevê para estes grupos religiosos benefícios anteriormente reservados apenas para a Igreja Católica: estatuto de isenção fiscal completo, reconhecimento legal de casamentos e outros ritos, o direito de capelães de fazerem visitas em prisões e hospitais e o respeito de férias tradicionais. Ao longo dos últimos anos não houve nenhum relatório governamental ou não governamental a detectar abusos ou discriminação com base na filiação, crença ou prática religiosa. Em terceiro lugar, metade dos inquiridos (50%) considerou que «o direito de cada um a juntar-se à associação ou organização que entenda» está muito ou bastante garantido em Portugal. Esta percentagem parece ser um pouco mais baixa do que sugere uma análise da realidade portuguesa, uma vez que as fontes consultadas não fazem referência a obstáculos à liberdade de associação. A Constituição consagra a liberdade de reunião e de associação e o governo, em geral, respeita estes direitos na prática. ONG, nacionais e internacionais, incluindo organizações de direitos humanos, operam no país sem interferência do governo. Em relação a outros direitos e liberdades individuais, os resultados são menos positivos. Menos de metade dos inquiridos (41%, 40% e 38%) sentem-se seguros em poderem realizar os seus direitos de expressão, de presunção de inocência e de privacidade, respectivamente. Uma percentagem ainda menor de portugueses acha que os direitos a não sofrer abusos policiais e a não ser discriminado estão garantidos\n\n14 Lei da liberdade religiosa, Assembleia da República, Lei n.º 16/2001, de 22 de Junho, http://www.ucp.pt/site/resources/documents/ISDC/LLR.pdf, consultado em 20-10-2012.\n\nDireitos e liberdades e qualidade da democracia em Portugal\n\n171\n\npelo Estado: apenas 35% e 33% dos portugueses, respectivamente, consideram estes direitos totalmente ou bastante garantidos. Nestes casos parece haver bastante fundamento para essa percepção, como sugere a leitura dos relatórios da FH e do Departamento de Estado norte-americano. É importante sublinhar ainda que os resultados do estudo de 2011 são piores do que os encontrados no estudo de 2009 promovido pela SEDES. A percentagem dos inquiridos que se sentem livres a exercer o seu direito de voto baixou dos 72% para 63%; a mesma tendência verifica-se em relação ao direito de associação (67% em 2009 vs. 50% em 2011) e ao direito de expressão (62% em 2009 vs. 41% em 2011) (Magalhães 2009).\n\nQualidade da democracia e satisfação com a democracia\n\nAs garantias dos direitos e liberdades individuais fundamentais – uma das dimensões fundamentais da qualidade da democracia e o foco principal deste capítulo – têm sido pouco exploradas como possíveis factores da satisfação com a democracia (Rose et al. 1998; Pollack et al. 2003; Shechtel 2010). No entanto, partindo de uma abordagem que vê o apoio a regimes democráticos com uma variável dependente, parece lógico supor que este valor fundamental15 e dimensão substantiva da qualidade da democracia16 tem de ter um contributo bastante significativo na formação de uma avaliação geral sobre o funcionamento do regime democrático em Portugal. Uma revisão da literatura sugere dois grupos de possíveis variáveis explicativas da satisfação com a democracia: (1) variáveis sócio-económicas e sócio-culturais de nível individual; (2) variáveis de nível nacional, nomeadamente características institucionais do regime e seus resultados económicos. Os defensores do primeiro grupo de factores focam a sua investigação em vários indicadores sociológicos e culturais relacionados com a cultura política (ou cívica) dos cidadãos, as percepções sobre o legado autoritário e a experiência com a democracia, as características sócio-demográficas (sexo, nível de escolaridade, religiosidade, etnicidade, etc.) e o seu impacto no apoio ao sistema político (Almond e Verba 1965; Dowley e Sil 15 Que faz parte dos valores de auto-expressão, essenciais para a criação das democracias (usando o conceito de Inglehart (1988)). 16 Usando o conceito de Larry Diamond e Leonardo Morlino (2005).\n\nEkaterina Gorbunova e Filipa Raimundo\n\n172\n\nver 2002; Evans e Whitefield 1995; Inglehart 1988; Lipset 1959; Mishler e Rose 1994; Rose et al. 1998, entre outros). No âmbito da segunda abordagem, vários autores mostraram que a economia é um factor determinante para definir as atitudes dos cidadãos em relação à democracia (Clarke et al. 1993; Lewis Beck e Stegmaier 2000, entre outros). Por outro lado, recentemente, um crescente número de estudos sobre sistemas democráticos começou a considerar uma série de características institucionais como factores-chave da transição democrática e da consolidação dos regimes democráticos (Lijphart 1999; Andreev 2003; Anderson e Guillory 2003; Hobolt 2012; Magalhães 2003; Norris 1999 e 2011, entre outros). Assim, utilizando os dados do BQD, testámos a possível relação causal entre a avaliação dos direitos e liberdades individuais por parte dos cidadãos e o seu nível de apoio e satisfação com o funcionamento da democracia em Portugal, supondo que, quanto melhor é a avaliação dos direitos e liberdades individuais, maior será a satisfação com o funcionamento da democracia. Como se pode verificar no quadro 6.1, que apresenta os coeficientes de correlação entre as respectivas variáveis, os níveis de satisfação com a democracia têm uma correlação estatisticamente significativa com a garantia dos principais direitos e liberdades individuais fundamentais. Todas as correlações são positivas, o que significa que as avaliações mais positivas dos cidadãos sobre os seus direitos e liberdades estão correlacionadas com a maior satisfação com o funcionamento da democracia em Portugal. O índice de garantia dos direitos e liberdades, que foi construído na base das avaliações medianas dos oito direitos/liberdades, também tem uma correlação bastante forte com os níveis de satisfação com a democracia.17\n\nTendo em conta a existência desta relação, coloca-se a questão de testar a sua natureza causal, ou seja, de ver se uma avaliação positiva de garantia dos direitos e liberdades em Portugal (como factores, ou variáveis preditoras) contribui para uma melhor satisfação com a democracia (como variável dependente). Numa tentativa de controlar outros possíveis factores de apoio ao regime, foram construídos três modelos, aos quais aplicámos a análise de regressão linear. O modelo 1 tem como variável dependente o nível de satisfação com a democracia e as variáveis\n\n17 As avaliações de garantia dos principais direitos e liberdades individuais também têm uma correlação estatisticamente significativa com duas outras variáveis de apoio à democracia: a preferência da democracia como forma de governo e a avaliação de funcionamento da democracia em comparação com há cinco anos.\n\nDireitos e liberdades e qualidade da democracia em Portugal\n\n173\n\npreditoras são as avaliações de garantia dos direitos e liberdades individuais (em forma de índice) e da liberdade de comunicação social. O modelo 2 tem como objectivo avaliar o impacto da opinião pública sobre os direitos e liberdades fundamentais, controlando as variáveis sócio-económicas de nível individual propostas pela literatura e disponíveis no questionário aplicado pelo BQD, nomeadamente o sexo, a idade, o nível de escolaridade (instrução), o estatuto profissional (empregado/desempregado), a ideologia política (posição na escala esquerda-direita) e a dimensão populacional do habitat. Por sua vez, o modelo 3 tenta controlar o efeito das outras dimensões da qualidade da democracia, adaptadas no âmbito do projecto, nomeadamente o Estado de direito, a participação, a representação, a responsividade (responsiveness), a igualdade e a autonomia do poder político/governação. O quadro 6.2 resume os principais resultados desta análise de regressão. Embora os modelos de regressão aplicados expliquem uma pequena percentagem dos casos disponíveis na base de dados do BQD, prova-se que as garantias dos principais direitos e liberdades individuais têm importância significativa para uma percepção mais positiva sobre a qualidade da democracia em Portugal. Assim, o nível de satisfação com a democracia é explicado em 5% pela garantia dos direitos e liberdades fundamentais e da liberdade da comunicação social (v. o modelo 1). O modelo 2 demonstra que a avaliação dos direitos e liberdades tem efeito na satisfação com a democracia mesmo quando controlamos as variáveis de natureza individual. Estas variáveis, de um modo geral, influenciam pouco a satisfação com a democracia, uma vez que apenas o\n\nQuadro 6.1 – Correlação entre as avaliações de garantia dos direitos e liberdades e a satisfação com a democracia em Portugal\n\nAvaliação dos direitos e liberdades principais Correlação com a satisfação com a democracia\n\nLiberdade de expressão 0,132 ** Liberdade de associação 0,144 ** Liberdade de voto 0,083 ** Direito de não ser discriminado 0,173 ** Liberdade de religião 0,069 * Direito a não sofrer abusos policiais 0,184 ** Direito à privacidade 0,240 ** Direito à presunção de inocência 0,212 ** Índice dos direitos e liberdades 0,214 ** Liberdade de comunicação social 0,185 **\n\nNota: Coeficiente de corelação de Spearman; *p < 0,05; **p < 0,001.\n\nEkaterina Gorbunova e Filipa Raimundo\n\n174\n\nQuadro 6.2 – Factores da satisfação com a democracia em Portugal: avaliação dos direitos e liberdades, variáveis do nível individual e outras dimensões da qualidade da democracia\n\nVariáveis – preditoras Modelo 1 Modelo 2 Modelo 3\n\nDireitos e liberdades individuais 0,148 *** 0,138 ** 0,087 ** Liberdade da comunicação social 0,111 *** 0,128 ** 0,110 **\n\nSexo 0,018 Idade 0,006 Instrução 0,141 ** Estatuto profissional 0,012 Ideologia –0,155 *** Habitat 0,018 Efeito da crise económica –0,119 ** Fontes de informação sobre a política 0,072 *\n\nEstado de direito 0,173 *** Participação política –0,068 ** Responsividade –0,023 Direitos sociais 0,122 *** Representação –0,105 *** Autonomia do poder político 0,111 *** R² 0,049 0,125 0,155 N\n\nNotas: nos modelos 1-3 foi usado o método de regressão linear. *p < 0,1; **p < 0,05; ***p < 0,001. Variáveis Satisfação com a democracia: 1 = totalmente satisfeito; 5 = nada satisfeito. Direitos e liberdades individuais: índice – média de variáveis a medir a garantia de oito direitos e liberdades individuais; 1 = totalmente garantido; 5 = nada garantido. Liberdade de comunicação social: 1 = totalmente livre; 5 = nada livre. Sexo – variável dummy: 0 = feminino; 1 = masculino. Idade: em anos. Nível de instrução: 1 = universitário; 2 = curso médio; 3 = 12.° ano (7.° ano liceal); 4 = 9.° ano (5.° ano liceal); 5 = 6.° ano (2.° ano liceal); 6 = instrução primária completa, instrução primária incompleta/analfabeto.

Responsividade: índice – média de variáveis a medir o nível de acordo/desacordo com sete frases sobre a capacidade e vontade que os políticos demonstram para responder aos problemas das pessoas; 1 = muito de acordo; 5 = muito em desacordo.\n\nDireitos e liberdades e qualidade da democracia em Portugal\n\nimpacto do grau de instrução e da ideologia é estatisticamente significativo. Assim, quanto mais escolarizados e mais à direita se encontram os inquiridos, mais satisfeitos com a democracia. Do mesmo modo, tendem a estar mais satisfeitos com a maneira como funciona a democracia no país os portugueses que se sentem menos afectados pela actual crise económica e que são mais informados sobre a política. Similarmente, o modelo 3 prova o efeito positivo da avaliação dos direitos e liberdades fundamentais na satisfação com o funcionamento do regime, controlando outras dimensões da qualidade da democracia (das quais apenas a responsividade não tem um impacto estatisticamente significativo no nosso modelo).\n\nConclusões\n\nNeste capítulo analisámos a evolução real e percepcionada dos direitos sociais e políticos dos cidadãos portugueses ao longo dos últimos anos. Os direitos e liberdades civis são frequentemente encarados como estando na base dos outros princípios que formam as democracias contemporâneas (Beetham 2004). Segundo esta lógica, a participação política requer que os cidadãos tenham liberdade para se expressarem e comunicarem no seio da sociedade civil; a responsabilização (accountability) requer que os governantes sejam eleitos a partir de um processo livre e justo em que todas as opiniões sejam admitidas e todos os candidatos tenham igual acesso aos recursos e aos meios de comunicação existentes; a responsividade (responsiveness) requer que os cidadãos possam articular os seus interesses e opiniões de forma livre e igual. O Estado de direito e a igualdade, outros dos princípios fundamentais dos regimes democráticos, estão também substancialmente associados aos direitos e liberdades dos cidadãos. Neste sentido, analisar a protecção legal, a aplicação prática e a percepção dos cidadãos sobre esta matéria torna-se essencial em qualquer estudo sobre a qualidade da democracia.\n\n175\n\nDireitos sociais: índice – média de variáveis a medir a garantia de quatro direitos sociais; 1=totalmente garantido; 5 = nada garantido. Representação: média de duas variáveis: (1) instituições e pessoas que melhor dão voz às preocupações das pessoas em Portugal, dummy: (1 = actores políticos; 0 = outros actores); (2) existência de um partido político que representa as opiniões dos portugueses razoavelmente bem; dummy (1 = sim, 0 = não). Autonomia do poder político: média de duas variáveis: (1) capacidade do governo para tomar decisões, independentemente da vontade dos governos de outros países; (2) capacidade do governo para tomar decisões, independentemente da situação económica internacional; 1 = total de margem de manobra; 5 = nenhuma margem de manobra.\n\nOs dados produzidos pelo «Democracy Barometer» indicam que, por um lado, a qualidade da democracia na Europa tem vindo a melhorar ligeiramente ao longo dos últimos anos. Por outro lado, os indicadores dos direitos sociais e políticos revelam uma tendência inversa. Este contraste sugere que a qualidade da democracia tem melhorado devido à melhoria de outros indicadores e não a uma melhor protecção dos direitos e liberdades dos cidadãos. Por sua vez, os dados produzidos pelo European Values Study sugerem que, genericamente, os cidadãos europeus estão progressivamente menos satisfeitos com as suas democracias e isso é particularmente evidente no caso português. De forma semelhante, os dados produzidos pelo «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia» do ICS-UL demonstram que os portugueses têm uma percepção menos positiva do que seria desejável sobre a protecção e o cumprimento dos seus direitos e liberdades. Com base no que ficou dito atrás, o contraste entre a melhoria da qualidade da democracia, por um lado, e os dados sobre a satisfação com a democracia, por outro, justificaram uma análise da possível relação de causalidade entre a garantia dos direitos e liberdades e a satisfação com a democracia. Os resultados provam que a avaliação pública dos direitos e liberdades tem efeito na satisfação com a democracia (embora esse efeito não seja muito acentuado) mesmo quando controlamos outros possíveis factores como variáveis de natureza individual e outras dimensões da qualidade da democracia (dos quais apenas a responsividade não tem um impacto estatisticamente significativo no nosso modelo). Para provar a robustez do modelo, no âmbito de uma futura investigação, uma análise semelhante poderia ser feita utilizando dados longitudinais para vários países.\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nAlmond, G.

Estas opiniões foram apuradas através de um inquérito por questionário aplicado em Julho de 2011 e devem ser entendidas à luz deste contexto específico. Decorridos sensivelmente três anos sobre o despoletar da crise financeira de 2008, estávamos, à altura da aplicação do inquérito, no epicentro de uma das maiores crises económicas do Portugal democrático. Uma crise cujas repercussões políticas e sociais eram, já então, percebidas como sendo de monta. A sucessão de eventos fala por si. Em Junho de 2011 realizaram-se eleições legislativas antecipadas, nas quais o Partido Social-Democrata se sagrou vencedor, com 38,7% dos votos. Meses antes, a 6 de Abril, o governo socialista, liderado por José Sócrates, solicitara a intervenção da Comissão Europeia, do Banco Central Europeu (BCE) e do Fundo Monetário Internacional (FMI), a chamada troika, para assegurar o resgate financeiro do país, fazendo-o com o apoio dos dois partidos do centro-direita que viriam em breve a integrar a coligação governamental – PSD e CDS-PP.\n\n179\n\n* Responsável pela análise de dados (análises de regressão).\n\nFilipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n180\n\nPara além de termos de ter em atenção o contexto imediato em que as opiniões foram colhidas, a sua análise requer igualmente que se considere a história da evolução recente dos níveis de desigualdade em Portugal. Concretamente, as atitudes dos inquiridos sobre a desigualdade serão interpretadas tendo, sempre que possível, em linha de conta indicadores objectivos sobre a distribuição de rendimento, bem-estar e qualidade de vida, bem como sobre a evolução das despesas, em percentagem do PIB, com prestações sociais e o desempenho de outras funções sociais do Estado. Importa aqui, desde logo, salientar que, historicamente, Portugal é um dos países europeus com uma distribuição do rendimento mais desigual (por exemplo, Rodrigues 1994). Isto é fruto de vários factores, que vão desde a insipiência das políticas sociais do Estado Novo às iniquidades duradouras do nosso sistema fiscal, até à relativa ineficácia redistributiva do Estado-Providência pós-25 de Abril, para dar apenas alguns exemplos. Esta prevalência de uma distribuição muito desigual dos rendimentos colocava-nos, em 2008, entre os países mais desiguais da União Europeia (daqui em diante UE-27), com um coeficiente de Gini1 de 35, semelhante ao da Roménia e apenas inferior ao da Letónia (37) e ao da Lituânia (36). Isto apesar de durante a década de 2000, em resultado de políticas sociais orientadas para os grupos sociais mais excluídos, como o rendimento mínimo garantido, os valores da desigualdade terem registado uma melhoria sensível, com o já referido coeficiente de Gini a passar de 38,1, em 2004, para 33,7, em 2009 (Rodrigues 2007). No entanto, a crise financeira de 2008 parece poder vir a pôr em causa algumas das ligeiras melhorias alcançadas, podendo mesmo vir a reverter a tendência recente para a redução da enorme assimetria de rendimentos que caracteriza o nosso país. Um estudo recente da Comissão Europeia,2 em que se comparam os efeitos das políticas de austeridade sobre a distribuição de rendimento em seis países europeus, incluindo Portugal, sugere que é precisamente entre nós que se irá verificar o mais significativo aumento da desigualdade, com os mais pobres a sofrerem os efeitos da crise proporcionalmente mais do que os mais ricos.3 O relevo excepcional dado\n\n1 O coeficiente de Gini mede a desigualdade numa sociedade, variando entre 1 (desigualdade máxima: todos os rendimentos na posse de uma só pessoa) e 0 (desigualdade mínima: todas as pessoas recebem exactamente o mesmo). 2 V. http://www.socialsituation.eu/research-notes/SSO2011%20RN2%20Austerity% 20measures_final.pdf. 3 Um estudo interessante sobre o possível impacto das intervenções do FMI na qualidade da democracia pode ser encontrado em Nelson e Wallace (2011).\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\npelos inquiridos ao problema da desigualdade não é independente da magnitude que ele assume estruturalmente entre nós e da perspectiva realista do seu agravamento futuro. Não basta, porém, analisar isoladamente as atitudes dos inquiridos perante a desigualdade na distribuição de rendimentos, ainda que tendo em conta dados contextuais macro de ordem sócio-económica. Para que consigamos interpretar as atitudes dos inquiridos portugueses perante a desigualdade de forma adequada, é igualmente necessário que as comparemos com as atitudes dos cidadãos de outros países. Conscientes desta necessidade, importámos algumas das questões colocadas em Portugal do inquérito por questionário Understanding Attitudes to Tackling Economic Inequality realizado em Inglaterra por Louise Bamfield e Tim Horton para a fundação Joseph Rowntree em Junho de 2009, isto é, sensivelmente dois anos antes da aplicação do inquérito em Portugal. Isto permite-nos comparar as atitudes dos inquiridos portugueses com as dos inquiridos britânicos perante um mesmo fenómeno: a desigualdade sócio-económica. Embora a extensão da comparação a outros países fosse desejável, ela é impossível neste momento, já que a bateria de questões por nós importada não foi, entretanto, colocada além da Inglaterra, com quem Portugal partilha, de resto, os lugares cimeiros nas tabelas da desigualdade entre as democracias consolidadas. O terceiro vector da nossa análise das atitudes dos portugueses perante a desigualdade é, por conseguinte, este mesmo: o da comparação internacional, neste caso, e pelas limitações anunciadas, com o Reino Unido. Este enquadramento triplo – contexto imediato da aplicação do inquérito, indicadores sócio-económicos de conjuntura, e comparação internacional (limitada às questões sobre a desigualdade, uma vez que as questões sobre os direitos sociais são exclusivas do inquérito português) – irá guiar a nossa leitura dos resultados apurados segundo o modelo de análise que construímos. Trata-se de um modelo com dois blocos de variáveis: o primeiro centra-se em atributos individuais, como sejam o sexo, a idade, o grau de instrução, a profissão e o local de residência, ao passo que o segundo se estende a práticas e atitudes, designadamente a prática religiosa e as opiniões sobre as relações entre o Estado, a sociedade e a economia (a dimensão ideológica da luta política que aqui se está a ter sobretudo em conta é a de «mais ou menos Estado», tal como apurada a partir de questões incluídas no inquérito, como, por exemplo, «devem as empresas públicas ser privatizadas ou mantidas na esfera do Estado?»). Este modelo de análise foi aplicado às opiniões dos inquiridos portugue 181\n\nses sobre três núcleos de questões fundamentais relacionadas com desigualdade e os direitos sociais, a saber:\n\n1) As opiniões dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade sócio-económica, com particular ênfase nas suas atitudes perante os grupos no topo e na base da escala de rendimento; 2) O posicionamento dos portugueses face aos diferenciais salariais e a medidas políticas de controlo da desigualdade, designadamente através do sistema fiscal; 3) A avaliação feita pelos portugueses da importância relativa dos direitos sociais mais directamente ligados ao combate à pobreza e à desigualdade, assim como a sua opinião quanto ao grau de garantia efectiva desses direitos no nosso país.\n\nÉ de salientar o carácter original da análise que aqui se oferece. A literatura sobre a desigualdade usa normalmente indicadores sócio-económicos como fonte de evidência empírica. O recurso a estudos de opinião é, pelo contrário, relativamente marginal. O que este estudo faz, à semelhança aliás do seu congénere inglês, embora não podendo ser tão exaustivo quanto ele, é não apenas examinar as atitudes dos inquiridos perante a desigualdade de rendimentos e perante as intervenções do Estado no sentido do seu controlo, como também apurar algumas das razões subjacentes a essas atitudes, com destaque para os factores (crenças, valores e normas distributivas) que subjazem aos juízos de equidade feitos. Tudo isto é feito ademais prestando-se especial atenção à possibilidade de existirem atitudes distintas perante a desigualdade na sociedade portuguesa, sendo indispensável apurarem-se alguns dos padrões mais salientes dessa distribuição atitudinal desigual. Igualmente inovadora é a análise das atitudes dos portugueses perante a desigualdade para se aferir da sua percepção sobre a qualidade da democracia no seu país. Vários estudos têm demonstrado que a satisfação com a democracia é afectada por indicadores subjectivos e objectivos de desempenho económico, bem assim como por percepções dominantes sobre a qualidade de vida e a qualidade dos serviços públicos. A esta constatação outros estudos vieram acrescentar que, mesmo entre os países ricos, os que são mais desiguais têm um desempenho inferior em quase todo o indicador de qualidade de vida imaginável: esperança de vida, mortalidade infantil, obesidade, criminalidade, literacia, ou mesmo níveis de reciclagem, para mencionar apenas alguns (Wilkinson e Pickett 2009). Pior ainda, admitindo que os efeitos sociais da desigualdade são tão per Filipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n182\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\nniciosos quanto estes estudos propõem, os seus efeitos políticos podem ser altamente divisionistas. É que, se as desvantagens da desigualdade estiverem distribuídas de forma muito assimétrica, serão poucos os incentivos à solidariedade entre fronteiras sociais, que se tornaram virtualmente insuperáveis. Isto torna a acção comum para a resolução do problema «desigualdade» (que não é percebido por todos enquanto tal) e a própria sustentabilidade do Estado social muito difícil (Runciman 2009). Em suma, os níveis excessivos de desigualdade não são apenas um problema para a consolidação das democracias: eles são também um problema de difícil resolução, que em certos casos se arrisca a alienar do regime uma parte substancial da população. A igualdade é, de resto, uma componente central da problemática política moderna (Wagner 1994 e 2001), e o Estado-Providência do pósguerra representa uma tentativa de realizar substantivamente esse princípio, em democracia, numa via media entre o comunismo e o liberalismo. O problema da desigualdade assume, portanto, contornos político-ideológicos bem demarcados. Em traços gerais, pode afirmar-se que, se, para o liberalismo, a prioridade vai para os direitos humanos de primeira geração (civis e políticos), uma prioridade associada a uma concepção de igualdade essencialmente política, formal ou jurídica, já a defesa dos direitos humanos de segunda geração (sociais, económicos e culturais), mais directamente relacionados com o combate à pobreza e o controlo da desigualdade, ficou, na maioria dos casos, a cargo de socialistas, comunistas e da esquerda, em geral, para os quais a igualdade, antes de ser formal ou política, tem de ser substantiva ou sócio-económica. É de salientar, porém, que a doutrina social da Igreja, influente entre os partidos democratas-cristãos um pouco por toda a Europa católica, Portugal incluído, enfatiza igualmente o princípio da igualdade, embora já não do ponto de vista da luta de classes, mas antes da solidariedade entre diferentes grupos sociais, assente no princípio da socialidade da pessoa humana e da responsabilidade social de cada um. De resto, desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial que fomos assistindo a uma gradual convergência entre a tradição social-democrata de uma solidariedade social, assente primeiramente em interesses de classe (neste caso, a classe trabalhadora), e a tradição cristã-democrata, assente na dignidade do homem enquanto pessoa e na qualidade eminentemente relacional/social desta última. À medida que deixaram de ser partidos de trabalhadores para se transformarem em partidos do povo e em partidos de eleitores, de uma forma mais geral, os partidos sociais-democratas deixaram de enfatizar o tema do conflito de classes, que substituíram por temas mais inclusivos e próximos da demo 183\n\ncracia cristã, como o da interdependência social. Ainda assim, algumas diferenças tenderam em persistir, embora variando de país para país, com os democratas-cristãos a insistirem no princípio da subsidiariedade e na colaboração entre o Estado e a sociedade civil na atribuição de apoios sociais e os partidos sociais-democratas a tenderem para uma visão mais universalista e centralizadora do sistema (por exemplo, Stjerno 2005). Em resumo, a saliência política do problema da desigualdade é extremamente significativa, porquanto exprime clivagens ideológicas profundas entre as várias famílias políticas quanto à melhor sociedade e ao papel do Estado na sua promoção. Analisar como este problema está a ser reequacionado em tempos de crise económico-financeira pelos portugueses é, por conseguinte, tão urgente quanto relevante para compreendermos os seus juízos quanto à qualidade da nossa democracia e a sua sensibilidade a diferentes argumentos de combate à desigualdade, que poderão servir de fundamento ao desenvolvimento futuro de políticas públicas. Este capítulo organiza-se em três secções. Cada uma delas centra-se numa das questões acima elencadas: a saber, (1) as atitudes face à desigualdade sócio-económica, com destaque para as desenvolvidas por relação aos grupos do topo e da base da escala de rendimento; (2) o nível de tolerância dos inquiridos face às diferenças remuneratórias e o seu posicionamento face à acção redistributiva do Estado, nomeadamente através dos impostos; (3) a sua concepção de quais os direitos sociais mais importantes e o respectivo grau de garantia no país. Nos dois primeiros casos, a análise feita beneficiará de uma comparação com os resultados obtidos no âmbito do inquérito de opinião britânico. Já no caso dos direitos sociais, sua importância relativa e nível percebido de garantia, os dados disponíveis referem-se apenas ao universo nacional.\n\nOs portugueses e a desigualdade: percepções, indicadores e comparação internacional\n\nEm plena crise económica e financeira, uma das piores desde a grande depressão, não é surpreendente que a desigualdade esteja no centro das preocupações, quer da população em geral, quer das próprias elites, que se vêem a braços com um forte declínio na confiança pública nos governos e no próprio sector financeiro e empresarial. Um estudo de 2012 do Fórum Económico Mundial sobre os riscos enfrentados expressa exactamente isto, ao prever a possibilidade de desequilíbrios económicos graves e uma desigualdade social crescente poderem vir a reverter os ganhos ob Filipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n184\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\n185\n\ntidos nas últimas décadas por efeito da globalização.4 Assim, o painel de mais de 400 especialistas do mundo académico, empresarial e governamental não hesita em conceder lugar cimeiro ao agravamento das desigualdades sociais entre as suas preocupações para a próxima década. Com efeito, existe hoje uma percepção generalizada de que o crescimento económico nas últimas décadas é coisa do passado e que mesmo ele não foi repartido de forma equitativa por todos os grupos sociais, com a concentração do rendimento nos grupos mais abastados a agravar-se a partir do final da década de 80. No início de 2008, a BBC levou a cabo uma sondagem de opinião em 34 países, com quase dois terços dos inquiridos a mostrarem-se especialmente preocupados com a desigualdade da repartição do rendimento e riqueza nos seus países. Entre os portugueses, este valor subia para mais de 80%, colocando-nos a par de países como a Coreia do Sul, a Turquia e a Itália.5 Estes dados são, aliás, congruentes com os registados noutros estudos de opinião, incluindo o presente estudo do ICS sobre a qualidade da democracia, em que a pobreza e a exclusão social são o segundo problema mais referido pelos inquiridos, apenas atrás do desemprego (ele próprio um dos factores geradores de pobreza e exclusão). Existem certamente razões para esta preocupação com a pobreza e a desigualdade em Portugal. Para além de registar uma taxa de pobreza superior à média europeia, com quase 18% da população em situação de pobreza em 2008 (quadro 7.1), mesmo depois de contabilizadas as transferências sociais,6 Portugal é também um país profundamente desigual do ponto de vista da distribuição do rendimento. Em meados desta década, o nosso coeficiente de Gini encontrava-se 24% acima da média da OCDE, sendo só inferior ao registado pelo México e pela Turquia.7 Entre os 27 países membros da União Europeia, apenas a Letónia e a Lituânia são mais desiguais do que o nosso país, que apresenta um perfil de distribuição de rendimento altamente assimétrico: em 2008, os 20% mais ricos auferiam 43,2% do rendimento disponível, a percentagem mais elevada da UE-27, ao passo que o rendimento disponível pela demais população estava consistentemente abaixo do auferido nos demais países da UE (figura 7.1).\n\n4 V. http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-risks. 5 V. www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf. 6 Nos EUA, os efeitos da chamada «grande recessão» sobre a pobreza são ainda mais notórios. Entre 2006 e 2010, o número de pessoas em situação de pobreza aumentou de 36,5 milhões para 46,2 milhões, um aumento de 27% (v. Seefeldt et al. 2012). 7 V. OCDE, 2008, 25.\n\nNote-se que a pobreza de um país e o seu nível de desigualdade sócio-económica representam problemas bastante distintos. É isto mesmo que nos revela o estudo recente de Richard Wilkinson e Kate Pickett, publicado em Portugal sob o título O Espírito da Igualdade em 2010. Segundo os resultados deste estudo, o PIB per capita é muito menos significativo na explicação do bem-estar geral de uma população do que o tamanho da distância entre os 20% mais ricos e os 20% mais pobres da população. Noutras palavras, o facto de um país ser mais ou menos pobre explica significativamente menos a variância de um vasto leque de indicadores so Filipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n186\n\nQuadro 7.1 – Taxa de risco de pobreza antes e após as transferências sociais nos países da UE-27\n\nFonte: Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, SILC 2009 (Eurostat). Nota 1: O risco de pobreza em causa no quadro 7.1 é calculado a partir de um limiar de pobreza correspondente a 60% do rendimento nacional líquido mediano. Nota 2: Os valores apresentados para o risco de pobreza antes das transferências sociais incluem as transferências de rendimentos do Estado para as famílias referentes a pensões.\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\nciais do que a distribuição de rendimento nesse país. Quer falemos de esperança média de vida, mortalidade infantil, conflitualidade entre crianças, níveis de obesidade, taxas de criminalidade ou níveis de literacia, quanto mais igual é uma sociedade, melhor tende a ser também a sua performance. Assim, de gráfico em gráfico, Wilkinson e Pickett medem estas funções de bem-estar e os resultados são, no mínimo, provocadores: o melhor preditor do posicionamento relativo dos países não são as diferenças entre eles (o que poria os EUA no topo, seguidos, a não muito larga distância, dos países escandinavos e do próprio Reino Unido, com as nações mais pobres da Europa, como Portugal, na base da escala), mas, isso sim, as diferenças de rendimento e riqueza dentro de cada um deles (o que coloca os EUA, enquanto país mais desigual, nas piores posições na avaliação de\n\n187\n\nFigura 7.1 – Representação da relação entre a desigualdade de rendimento e a participação política\n\nNota: Os valores apresentados para a «desigualdade» correspondem à média da desigualdade de rendimento (percentil 80 e percentil 20), Programa das Nações Unidas para o Desenvolvimento – Rel. de Desenvolvimento Humano, para o período 2003-2007.

Por outras palavras, parece ser a desigualdade de rendimento, e não o rendimento per se, que tem o impacto mais negativo sobre a qualidade de vida e bem-estar das populações. Sendo que ambas as medidas têm um impacto considerável sobre a satisfação das populações com as suas democracias, não seria surpreendente que num país como Portugal, com fortíssimas assimetrias de rendimento, essa satisfação e a preferência pela democracia que ela alimenta ficassem aquém do desejável. Isso mesmo revelam os dados por nós apurados, com a larga maioria dos portugueses (65%) a dizer sentir-se pouco ou nada satisfeita com o funcionamento da democracia no nosso país (note-se que, em 2009, esse valor era consideravelmente inferior, 51%; v. Magalhães 2009) e 15% a conceberem a preferência por um governo autoritário. A isto acresce que entre os maiores defeitos apontados ao funcionamento da democracia conta-se o seu output em termos de desigualdades sociais (10%), que, na opinião dos inquiridos, é apenas superado pela ineficácia dos governos (11%) e pela desconfiança dos políticos (19%). Também nas temáticas que mais preocupam os portugueses, as questões sócio-económicas ganham uma dianteira inequívoca (desemprego, pobreza, exclusão social), sendo de esperar que esta tendência se veja agravada nos próximos anos, até porque 70% dos inquiridos afirmam já ter visto a sua qualidade de vida diminuída em razão da crise. Mas, se as desigualdades sócio-económicas parecem ter um forte impacto sobre as medidas de bem-estar e mesmo a satisfação com o regime, seguese uma outra questão. Terá a desigualdade um impacto negativo também sobre as práticas e as normas de cidadania democráticas? Os gráficos 7.1 e 7.2, em que se correlaciona a desigualdade de rendimentos com comportamentos e normas democráticos, mostram um padrão claro – quanto mais desigual é um país, menor é a participação política, informal ou não eleitoral, dos seus cidadãos e menor é também a sua adesão a normas democráticas de «boa cidadania». Estes resultados macro vêm corroborar uma extensa literatura sobre os efeitos da desigualdade sócio-económica sobre a democracia. Desde logo, existe evidência empírica que sugere que a desigualdade dificulta não tanto as transições para a democracia, que podem ser instigadas por ela, quanto os processos de consolidação democrática (Houle 2009). Estas dificuldades que a desigualdade coloca à consolidação dos regimes democráticos, maxime à própria qualidade da democracia (Bermeo 2009, 25 Filipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n188\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\n-26), podem revestir-se de várias formas. Em primeiro lugar, são bem conhecidos os efeitos perniciosos da desigualdade sócio-económica sobre a igualdade política. A voz política (isto é, a frequência e intensidade da participação formal e informal, o grau percebido e efectivo de eficácia política e a capacidade de influência sobre o aparelho de Estado e os decisores políticos) das elites tende a fazer-se ouvir muito mais do que a das restantes classes sociais, quando não a silencia por completo (por exemplo, Rueschemeyer 2004, 79). Assim, não surpreende que a literatura especializada chame há muito tempo a atenção para o impacto negativo da desigualdade sobre o interesse pela política (Solt 2008, 54). A isto acresce que uma distribuição de rendimento fortemente assimétrica potencia o aumento do apoio a políticas e políticos populistas, o desenvolvimento\n\n189\n\nFigura 7.2 – Representação da relação entre a desigualdade de rendimento e o envolvimento cívico (norma de cidadania)\n\nNota: Os valores apresentados para a «desigualdade» correspondem à média da desigualdade de rendimento (percentil 80 e percentil 20), Programa das Nações Unidas para o Desenvolvimento – Rel. de Desenvolvimento Humano, para o período 2003-2007.

De igual forma, a relação entre a desigualdade e um conjunto de comportamentos nocivos ao bom funcionamento democracia está bem documentada, sublinhando-se quer a diminuição da participação eleitoral e não eleitoral, quer o alastramento de formas mais genéricas de desafeição democrática, quer ainda os efeitos políticos divisórios e a resultante polarização político-partidária (Anderson e Beramendi 2008, 303; Ostby 2008). Finalmente, a desigualdade sócio-económica foi analisada do ponto de vista do seu impacto negativo sobre diversas formas de má governação, desde o tráfico de influências à erosão genérica do império da lei (Karl 2000, 156). O presente estudo visa contribuir para esta literatura, ajudando a esclarecer de que modo, no nosso país, a desigualdade sócio-económica afecta a avaliação que os cidadãos fazem do funcionamento da nossa democracia. Em particular, iremos analisar a forma como os inquiridos portugueses se posicionam face à desigualdade sócio-económica, aos diferenciais salariais e às políticas redistributivas do Estado, designadamente\n\nFigura 7.3 – Coeficiente de Gini (UE-27)\n\nFonte: Observatório das Desigualdades.\n\nLetónia\n\nLituânia\n\nPortugal\n\nRoménia\n\nBulgária\n\nGrécia\n\nReino Unido\n\nEspanha\n\nItália\n\nEstónia\n\nPolónia\n\nNovos Estados membros\n\nFrança\n\nLuxemburgo\n\nAlemanha\n\nIrlanda\n\nChipre\n\nMalta\n\nHolanda\n\nDinamarca\n\nBélgica\n\nFinlândia\n\nÁustria\n\nRepública Checa\n\nEslováquia\n\nSuécia\n\nHungria\n\nEslovénia\n\nUE-27 = 30\n\n37 36 35 35 33 33 32 32 32 31 31 31 30 29 29 29 28 28 27 27 26 26 26 25 25 25 25 23\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\nas de ordem fiscal, bem como a importância que atribuem aos direitos sociais e a distância que eventualmente encontram entre a sua promessa constitucional e a sua prestação efectiva. Nesta secção debruçamo-nos sobre o primeiro destes tópicos, as atitudes dos inquiridos portugueses sobre a desigualdade de rendimentos. Os portugueses são dos povos que no mundo mais preocupação revelam com o nível de desigualdade apresentado no seu país. Trata-se, de resto, de uma preocupação que, como vimos, tem uma fortíssima razão de ser, se tivermos em consideração os indicadores sócio-económicos disponíveis. Mas será que esta preocupação é sentida por todos os portugueses de igual forma? Noutras palavras, como se distribuem as atitudes perante a desigualdade pela população? Para responder a esta questão temos de analisar em que medida a «desigualdade» é ou não entendida de formas distintas por diferentes segmentos da sociedade portuguesa e quais as crenças e valores que subjazem a essa diferença, confrontando estes diferentes entendimentos da desigualdade, quer com indicadores sócio-económicos de ordem mais objectiva, quer com as opiniões manifestadas pelos cidadãos britânicos sobre este mesmo tema. Com efeito, dos dados recolhidos é possível verificar que as opiniões dos portugueses quanto à desigualdade variam significativamente de grupo para grupo, sendo que estas opiniões são igualmente sensíveis ao tipo concreto de desigualdade que está em questão. Isto é, nem todas as formas de desigualdade são consideradas igualmente problemáticas (algumas até serão percebidas como desejáveis, porquanto ligadas ao mérito e ao esforço) e a posição relativa de cada grupo na sociedade portuguesa determina igualmente em boa medida a respectiva percepção deste problema – quanto maior a distância entre ricos e pobres for percepcionada como sendo muito significativa (sobretudo, se for considerada ilegítima), maior relevo será conferido a esse problema. Neste ponto, é importante recordar que quase todos os inquiridos portugueses, em linha com o que se passa noutros países, tendem a posicionar-se subjectivamente na «classe média», o que equivale a dizer, mais ou menos a meio da distribuição de rendimentos da nossa sociedade. Este autoposicionamento subjectivo contrasta com a alocação de lugares na escala de rendimentos pelo cientista social, para quem a «classe média»8 portuguesa, consoante o modelo analítico empregue, varia aproximadamente entre um terço e pouco mais de metade da população portuguesa (Roldão 2008, 20). A verdade, porém, é\n\n191\n\n8 No jargão sociológico, «pequena-burguesia/lugares contraditórios de classe».\n\nFilipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n192\n\nque a esmagadora maioria dos inquiridos responde às questões que lhe são colocadas a partir desta posição intermédia a que julga pertencer.9\n\nEste facto é de salientar na medida em que tem um impacto não negligenciável sobre as percepções individuais e de grupo sobre a desigualdade. Isso mesmo foi tido em conta aquando da formulação das perguntas, em que se perguntava aos inquiridos qual o seu nível de concordância com as seguintes afirmações:\n\na) As pessoas da classe média estão a viver tempos muito difíceis porque não têm acesso nem às recompensas dos ricos nem aos apoios recebidos pelos mais pobres; b) As pessoas mais ricas estão a viver tempos muito difíceis porque trabalham muito, vivem sob grande pressão e têm maiores responsabilidades; c) As pessoas mais pobres estão a viver tempos muito difíceis porque não têm acesso às recompensas dos ricos e são pouco apoiadas socialmente.\n\nAssim, quando questionados sobre quais os grupos sociais que estarão a atravessar maiores dificuldades no contexto da actual crise económica, os inquiridos portugueses distinguiram claramente entre aqueles que viam como estando acima de si, aqueles que consideravam estar num mesmo patamar social e aqueles que entendiam estar numa situação mais desfavorável do que a sua. E, se foram particularmente solidários com estes últimos – 82% dos inquiridos concordaram com a afirmação de que são as pessoas mais pobres que estão a atravessar tempos mais difíceis –, mostraram-se já bastante cépticos quanto às dificuldades que a crise colocaria aos mais ricos. Uma clara maioria de 61% dos inquiridos discordou da afirmação de serem as pessoas mais ricas quem está a viver tempos mais difíceis em razão das particulares pressões e responsabilidades que sobre elas recaem. Em contraste com este cepticismo relativamente aos que estão acima de si, uma maioria muito expressiva dos portugueses – 70% – considera que é a classe média (aquela em que se localizam) que mais está a sofrer neste período de crise porque não tem\n\n9 Apesar de esta questão não ter sido colocada aos inquiridos neste inquérito por questionário, esta tendência para o autoposicionamento por parte da maior parte das pessoas na «classe média» é largamente corroborada pela literatura (Evans e Kelley 2004; Osberg e Smeeding 2006). No inquérito inglês, aliás, quase todos os inquiridos se colocaram subjectivamente na «classe média» (Bamfield e Horton 2009, 28).\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\nacesso às recompensas dos ricos nem às prestações sociais dos mais pobres. Para vermos melhor o que estes números significam comparemo-los com os dados obtidos em Inglaterra. Em ambos os países há um acordo muito substancial de que é a classe média – isto é, o grupo onde os inquiridos se colocam – que está a atravessar maiores dificuldades por não ter os apoios sociais dos mais pobres nem o desafogo dos mais ricos. Este valor, já elevado entre nós, 70%, sobe para os 79% em Inglaterra. Mas as semelhanças entre estes dois países terminam aqui. Em Inglaterra, apesar de se considerar que a desigualdade resulta, desde os anos 80, de os mais ricos se terem tornado ainda mais ricos (uma percepção que a revelação pública recente dos salários e bónus auferidos no sector bancário veio fortemente agudizar, muito embora, segundo dados de 2008, dos países da UE-27, seja em Portugal, não em Inglaterra, que os 20% mais ricos auferem a percentagem mais elevada de rendimento disponível, 43,2%), existe uma percepção generalizada de que alguma desta desigualdade reflecte importantes diferenças de talento e mérito – as diferenças salariais, por exemplo, são justificadas por muitos dos inquiridos por premiarem as qualificações, o mérito e o esforço de quem mais ganha.10 Já os portugueses, quando colocados perante a questão de as diferenças salariais serem positivas por incentivarem a produtividade, manifestam a opinião oposta: uma clara maioria, 61%, discorda da associação entre o rendimento salarial e o esforço individual prevalecente entre os britânicos. Esta diferença parece ter assento, pelo menos parcial, nas percepções profundamente discrepantes dos inquiridos em cada um dos países quanto às oportunidades de progressão social. Se em Inglaterra apenas 26% não consideram que existam oportunidades suficientes para que pessoas de todas as origens sociais possam subir na vida, entre os portugueses o cepticismo é dominante: 58% dos inquiridos partilham a opinião de que em Portugal não existem oportunidades suficientes de ascensão social. Esta enorme diferença tem consequências de monta para a forma como os inquiridos vêm os mais pobres. Os inquiridos em Inglaterra são muito explícitos na responsabilização dos mais pobres pela sua situação, culpabilizando-os pela exploração indevida das prestações sociais e demonstrando uma relativamente reduzida solidariedade para com as suas dificuldades, sobretudo quando comparada com aquela que se verifica em Portugal. Traduzindo em números, 59% dos britânicos crêem ser os pobres quem está a atravessar maiores dificuldades neste período de crise,\n\n193\n\n10 V. Bamfield e Horton (2009, 13).\n\nao passo que em Portugal este valor ascende aos 82%. Temos assim que as atitudes dos inquiridos portugueses e ingleses relativamente aos diferenciais na distribuição do rendimento nos respectivos países se tornam inteligíveis apenas quando temos igualmente em linha de conta as suas opiniões quanto aos processos que estão na origem dessas desigualdades, com destaque para a forma como os indivíduos adquirem qualificações, empregos e recursos na sua sociedade e para o nível de oportunidades nela abertas a cada um. Em Inglaterra, a convicção de que a desigualdade é um resultado inevitável do regular funcionamento da economia de mercado e a convicção na existência de reais oportunidades de mobilidade social, dando a todos potencial acesso a rendimentos superiores, resultam numa forte responsabilização individual pela pobreza e pela desvantagem sócio-económica. Daqui decorre também uma significativa culpabilização dos mais pobres pela sua situação, bem como pela alegada exploração do sistema de prestações sociais, que contrasta com uma menor recriminação da exploração do sistema fiscal pelos mais ricos e dos custos que ela implica. Em Portugal, pelo contrário, a convicção generalizada é a de que as oportunidades de ascensão social – de assegurar as qualificações necessárias à entrada no mercado de trabalho, de conseguir um emprego, de progredir na carreira e de dessa forma realizar o potencial de cada um – são escassas. Sendo maioritária a opinião de que, no nosso país, as pessoas não têm iguais oportunidades de acesso e progressão, os portugueses fazem um menor juízo de valor relativamente aos mais pobres, responsabilizam-nos menos pela sua situação (que atribuem mais a factores estruturais) e mostram uma maior empatia para com as adversidades que correntemente atravessam. A comparação internacional já nos permitiu antever algumas explicações para as atitudes dos portugueses face à desigualdade entre ricos, pobres e a absorvente «classe média». Mas o que podemos dizer sobre o que explica tais atitudes? Será que as opiniões sobre a desigualdade são independentes da idade que temos, de sermos de esquerda ou de direita, homens ou mulheres, vivermos num meio urbano ou rural? Como veremos de seguida, a resposta a esta questão é negativa. Na realidade, quem somos e o que fazemos, as nossas crenças e valores, dão-nos pistas importantes para percebermos melhor o que está na origem das nossas atitudes diferenciadas sobre a desigualdade e, mais do que ela, sobre a desigualdade enquanto problema. Por exemplo, a questão de se saber se são os mais ricos aqueles que estão correntemente a sentir maiores dificuldades gera um desacordo tanto maior quanto o inquirido for de esquerda, não frequente a igreja, seja a favor de «mais Estado», designada Filipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n194\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\nmente na forma da manutenção das empresas públicas, e dê prioridade à manutenção da lei e da ordem sobre a defesa das liberdades cívicas. A convicção da esquerda tradicional de que o sucesso ou insucesso de cada um tem razões estruturais profundas, desde logo a estrutura de classes e as relações de poder que ela engendra, e a sua desconfiança relativamente aos «ricos», com destaque para o «capital» e os seus agentes, são factores determinantes na sua resposta. Já, se aplicarmos o mesmo modelo à questão de se saber se será a classe média a mais afectada, os resultados são bem diferentes: neste caso, o desacordo com esta ideia é tanto maior quanto se for do sexo feminino, tiver um grau de instrução e um estatuto social elevados e tiver (como no caso anterior) uma opinião favorável à manutenção das empresas públicas na esfera do Estado. Temos aqui, muito possivelmente, um leque misto de respondentes, que agrega igualitaristas tradicionais, com atitudes positivas face aos grupos mais desfavorecidos e à intervenção do Estado para a sua protecção, e indivíduos com uma atitude mais liberal, cuja atitude mais positiva por relação ao topo (em que se encontram) não tem necessariamente de coexistir com uma atitude negativa por relação aos mais pobres. Por fim, a aplicação do nosso modelo à questão de se saber se os mais pobres são os mais afectados pela crise – uma hipótese que sai corroborada pelo estudo da Comissão Europeia citado no início deste capítulo – revela que o desacordo é tanto mais elevado quanto o respondente seja jovem, quanto mais baixo seja o seu estatuto social, quanto mais costume ir à igreja e seja a favor da ilegalização do aborto. Este resultado é curioso, e é-o em várias frentes, que exigem mais aturada discussão. Se são os mais jovens que menos peso atribuem às dificuldades dos mais pobres, talvez a sua atitude esteja parcialmente explicada pela forte incidência do desemprego jovem e pela apreensão quanto ao seu próprio futuro, designadamente em termos da existência das prestações e apoios sociais que hoje assistem aos mais pobres. Por sua vez, a ida frequente à igreja e a posição pró-vida desenham, na escala dos valores, um perfil conservador que se coaduna bem com uma tendência para a responsabilização individual pelos sucessos e insucessos de cada um e para a associação destes resultados com o «querer-se ou não trabalhar». E, por fim, a falta de empatia dos inquiridos de menor estatuto social para com as dificuldades dos mais pobres, que serão, muito possivelmente, dificuldades análogas às suas, parece relevar de uma resistência das pessoas socialmente mais desfavorecidas em abrirem mão do seu autoposicionamento subjectivo na classe média. Fazê-lo seria em muitos casos equivalente a pôr a descoberto uma pobreza escondida e a assumir as dificuldades por que estão a passar. Esta\n\n195\n\nFilipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n196\n\ninsistência no posicionamento a meio da tabela de rendimento pode também ter origem no simples desconhecimento das condições de vida das classes mais favorecidas ou numa estratégia cognitiva defensiva, orientada para a redução das aspirações e a maximização da satisfação presente com o (pouco) que têm.\n\nSumário\n\nIndicadores e atitudes sobre a desigualdade Portugal destaca-se no panorama internacional pelos elevados níveis de desigualdade na distribuição do rendimento e este facto tem reflexo na grande saliência que os inquiridos conferem a este problema.\n\nA desigualdade vista do meio Os inquiridos portugueses olham para a desigualdade sócio-económica do ponto de vista da «classe média», em que se localizam subjectivamente, e, talvez fruto das dificuldades que sobre eles impendem, 70% partilham a opinião de que é a «classe média» o grupo que mais dificuldades enfrenta em resultado da crise económica e financeira. Apesar disto, os inquiridos portugueses, em contraste com os seus congéneres britânicos, não deixam de demonstrar uma empatia e solidariedade muito expressivas para com a situação dos mais pobres (82%), sendo ao mesmo tempo bastante cépticos quanto às dificuldades sentidas pelos mais ricos (61%) na presente conjuntura. Esta última opinião é mais comum entre pessoas de esquerda, que não costumam ir à igreja e que são contra a privatização de empresas públicas.\n\nComparação com a Inglaterra As atitudes dos inquiridos britânicos sobre a pobreza e a desigualdade são muito diferentes das dos inquiridos portugueses. Em Inglaterra prevalece a percepção de que existem oportunidades para que todos possam subir na vida e que a desigualdade existente reflecte essa estrutura de oportunidades – isto é, uns ganharão mais porque fazem por isso, ao passo que outros ganharão menos em grande parte por falta de empenho em fazerem uso dessas oportunidades e, portanto, por responsabilidade própria. Em Portugal, pelo contrário, a pobreza e a desigualdade são vistas como reflectindo não tanto uma hierarquia de mérito individual quanto uma estrutura desigual de oportunidades, que deslegitima os lugares cimeiros na escala do rendimento e se constitui como um entrave sério a trajectórias de mobilidade social ascendente pelo trabalho e esforço.\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\n197\n\nOs portugueses e a acção redistributiva do Estado\n\nApesar de se revestir de uma natureza social e económica, a desigualdade é antes de mais um problema eminentemente político. Desde logo, porque a própria construção da desigualdade como um problema que diz respeito a todos e exige a intervenção rectificadora do Estado é algo que releva do político e do ideológico. Noutros termos, é a partir de uma certa concepção de justiça distributiva, da sociedade em que se quer viver e da relação ideal entre o Estado, a economia e a sociedade que a desigualdade é constituída enquanto problema passível de resolução, ou, pelo menos, de correcção parcial, e já não enquanto mera fatalidade. Em segundo lugar, porque o combate à desigualdade sócio-económica exige a intervenção do Estado, a instituição política por excelência. Entre as funções do Estado de direito democrático, e para além das decorrentes da protecção dos direitos, liberdades e garantias, contam-se assim as suas funções sociais, que ganharam crescente expressão no decurso do último século e meio. Desta forma, foi a própria legitimidade dos regimes políticos democráticos que ficou associada à respectiva capacidade para proteger os cidadãos em situações de risco potencial (por exemplo, na infância, na doença, no desemprego e na velhice) através de prestações sociais abertas a todos, em particular aos segmentos mais desfavorecidos da população. Esta transformação e ampliação das funções do Estado exprime a evolução do modelo liberal clássico do Estado do século XIX, no âmbito do qual a igualdade política foi sendo progressivamente assegurada, para o modelo social do Estado do pós-guerra, em que as preocupações com a igualdade sócio-económica foram ganhando maior relevo (Silva 2009, 24-26). Em Portugal é apenas a partir dos anos 60, com o marcelismo, e sobretudo após o 25 de Abril de 1974, com a consagração constitucional de um Estado-Providência que obedeça a princípios de universalidade, generalidade, descentralização e gratuitidade, que as funções sociais do Estado foram assumindo um papel de destaque na legitimação e consolidação do regime. Tanto assim que estudos recentes, anteriores ao do «Barómetro da Qualidade da Democracia», revelaram que os portugueses atribuem primazia não aos aspectos processuais, mas, isso sim, aos aspectos substantivos da democracia, que, em sua opinião, se traduzem na sua capacidade de garantir a todos um nível mínimo condigno de vida (Magalhães 2009). Em tempos de contenção severa da\n\nFilipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n198\n\ndespesa pública e de necessária racionalização, quando não mesmo circunscrição, de alguns dos programas e prestações sociais associados ao Estado-Providência, adquire especial importância averiguar até que ponto este está a realizar a sua promessa redistributiva e que apoio se pode encontrar ou – porque a representação política deve ser dinâmica – criar na opinião pública para a sua reforma, na base de uma discussão pública informada sobre que reforma pode e deve ser essa. Como se conclui da análise dos dados do inquérito aplicado em Inglaterra e da deliberação em focus groups que se lhe seguiu, construir apoio público para o combate à desigualdade sócio-económica exige que se entenda primeiro que diferentes grupos partirão de posições diferentes (designadamente quanto aos valores e normas distributivas que informam a sua posição perante a desigualdade) e reagirão de forma diversa também a diferentes tipos de argumento a favor de políticas públicas de combate a essa desigualdade. Um pouco por toda a Europa, e seguramente em Portugal, poderemos estar a atingir o limite do que pode ser feito no combate à pobreza e à desigualdade furtivamente, isto é, na ausência de esforços explícitos no sentido da tematização desta problemática junto da opinião pública e da construção de um consenso tão extenso quanto possível sobre em que medida, e por que meios, a desigualdade deve ser combatida. Conhecer as posições de partida de grupos distintos da população e os factores que lhes subjazem, para assim lhes poder falar e os poder influenciar, é tarefa essencial para todos os que estejam empenhados na remoção de eventuais iniquidades no presente sistema de prestações sociais e no questionamento deste aparente fatalismo que é ter Portugal e a Inglaterra, a secundarem os Estados Unidos, na tabela das sociedades mais desiguais. Nas duas secções que se seguem analisam-se as atitudes dos inquiridos portugueses sobre diferentes dimensões da acção do Estado no combate à desigualdade: as opiniões sobre o impacto redistributivo da política fiscal praticada em Portugal são o tema da primeira secção, enquanto as suas opiniões sobre os direitos sociais e económicos, que dão respaldo constitucional às políticas sociais em áreas como a educação, a saúde, a habitação e a segurança social, são o tema da última secção deste capítulo. Uma das formas mais óbvias de desigualdade sócio-económica é a desigualdade salarial. As disparidades salariais, quando muito significativas e tornadas públicas, são usualmente motivo de sentimentos de injustiça relativa e, por vezes, até de indignação – sobretudo se acompanhadas pela percepção de que os salários mais elevados não são\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\n199\n\nmerecidos, mas antes de uma estrutura de oportunidades fortemente enviesada, que reforça as desigualdades e impede a mobilidade dos sectores tradicionalmente excluídos. Não é, por conseguinte, de estranhar que uma larga maioria dos inquiridos portugueses (61%) tenha rejeitado a ideia de que seria positivo para o país existirem grandes diferenças salariais, uma opinião tanto mais comum quanto os indivíduos sejam de esquerda, não costumem ir à igreja, sejam a favor da manutenção de empresas públicas e considerem que o Estado deve ser o único responsável no sector da saúde. Verifica-se, uma vez mais sem surpresa, uma certa coincidência entre este grupo e o que havia expresso o seu cepticismo quanto às dificuldades por que estariam a passar os mais ricos. Mas será que encontramos opiniões mais favoráveis relativamente às disparidades salariais entre os inquiridos britânicos? Na verdade, e este foi um dos dados mais surpreendentes do estudo de 2009, parece estarmos a assistir a uma transformação significativa das atitudes verificadas em Inglaterra nesta matéria, uma transformação que surge, aliás, em resposta à crise financeira e às subsequentes medidas de austeridade (Bamfield e Horton 2009, 35). Esta mudança atitudinal reflecte-se numa rejeição mais convicta das disparidades salariais do que aquela registada no período anterior à crise, em que elas eram bem mais toleradas. Hoje em dia são os super-ricos, mais do que os simplesmente ricos, que atraem a condenação social e que reabrem a questão de saber se o mérito e o esforço são realmente factores preponderantes na ascensão ao topo da escala sócio-económica. Se alguns inquiridos objectaram ao rendimento dos super-ricos na base do argumento da necessidade («é demasiado para as necessidades de qualquer pessoa»), a maioria entendeu que o que os super-ricos ganham é simplesmente desproporcional às suas competências e talentos e não tem apoio nos resultados produzidos (sobretudo no sector bancário) ou na sua contribuição para a sociedade. Contudo, a riqueza esteve longe de ser condenada em todos os casos e o juízo feito sobre os simplesmente «ricos» variou de acordo com a avaliação do ponto de partida do indivíduo em causa, de como havia adquirido essa riqueza e de como a havia utilizado subsequentemente. Isto é, os inquiridos ingleses não se opuseram a rendimentos altos desde que percepcionados como merecidos, até porque, apesar de abalada, encontra-se ainda arreigada a sua confiança na existência de oportunidades de ascensão suficientes. Contudo, a revolta social relativamente às remunerações auferidas no centro financeiro de Londres e pelas chefias de empresas (nelas incluídas empresas públicas), em que os inquiridos entenderam ver regras básicas da equidade violadas, teve algum efeito de\n\ncontágio para além destes dois grupos de «super-ricos», gerando um apoio substantivo à regulação dos pagamentos no topo e à imposição de impostos mais altos sobre eles. Assim, 70% dos inquiridos britânicos mostraram-se de acordo com a ideia de que as pessoas com salários mais altos não pagam através dos seus impostos o suficiente para financiar os serviços públicos. Tivemos oportunidade de replicar esta questão em Portugal e os resultados não foram muito diferentes dos registados em Inglaterra. 66% dos inquiridos portugueses concordaram com a afirmação de que «as pessoas com rendimentos mais altos não pagam com os seus impostos a parcela justa da solidariedade para com os mais pobres», embora a ausência de um estudo longitudinal nos impeça de poder afirmar se entre nós esta opinião é fruto das circunstâncias da crise, como aconteceu em Inglaterra, ou, pelo contrário, expressa crenças e valores mais estruturais de um país pobre e que não passou pela liberalização económico-financeira do tatcherismo. Em contrapartida, colocámos uma nova questão aos inquiridos portugueses sobre eventuais efeitos perversos da acção fiscal do Estado, nomeadamente se achavam que em Portugal os impostos são tão altos que não compensam, ou até desincentivam, as pessoas de maior talento. Uma maioria de 56% dos inquiridos portugueses afirmou concordar com esta opinião, uma posição sobretudo prevalecente entre, como seria de esperar, os profissionais mais qualificados, com estatuto social mais elevado, residentes em centros urbanos. Mas também ideologicamente de esquerda e socialmente progressistas, o que mais uma vez vem revelar a pluralidade de esquerdas que existem à esquerda em Portugal. Mais ainda, este resultado aponta para o facto de a preocupação com os excessos no topo e as dificuldades vividas por aqueles que ocupam a base da escala sócio-económica não pressupor necessariamente a adesão a uma visão igualitarista tradicional, nem tão-pouco um apoio a uma maior despesa pública com prestações sociais quando esta implique um aumento de impostos, sobretudo se percepcionado como operando um redistribuição que viola desigualdades justas. Por esta razão, uma postura moralista e proselitista no combate à desigualdade pode, em muitos casos, perder a favor de argumentos de defesa da igualdade mais diferenciadores e ponderados, por exemplo, como forma de garantir recompensas efectivamente proporcionais ao esforço e contribuição de cada um.\n\nFilipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n200\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\nSumário\n\nDesigualdade sócio-económica: a sua natureza política A desigualdade sócio-económica é um problema eminentemente político, não só porque é sempre a partir de uma certa posição ideológica e de uma visão do tipo de sociedade em que queremos viver que a desigualdade é constituída ou não como um problema e mais ainda como um problema passível de correcção pela intervenção estatal.\n\nEstado redistributivo: salários e impostos Quando questionada sobre as disparidades salariais, uma larga maioria dos inquiridos portugueses (61%) mostrou-se contrária à existência de grandes diferenças salariais. Esta opinião revelou-se mais comum entre indivíduos de esquerda, que não costumam ir à igreja, que são a favor da manutenção de empresas públicas e que consideram que o Estado deve ser o único responsável no sector da saúde. Finalmente, uma maioria clara dos inquiridos portugueses (56%) acha que os impostos em Portugal estão demasiado altos, na medida em que desincentivam o talento.\n\nComparação com a Inglaterra Comparando os resultados obtidos em Portugal com os apurados no Reino Unido, verifica-se uma grande semelhança quanto aos valores médios da discordância face às disparidades salariais. Se em Inglaterra existem indícios de que esta é uma atitude nova, desenvolvida em resposta aos escândalos com os rendimentos e bónus dos trabalhadores do sector financeiro, em Portugal a impossibilidade de comparação entre os períodos antes e depois da eclosão da crise impede-nos de chegar a uma conclusão definitiva quanto ao carácter mais ou menos estrutural da nossa relativa intolerância face às diferenças salariais.\n\nOs portugueses perante os direitos sociais\n\nO tema desta terceira e última secção são as atitudes dos inquiridos portugueses sobre alguns dos mais importantes direitos sociais consagrados na nossa Constituição. Como tornámos claro anteriormente, para percebermos as atitudes do público perante a desigualdade e perante as respostas que lhe são dadas em termos de políticas públicas não basta que apuremos como e por que razão certos indivíduos são vistos como mais ou menos merecedores da posição que ocupam na escala sócio-económica. Igualmente importante é perceber qual a relação entre o «mérito» e outras normas distributivas que podem ser de igual ou maior força numa\n\n201\n\ndeterminada sociedade, designadamente a «necessidade» ou «o direito a» (desde logo, o direito de propriedade, mas também os direitos a prestações sociais). Note-se, por exemplo, que a decisão de dar assento constitucional a determinados direitos os investe de uma força simbólica singular, não sendo por acaso que no nosso país a luta política em torno da reforma do Estado social se tece frequentemente na linguagem da defesa ou liquidação da Constituição e dos direitos sociais que nela se consagraram. Foi em larga medida com base nestes direitos fundamentais que se construiu o Estado-Providência em Portugal após o 25 de Abril de 1974: a secção sobre os direitos sociais da Constituição da República Portuguesa, aprovada dois anos após a revolução de Abril, definiu os princípios e determinou com bastante precisão as linhas mestras das funções sociais do Estado (por exemplo, Silva e Vieira 2010). É, pois, compreensível que seja comum a associação entre a dimensão social da Constituição e a natureza social da nossa democracia ou até entre aquela dimensão constitucional e a natureza da nossa democracia stricto sensu. Esta associação esconde amiúde uma outra: entre os direitos sociais e, mais assim, os direitos sociais constitucionalizados, por um lado, e o combate à pobreza, à exclusão social e à desigualdade sócio-económica, por outro. No entanto, estamos perante uma associação que está longe de ser inequívoca. Desde logo, importa notar que a inclusão na Constituição de um catálogo nutrido de direitos sociais não leva necessariamente a mais prestações sociais ou ao aumento do seu peso em percentagem do PIB. Com efeito, à luz dos dados apurados em estudos comparativos internacionais, da constitucionalização de tais direitos seria insensato esperar-se um sistema de segurança social mais forte, despesas mais avultadas em saúde e educação, e muito menos um Estado social com um desempenho superior no controlo da pobreza, da exclusão e da desigualdade. É que na maioria dos casos a relação entre os direitos sociais constitucionalizados e estes macrorresultados é inexistente ou, quando muito, ténue e reservada a domínios concretos de intervenção social do Estado (Blume e Voigt 2007; Ben-Bassat e Dahan 2007). O mesmo acontece com a alegada relação entre os direitos sociais constitucionalizados e a democracia. Mais do que a sua mera consagração ou assento constitucional, o que parece importar é a forma como tais direitos foram conquistados, constitucionalizados e implementados. Catálogos semelhantes de direitos sociais estiveram tanto ao serviço da contenção da luta social e da legitimação de regimes autoritários (v. os casos da Alemanha de Bismarck, da Alemanha nazi e da URSS de Estaline, todas elas bastante generosas em matéria de direitos sociais) quanto ao serviço da legitimação de regimes democráti Filipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n202\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\ncos e da cidadania inclusiva por que se pautam (v. os Estados-Providência europeus do pós-guerra). No caso do nosso país, o facto de os direitos sociais e a democracia terem uma co-origem simbólica na Constituição e se terem desenvolvido a par e passo desde então (por exemplo, o direito à saúde é constitucionalizado em 1976, mas o sistema nacional de saúde cuja criação ele prevê nasce oficialmente em 1979) parece ter levado a uma significativa identificação entre ambos (Magalhães 2009, 37-38). Por conseguinte, o que os inquiridos portugueses pensam sobre os direitos sociais e o seu nível percebido de garantia diz-nos algo de muito importante sobre o que pensam sobre a qualidade da nossa democracia: quanto mais importância conferem aos direitos sociais, mas menos acreditam na sua efectiva garantia, mais estarão convencidos de que a promessa democrática – que, a acreditar nos estudos de opinião, entendem ser sobretudo uma promessa de igualdade não apenas formal, mas substantiva – está a ser traída. É justamente isto que tentaremos analisar de seguida. Comecemos pela importância que os inquiridos portugueses dão aos direitos sociais mais directamente ligados ao controlo dos riscos sociais e ao combate à pobreza, à desigualdade e à exclusão. Colocados perante uma lista de quatro direitos sociais, os inquiridos não tiveram dúvidas em eleger o direito à saúde como o mais importante – uma expressiva maioria de 77% –, seguido, a grande distância, do direito à habitação (43%), do direito à educação (38%) e do direito à segurança social (33%). A saliência dada ao direito à saúde explica-se em larga medida pela natureza «especial» do bem protegido por este direito. Relembremos, a este respeito, as palavras de Amartya Sen, para quem o direito à saúde ocupa uma posição privilegiada na ordenação moral dos direitos humanos, na medida em que remete para as «condições humanas mais elementares» (Sen 1992, 5) e constitui, por isso mesmo, a base sobre a qual se fundam as capacidades humanas e o seu potencial de desenvolvimento. Esta intuição moral sai reforçada pelo facto, empiricamente constatado, de a doença ser um factor importante para a pobreza. Não causa, pois, surpresa que os portugueses concedam uma posição privilegiada ao direito à protecção da saúde quando questionados sobre a hierarquia dos mais importantes direitos sociais que a Constituição contempla. Menos esperada é porventura a saliência que conferem ao direito à habitação e a posição de menor visibilidade reservada ao direito à segurança social numa altura em que o desemprego atinge números recorde e a sustentabilidade futura das pensões e reformas começa a ser discutida. Precisaríamos de mais dados para interpretar a ordenação dos direitos sociais, mas o facto de a segurança social aparecer na cauda pode ter duas causas imediatas:\n\n203\n\numa é o facto de não ser imediatamente claro aos inquiridos quais as prestações sociais que cabem na segurança social, outra é o facto de as pensões e reformas serem coisa do futuro, numa altura em que os inquiridos estarão mais preocupados com as dificuldades e os sacrifícios que sob eles impendem no presente. Quando confrontamos estes resultados sobre a importância relativa dos direitos sociais com as opiniões dos inquiridos sobre o grau efectivo de garantia, o hiato é por de mais evidente, excepção feita ao direito à educação (com 24% a considerarem-no pouco ou nada garantido, 30% a terem-no por totalmente ou muito garantido e os restantes a verem-no por algo garantido). Por contraste, na saúde, se 77% dos inquiridos atribuíam a maior importância ao direito à sua protecção, apenas 19% consideram que este direito está efectivamente garantido, ascendendo a 33% a percentagem daqueles que o crêem pouco ou nada garantido entre nós, e isto apesar da avaliação positiva que os utentes tendem a fazer do sistema nacional de saúde (Cabral e Mendes 2002). Regista-se uma avaliação igualmente negativa do nível de garantia dos direitos à segurança social e à habitação. No primeiro caso, 43% dos inquiridos entendem-no pouco ou nada garantido, ao passo que apenas 16% o crêem garantido. Mais abrupta é a diferença no caso do direito à habitação, do qual 55% dos inquiridos dizem estar pouco ou nada garantido e apenas 9% estarem convictos da sua prestação efectiva. Este valor excepcionalmente baixo poderá ter diversas explicações. Uma delas é o facto de o direito à habitação tender a ser fomentado em Portugal de forma indirecta. Constitucionalmente, incumbe ao Estado promover um sistema de rendas compatível com o rendimento dos agregados familiares. Todavia, as responsabilidades do artigo 65.º têm sido menos asseguradas directamente pelo Estado, por exemplo, pela disponibilização de habitação social aos mais desfavorecidos ou através da prestação de subsídios ao arrendamento (excepção parcial feita ao arrendamento jovem), do que pelo sector «privado» de arrendamento, vendo-se os senhorios transformados, em muitos casos, em garantes do Estado social. Grande parte do mercado «privado» do arrendamento vive de há décadas a esta parte sob fortíssimos mecanismos de controlo de rendas impostos pelo Estado, o que, entre outras coisas, resulta num mercado de arrendamento muito exíguo e verdadeiramente dual, com, por um lado, rendas a preços de mercado (ou até acima deles) para os arrendatários mais jovens e, por outro, rendas a custo de «habitação social» para os arrendatários mais velhos, beneficiários de rendas controladas. Apesar de este controlo se consubstanciar na existência de muitas rendas no dito «mercado privado» a preços de\n\nFilipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n204\n\nDireitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\nhabitação social, em alguns casos usufruídas por pessoas realmente carenciadas, noutros usufruídas por uma classe média e até média-alta que continua a beneficiar de rendas controladas, em clara violação de qualquer regra de proporcionalidade com o rendimento do agregado familiar, quem usufrui de rendas controladas raramente as entende como uma «prestação social», fruto de uma forte regulação do Estado e com custos privados e também sociais muito elevados. Esta asfixia do mercado de arrendamento, em razão do controlo de rendas, e a disponibilidade, nas últimas décadas, de crédito à habitação relativamente barato (agora indisponível) empurraram os portugueses para a compra de casa. Também aqui o papel do Estado foi essencial, com o desenvolvimento de instrumentos incentivadores à aquisição de casa, como o crédito bonificado ou as deduções fiscais. Numa altura de crescimento das dificuldades das famílias em terem acesso ao crédito à habitação ou, quando já a adquiriram, em pagarem os empréstimos contraídos compreende-se o valor muito baixo atribuído, pelos respondentes deste inquérito, à protecção do direito à habitação. Acresce a este factor a liberalização parcial das rendas, que fazia parte do memorando da troika, muito embora os portugueses que buscam activamente informação de ordem política sejam poucos e esta questão apenas tenha ganho maior saliência recentemente com o anúncio e discussão pública da nova lei das rendas. A confiança na garantia dos direitos à educação ou à segurança social foi igualmente baixa, embora não tão baixa (9%, no caso da habitação, 30% e 16%, no caso da educação e da segurança social, respectivamente). O facto de a diferença entre a importância atribuída aos direitos sociais e o seu grau percebido de garantia ser tão substancial e transversal a todos os direitos sugere que estamos perante um questionamento sério da capacidade do Estado social para vingar os fins que se propôs, designadamente no controlo de riscos sociais, no combate à pobreza e no controlo da desigualdade. Sendo que as nossas estruturas produtivas, a performance da nossa economia e a nossa demografia concorrem para colocar poderosos entraves à sustentabilidade do Estado social que temos e que, tal como existe, já não corresponde às expectativas dos inquiridos, este questionamento pode ter efeitos perniciosos sobre o grau de apoio que venha a ser prestado à nossa democracia. Com efeito, quando questionados sobre qual a função ou dimensão mais importante da democracia, 89% dos inquiridos portugueses indicaram a garantia de um nível de vida digno para todos os cidadãos, um valor superior ao angariado por todas as demais dimensões da democracia elencadas, incluindo a existência de eleições livres e justas ou as liberdades de expressão e parti 205\n\nFilipe Carreira da Silva, Mónica Brito Vieira e Susana Cabaço\n\n206\n\ncipação. Não é, pois, inteiramente de descartar a possibilidade de a profunda apreensão manifestada pelos inquiridos portugueses quanto ao nível de garantia dos direitos sociais no nosso país, quando associada ao empobrecimento do país e ao agravamento das assimetrias sociais, poder transmutar-se num certo abalar da legitimidade democrática do regime ou, no limite – e para utilizar a expressão tornada corrente por Charles Tilly –, numa relativa desdemocratização do país (Tilly 2003, 41). Não haverá porventura melhor forma de terminar este capítulo do que recordar aos leitores o «efeito túnel», vivamente enunciado e descrito por Albert Hirschman e Michael Rothschild num artigo de 1973. Nesse célebre artigo, os autores consideram a transformação dos níveis de tolerância perante a desigualdade em diferentes estádios do desenvolvimento económico. Nos primeiros estádios, em que o desenvolvimento é rápido, diz-nos Hirschman, é provável que as diferenças de distribuição de rendimento entre classes, sectores e regiões aumentem também aceleradamente, mas isso não constituirá um problema insuperável, visto que as discrepâncias serão então bastante toleradas. Mas, acrescentam, essa tolerância é uma espécie de crédito a prazo, que a seu tempo tenderá para desaparecer. Ela assenta na expectativa de que essas grandes desigualdades, percebidas numa dada altura, venham a regredir. Contudo, se isto não acontecer, irão inevitavelmente eclodir problemas diversos. Na tentativa de conferirem maior visibilidade ao que dizem, os autores socorrem-se de uma analogia próxima da experiência quotidiana de todos. Suponhamos que entramos num túnel com duas faixas de circulação, ambas na mesma direcção, e que o congestionamento é enorme. Nenhum carro se mexe. E nós estamos parados na faixa da esquerda, já sem grande paciência. De repente, a faixa da direita começa a circular e o nosso espírito alegra-se na expectativa de que também os automóveis na nossa faixa, a esquerda, comecem a circular regularmente a qualquer momento. Mas suponhamos que a expectativa se vê gorada e, meia hora ou uma hora depois do desimpedimento da faixa direita, a nossa faixa continua parada, ao mesmo passo que a direita circula normalmente. Nessa altura (se não antes, porque a paciência dos automobilistas é notoriamente limitada...) é muito provável que nos sintamos injustiçados e percamos a paciência. Ao arrepio de todas as regras do código da estrada, seremos tentados a atravessar o duplo traço contínuo que separa as duas faixas, a única acção que parece agora resolver a situação (Hirschman 1973, 545). Estruturalmente muito desigual, o Portugal democrático viveu o final da década de 80 e sobretudo a década de 90 na esperança de um cresci Direitos iguais, vidas desiguais: as atitudes dos portugueses sobre a desigualdade\n\n207\n\nmento económico que o levasse a uma gradual e irreversível convergência com o resto da Europa. Mesmo aqueles cujo rendimento e bem-estar presente, em termos relativos, não se haviam alterado muito viam os seus parentes, vizinhos e, sobretudo, os seus filhos numa aparente rota de melhoria da sua situação social e económica, com melhores qualificações, com carro e casa próprios e com um poder de compra outrora inimaginável. Bebendo alguma gratificação com os avanços dos demais, camadas da população toleravam as assimetrias sócio-económicas na base da expectativa de que as oportunidades se disseminassem e de que um dia, não muito longe, a sua vez viesse efectivamente a chegar (e, se não a sua, a dos seus filhos). Em muitos casos, porém, ela não chegou e agora parece mais distante do que nunca. Em Portugal, a circulação no «túnel» de Hirschman está agora parada para todos, mas alguns nem chegaram bem a entrar. No passado, a experiência da recessão fez de alguns países, como o Japão, países mais iguais, mas ameaça fazer o nosso (tal como da Grã-Bretanha, que nos acompanhou tão de perto neste estudo) ainda mais assimétrico. Até quando o crescimento do fosso será compatível com o jogarmos todos as regras de um mesmo jogo, o democrático, sem atravessarmos traços contínuos, e entrarmos em rota de colisão, é o que definitivamente não devemos querer esperar para ver.\n\nSumário\n\nOs inquiridos portugueses perante os direitos sociais Esta secção analisou as atitudes dos inquiridos portugueses sobre quais os mais importantes direitos sociais. Constitucionalizados na sequência da nossa transição para a democracia, estes direitos serviram de princípio regulador ao Estado-Providência subsequentemente estabelecido em Portugal. Quando questionada sobre a ordenação dos direitos, uma larga maioria indicou, à cabeça, o direito à saúde (77%), seguido, a grande distância, do direito à habitação (43%). Só depois surgiram os direitos à educação (38%) e à segurança social (33%) nos terceiro e quarto lugares, respectivamente.\n\nIncerteza quanto à garantia dos direitos sociais Quando questionados sobre o nível de garantia destes direitos no nosso país, os inquiridos mostraram-se muito cépticos quanto à efectividade destes direitos: apenas 9% acreditam que o direito à habitação está totalmente garantido, um valor bastante inferior, mas não muito diferente, na insatisfação que revela, do referente ao direito à saúde, a que os inquiridos atribuem a maior importância (com apenas 19% dos inquiri dos a dizerem-se seguros de este direito estar totalmente garantido). Esta diferença significativa entre, por um lado, a importância atribuída aos direitos sociais e, por outro, o grau percebido da sua garantia parece sugerir uma apreensão generalizada quanto à capacidade de o Estado social satisfazer as suas promessas, com destaque para a protecção dos cidadãos face aos riscos sociais, para o combate à pobreza, para o controlo da desigualdade e para a garantia de uma maior igualdade efectiva de oportunidades (isto apesar da avaliação bem mais positiva da efectividade do direito à educação, que importa aqui assinalar). Sendo que os portugueses colocam a garantia de um nível condigno de vida no topo das exigências que fazem à democracia, esta avaliação claramente negativa do desempenho das suas funções sociais pode vir a ter repercussões na legitimidade que atribuem ao próprio regime democrático.\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nAnderson, C., e P.

Como Robert Dahl salienta, «uma característica fundamental da democracia é a contínua responsividade dos governos às preferências dos seus cidadãos, considerados politicamente iguais» (1971, 1). A responsividade política é, pois, a forma como as instituições políticas implementam decisões que reflectem as preferências dos cidadãos. Segundo Morlino e Diamond, este conceito integra três dimensões: o modo como as escolhas dos cidadãos são estruturadas em alternativas políticas coerentes representadas por partidos políticos distintos; a forma como as preferências dos cidadãos são agregadas e transformadas num governo com objectivos políticos; e a maneira como os membros do governo traduzem preferências e compromissos em políticas públicas e resultados (2005, XXIX). Trata, pois, de todos os elos da cadeia que compõem o sistema político. Sendo certo que o inquérito à população para aferir da qualidade da democracia em Portugal teve lugar já depois do resgate financeiro a Portugal – implicando assim uma limitação externa substancial em termos de políticas públicas –, é ainda mais pertinente compreender o estado da responsividade hoje em Portugal. Por um lado, podemos supor que, enquanto durar o programa de ajustamento, a responsividade está «suspensa», na medida em que nem o governo é soberano, nem está a im 211\n\nplementar uma agenda política determinada internamente. No entanto, sabemos também que o programa da troika foi legitimado nas urnas em Junho de 2011, com cerca de 80% dos votantes a escolherem partidos que apoiaram o programa de ajustamento. Importa assim compreender a percepção dos cidadãos em relação à cadeia de responsividade em Portugal após a entrada em vigor do programa de ajuda externa ao nosso país. É uma questão empírica à qual procuraremos dar resposta neste capítulo. Para tal iremos apresentar um quadro descritivo do estado da responsividade do nosso sistema político em 2011 com base nos dados de um inquérito à população realizado nesse ano.1\n\nEsse não é, no entanto, o único objectivo. Há, de facto, uma questão subjacente a que importa responder e que se prende com a evolução da responsividade num período temporal mais alargado. Especificamente, tal permite-nos compreender se a avaliação dos portugueses em relação à responsividade é significativamente alterada no período pós-2009, marcado por uma crise financeira e económica que culmina com o pedido de ajuda externa de 2011, ou se existem tendências de deterioração anteriores à crise económica. Interessa compreender estes timings por razões de causalidade. Se aferirmos que a degradação na responsividade é anterior a 2011, então o seu nível hoje não pode ser unicamente atribuído ao contexto de crise e ao programa de ajustamento. Iremos, pois, evidenciar longitudinalmente a evolução de alguns indicadores da responsividade, bem como tentar compreender se existem sinais de deterioração anteriores a 2009, momento em que a crise económica se torna mais evidente para os portugueses. Para averiguar este fenómeno tão lato quanto abrangente iremos mobilizar não só os dados do inquérito da qualidade da democracia, como também outros elementos que nos permitem inferir sobre a responsividade política da democracia portuguesa. Ao triangular estas diferentes fontes de informação – dados objectivos; avaliações externas de organizações relevantes; opiniões dos portugueses – podemos gerar uma análise mais completa da responsividade em Portugal. O capítulo começa por caracterizar a dimensão institucional da responsividade política, primeiro, em termos teóricos e, de seguida, analisando o caso português. Depois, serão examinados os dados individuais para compreender de que forma os portugueses percepcionam a respon Marina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n212\n\n1 O inquérito foi realizado pela GfK Metris durante o mês de Julho de 2011, junto de uma amostra representativa da população com 18 ou mais anos residente em Portugal continental e constituída por um total de 1207 inquiridos.\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\nsividade do sistema. Além disso, procuramos ir mais além, analisando os correlatos dessas atitudes com características sócio-demográficas e políticas dos cidadãos. Dessa forma poderemos tentar compreender qual o perfil daqueles que estão menos satisfeitos com o funcionamento do sistema político.\n\nResponsividade política: dimensão institucional\n\nTal como ficou claro acima, a responsividade é uma justificação central do próprio regime democrático. Quais serão os factores que poderão propiciar o alcance desse objectivo? Segundo Morlino e Diamond (2005,\n\nXXXVII), «um tipo de democracia parece estar melhor equipado para conseguir alcançar um maior nível de qualidade: aquele que gera maiores níveis de participação e competição política». A presença destas componentes – um eleitorado participativo que coloca exigências às instituições políticas, a par de instituições onde coexistam vários partidos que lutam pelo poder – assegura uma cadeia de responsabilização vertical (RV), isto é, uma responsabilização entre os eleitos e o eleitorado, perante o qual respondem. Governantes mais responsabilizáveis, em princípio, desenvolverão políticas que expressem a vontade dos eleitores e nesse sentido contribuirão igualmente para a responsividade. Beetham et al. (2008, 24) defendem que «tanto a responsividade como a responsabilização são necessárias para um controlo efectivo dos governos por parte dos cidadãos», contribuindo mutuamente para a qualidade da democracia. Se concebermos a responsividade como uma contrapartida da influência exercida pelos eleitores sobre os eleitos, a RV será a sanção/recompensa (normalmente eleitoral) pelo (in)cumprimento dessa contrapartida. Ao mesmo tempo, a responsividade não pode ser analisada de forma isolada do resto dos elementos constituintes da democracia. Como nota O’Donnell (2005, 3), a responsividade será tanto maior quanto mais estabelecido for o Estado de direito e, a jusante deste, a responsabilização, direitos e igualdade dos cidadãos. De igual modo, a responsividade contém – pelo menos, em termos teóricos – o princípio da igualdade que a democracia pressupõe (Rueschemeyer 2005, 47). Contudo, como frisa Wliezen (1995), a ligação entre preferências e políticas poderá não ser directa, funcionando antes num modelo «termostático». Assim, a democracia requer que a opinião pública seja capaz de identificar razoavelmente os outputs das políticas públicas. Quando\n\n213\n\nestas diferem das preferências dos cidadãos – ou, para usar a metáfora de Wliezen, quando a «temperatura» do quadro de políticas públicas difere da pretendida pelos cidadãos –, estes sinalizam a sua preferência para que a política seja ajustada às suas preferências, seja levando ao seu aumento ou diminuição. Trabalhos mais recentes têm confirmado este «modelo termostático» em diferentes contextos e tipos de políticas públicas (v., por exemplo, Franklin e Wliezen 1997 e Jennings 2009), embora este seja mediado também pelos quadros institucionais (Wliezen e Soroka 2012). Ao mesmo tempo, podemos conceber a existência de interacções mais complexas nos fluxos de responsividade – com efeito, se é verdade que as políticas públicas podem ser responsivas à opinião pública, também não é de excluir a possibilidade de a opinião pública ser moldada pelas políticas públicas aprovadas pelos decisores políticos. Os resultados de Hakhverdian (2012) mostram que – pelo menos, no caso do Reino Unido – as políticas públicas são sobretudo responsivas às preferências dos cidadãos, com uma relação menos clara – e com efeitos distintos, consoante a popularidade dos governantes. Ao mesmo tempo, importa também notar que existem desafios na análise e avaliação que pode ser feita da responsividade. Por um lado, não é fácil identificar quais são as verdadeiras «preferências» dos cidadãos; depois, mesmo que os governos conheçam as preferências dos cidadãos, permanece um dilema: a que preferências devem os políticos atender – às preferências de curto ou de longo prazo dos cidadãos?; e last but not least, constrangimentos de natureza económica e financeira, como os défices públicos, podem limitar a responsividade dos governos (Bing ham Powell 2005, 66-67). Bingham Powell (2005) identifica quatro etapas e três elos na cadeia da responsividade política. Todos estes elementos actuam de forma interligada num processo contínuo e dinâmico de criação de políticas que respondem às necessidades e preferências dos cidadãos. Os elos – estruturação de escolhas, agregação institucional e implementação de políticas públicas – fazem a ligação entre as etapas: preferências dos cidadãos, comportamento eleitoral, selecção dos governantes e outcomes das políticas. David Easton (1968) concebe o sistema político como um sistema fluido em permanente interacção com o meio ambiente, com o qual mantém trocas constantes. O sistema político organiza-se em termos de inputs e outputs, isto é, a um conjunto de exigências e necessidades dos cidadãos, o sistema político – partidos, governos, actores e instituições políticas, em geral – procurará corresponder através de um conjunto de acções e decisões políticas que tenham em consideração os interesses contratualizados\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n214\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\ncom os cidadãos. Por seu turno, os outputs da actividade do sistema político, quando interagem com o meio ambiente (outcomes), desencadeando novas exigências por parte dos cidadãos, completam o processo, produzem feedback, conferindo-lhe um carácter circular. Na concepção de Easton, em que «[...] um sistema político é apenas uma maneira de converter certos tipos de inputs em outputs» (Easton 1968, 154), a estruturação de escolhas assume-se como um elemento fundamental na formação de inputs, que são incorporados no sistema político através da agregação institucional para posteriormente serem convertidos em outputs sob a forma da implementação de políticas públicas que se pretendem responsivas e que, por isso, visem as necessidades e exigências dos cidadãos. Ocorre a disfuncionalidade no sistema político sempre que este processo esteja comprometido. Tal poderá acontecer se algum dos elos que possibilitam os fluxos entre as componentes do sistema político estiver ameaçado. A heterogeneidade das preferências dos cidadãos (primeira etapa da cadeia de Powell) é, em si mesma, um obstáculo considerável. Quanto mais diversas forem as preferências e necessidades dos cidadãos, maior será a complexidade dos inputs que o sistema político receberá. Na estruturação dessas preferências em escolhas eleitorais coerentes pode surgir uma variedade de obstáculos. O controlo e manipulação de informação, a limitação de escolhas eleitorais, por exemplo, por via de uma oferta partidária que não se adeque às preferências dos cidadãos, e/ou a incoerência partidária são factores de constrangimento. Existem, contudo, condições que podem superar esses obstáculos, facilitando a estruturação de escolhas. Uma imprensa descomprometida e livre para informar os cidadãos da realidade, elevados índices de escolarização e uma redução das desigualdades sociais reflectem populações mais capazes de compreender as alternativas e os processos políticos. Por outro lado, é ainda indispensável existir uma oferta partidária «que torne possível aos cidadãos exprimirem as suas preferências» (Powell 2005, 64), abrangendo a sua multiplicidade de interesses e permitindo que se consubstanciem em escolhas partidárias coerentes. Reunindo essas condições, as preferências dos cidadãos serão manifestadas no seu comportamento eleitoral. Porém, a selecção dos governantes posterior ao acto eleitoral deve corresponder à efectiva agregação institucional dos comportamentos eleitorais, de modo a manter-se fiel às escolhas dos cidadãos. Distorções no sistema eleitoral, distorções entre o voto e o sistema executivo, governação por decreto, derrota de Condorcet winners ou vitória de Condorcet losers e casos de party switching, desrespeitando as expectativas dos eleitores, são algumas das subversões que\n\n215\n\npodem afectar o elo da agregação institucional. Neste aspecto, focando o caso português em específico, o sistema eleitoral e a respectiva proporcionalidade assumem particular importância. Uma vez eleitos os governantes, a partir das preferências dos cidadãos e das suas escolhas eleitorais, importa aferir em que medida os outcomes das suas políticas reflectem os inputs iniciais dos eleitores. O elo da implementação das políticas públicas faz a ligação entre estas duas últimas etapas. Neste ponto, problemas como condicionamentos internos (por exemplo, um défice demasiado elevado) ou externos (como um programa de ajustamento ou compromissos orçamentais europeus), corrupção ou incumprimento dos programas eleitorais podem pôr em causa a criação de políticas responsivas. Por sua vez, a capacidade burocrática, a par de uma eficaz responsabilização horizontal (RH) que envolva outros agentes políticos na fiscalização da implementação das políticas, é um factor que pode facilitar este elo.\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n216\n\nQuadro 8.1 – Principais componentes que condicionam os elos de responsividade política\n\nProblemas\n\nCondições de facilitação\n\nEstruturar escolhas\n\nControlo de informação\n\nLimitação de escolhas\n\nIncoerência partidária\n\nEducação; media\n\nLiberdade de imprensa\n\nCompetição partidária – estabilidade/alternância\n\nDiscurso nacional\n\nImplementação de políticas públicas\n\nCondicionamentos internos e externos\n\nCorrupção\n\nIncumprimentos programáticos\n\nResponsabilização partidária\n\nResponsabilização horizontal\n\nCapacidade burocrática\n\nAgregação institucional\n\nDistorção no sistema eleitoral\n\nDistorções entre o voto e o sistema executivo\n\nDerrota de Condorcet winners/vitória de Condorcet losers\n\nGovernação por decreto\n\nParty switching\n\nSistema eleitoral de representação proporcional\n\nCoerência partidária\n\nPolítica inclusiva\n\nFonte: Powell 2005, 68.\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\nAssim, «uma democracia de elevada qualidade é assegurada quando as estruturas institucionais fornecem incentivos de suporte aos elos de responsividade» (Powell 2005, 63). Por essa razão, torna-se pertinente uma análise detalhada das condições em que os elos de responsividade operam para aferir a qualidade da democracia em Portugal. No processo de estruturação de escolhas, a capacidade de os indivíduos recolherem, seleccionarem e interpretarem informação relevante é um factor fundamental para a tradução das suas preferências num comportamento eleitoral coerente com as mesmas e para uma participação em todo o processo da responsividade política. Com efeito, como frisa Wliezen (1995), a responsabilização política requer a informação razoável dos cidadãos sobre as políticas existentes, o que, por sua vez, pressupõe a capacidade dos cidadãos para adquirirem e compreenderem essa informação. Nesse sentido, fracos níveis de recursos cognitivos, ou elevados níveis de desigualdade podem operar como obstáculos à descodificação da informação, das mensagens políticas e diferentes alternativas partidárias, limitando a capacidade dos cidadãos para recolherem e processarem informação que se consubstancie em escolhas políticas decididas conscientemente. Sem ambição de apresentar um quadro completo nesses dois domínios sociais, gostaríamos de fazer referência a alguns indicadores sobre a situação nessa área. Em relação aos recursos cognitivos, Portugal encontra-se claramente aquém da média da União Europeia (UE-27), embora tenha havido melhorias significativas na última década. Dados do Eurostat para o ano de 2011 (quadro 8.2) mostram que 36,2% da população portuguesa tem uma escolaridade acima do nível básico (3.º ciclo), valor que revela índices de escolaridade substancialmente abaixo da média europeia (70% para os países da UE-27). No entanto, se recuarmos ao ano de 2000, os valores eram de 21,1% para Portugal e 62,2% para a UE-27, o que representa uma aproximação de 7 pontos percentuais relativamente à média europeia. Tal reflecte uma evolução positiva em relação ao número de portugueses que concluíram o ensino secundário e superior, com um aumento de 7 e 8,1 pontos percentuais, respectivamente. Assim, no decorrer desta década constata-se um aumento global dos níveis de escolaridade em Portugal, o que reflecte uma evolução substancial, embora ainda assim insuficiente para equiparar os níveis de escolaridade de Portugal à média europeia (UE-27). No que diz respeito às desigualdades, Portugal era em 2010 um país com um coeficiente de Gini de 0,337, valor bastante superior à média da UE-27 ( 0,305), sendo por isso o quarto país mais desigual do espaço eu 217\n\nropeu. Porém, se recuarmos a 2000, o valor era de 0,36, o que fazia de Portugal o país mais desigual da então UE-15.2\n\nNem só ao nível da criação de uma estrutura de oportunidades para a participação poderá existir limitação de escolhas. Esta também se pode verificar por via do controlo do acesso à informação e do respectivo conteúdo. Assim, a liberdade de imprensa é um elemento central não só para a estruturação de escolhas e, por conseguinte, para a responsividade, mas também para a própria democracia. O Freedom of press index (Freedom House) avalia o grau de liberdade de imprensa de 197 países com base numa análise dos eventos significativos neste domínio ocorridos no respectivo ano. Neste ranking, com 17 pontos, Portugal ocupa actualmente a 16.ª posição a nível mundial e a 14.ª no seio da Europa ocidental, sendo considerado um país com uma imprensa livre. No entanto, esta é uma classificação que tem vindo a deteriorar-se ao longo da última década: até 2006 a pontuação de Portugal era de 0 pontos (numa escala em que 0 corresponde ao máximo de liberdade e 100 ao mínimo de liberdade de imprensa), passando mais tarde a 14 (2007), 16 (2008) e 17 pontos (2011). Para esse agravamento contribuíram acontecimentos como a apreensão de computadores a jornalistas por ordem judicial, rejeitando o pedido de protecção das fontes (2006),3\n\nas alterações ao estatuto do jornalista (2007/8), que passou a obrigar os profissionais a revelarem as suas fontes confidenciais perante ordem judicial e a permitir a reutilização do seu trabalho por empregadores e clientes nos trinta dias seguintes à data da sua publicação,4 a multa aplicada ao semanário Sol por desrespeito a uma ordem judicial que impedia a\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n218\n\nQuadro 8.2 –Níveis de escolaridade em Portugal e na UE-27 (2000, 2005 e 2011) (percentagem)\n\nEnsino básico (3.º ciclo) Ensino secundário Ensino superior\n\n2000 2005 2011 2000 2005 2011 2000 2005 2011\n\nPortugal 78,9 72,5 63,8 13,6 16,4 20,6 7,5 11,1 15,6 UE-27 37,8 34,1 30,0 45,1 46,2 46,4 17,1 19,6 23,6 Evolução Portugal –15,1 +7,0 +8,1 Evolução UE-27 –7,8 +1,3 +6,5\n\nFonte: Eurostat.\n\n2 Sobre o tema da desigualdade, v. o estudo recente de Carlos Farinha Rodrigues para a FFMS, disponível em http://www.ffms.pt/estudo/19/desigualdade-em-portugal. 3 V. http://en.rsf.org/portugal-court-rejects-journalists-appeal-26-04-2006,16881.html. 4 V. http://www.jornalistas.eu/?n=5234.\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\npublicação de escutas telefónicas (2010)5 e o caso que envolveu o vicepresidente do PS, Ricardo Rodrigues, que se apoderou dos gravadores de dois jornalistas que à altura o entrevistavam (2010).6\n\nEstes mesmos acontecimentos tiveram efeitos noutro índice destinado a medir as violações à liberdade de imprensa, o Press Freedom Index, da Reporters without Borders. Também neste índice a classificação portuguesa sofreu um declínio na última década devido aos casos que acabámos de descrever e, se em 2002 Portugal surgia como o 7.º país melhor posicionado, actualmente é o 33.º num total de 179. Conclui-se, portanto, que Portugal tem um regime de imprensa livre de censura, sem limitações significativas desta parte ao nível da estruturação de escolhas. Contudo, a tendência tem sido para uma crescente descida da classificação ao longo da última década, o que sugere uma relativa deterioração das condições em que a prática jornalística tem sido desenvolvida. Ao nível da limitação de escolhas por via dos baixos níveis de recursos cognitivos, bem como das desigualdades, Portugal encontra-se ainda manifestamente aquém da média da UE-27, mas com uma tendência global no sentido de uma aproximação progressiva. Sabemos que é extremamente difícil traçar uma relação directa entre níveis de recursos cognitivos, desigualdades e participação, na medida em que outros factores, tais como a existência de partidos políticos e organizações sociais mobilizadas, podem influenciar também a qualidade e o nível da mesma. Mesmo assim, julgamos que este exercício é útil, na medida em que serve para contextualizar as atitudes medidas pelo inquérito que analisamos abaixo.\n\nAgregação institucional\n\nO comportamento eleitoral dos cidadãos reflecte-se na selecção dos governantes por intermédio do segundo elo da responsividade política, a agregação institucional. Vários problemas podem ser identificados neste elo, subvertendo uma correcta ligação entre as duas fases. Não se registando em Portugal episódios de governação por decreto, party switching, derrota de Condorcet winners ou vitória de Condorcet losers – o que constitui uma mais-valia para Portugal no que respeita à agregação institucional –, a análise recai principalmente sobre o sistema eleitoral português e eventuais distorções na sua proporcionalidade.\n\n219\n\n5 V. http://en.rsf.org/portugal-judicial-harassment-results-in-17-08-2010,38160.html. 6 http://www.publico.pt/Pol%C3%ADtica/ricardo-rodrigues-apropriouse-de-dois-gravadores-de-jornalistas-da-sabado_1435720.\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n220\n\nOs sistemas de representação proporcional agregam institucionalmente os comportamentos eleitorais de acordo com a proporção (aproximada) dos votos obtidos por todos os partidos. Ao regerem-se segundo as escolhas eleitorais da globalidade do eleitorado, e não tanto em torno das preferências do votante mediano, reflectem de forma menos centrípeta a diversidade do mesmo, assim traduzindo mais fielmente a sua dispersão ideológica. Hug e Martin demonstram que «nos sistemas maioritários os deputados eleitos estão, em média, mais próximos das preferências do votante mediano do que nos sistemas de representação proporcional. Assim, os sistemas de representação proporcional levam a que os deputados estejam muito mais distribuídos em termos ideológicos do que nos sistemas maioritários» (2012, 193). Ainda assim, os sistemas de representação proporcional, em particular o português, não atingem uma representação proporcionalmente perfeita. Portugal possui um sistema eleitoral de representação proporcional de lista com base no método d’Hondt, modalidade tida como desfavorável aos pequenos partidos porque tende a inibir a fragmentação partidária, podendo fomentar a desproporcionalidade (Gallagher 1991, 34-35). No entanto, segundo um estudo recente com enfoque na realidade portuguesa, «o sistema português apresenta uma desproporcionalidade relativamente elevada em termos comparativos, mas a redução da fragmentação do sistema partidário não é muito grande, porque o voto é já comparativamente muito concentrado nos dois maiores partidos» (Freire et al. 2008, 31). O facto de Portugal se situar acima da média dos sistemas de representação proporcional de lista, no que toca ao nível de desproporcionalidade médio (índice dos quadrados mínimos) 7 para os anos de 1970-2007 (figura 8.1), representa uma distorção à proporcionalidade que se fica a dever não tanto à natureza do próprio sistema – que, por ser de representação proporcional, como defende Powell (2005), em teoria, favorece a responsividade –, mas sobretudo à dimensão reduzida de vários dos círculos eleitorais. Do ponto de vista institucional, em particular no que respeita à proporcionalidade do sistema eleitoral, vemos que Portugal não é, neste domínio, um sistema político com impedimentos substanciais à responsividade. De facto, embora seja certo que a reforma do sistema eleitoral\n\n7 Este índice é o least-squares index de Gallagher, calculado a partir da seguinte fórmula: , onde vi e si são a proporção do voto e dos mandatos para cada partido, respectivamente. O índice varia de 0 a 100, com 0 a indicar uma proporcionalidade absoluta.\n\nLSq = [ 1 2Σ (vi – si)2]\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\n(Lobo et al. 2009) foi posta no centro do debate sobre a reforma do sistema político já há algumas décadas, o debate tem-se centrado na questão da proximidade dos eleitos aos eleitores e na capacidade que os eleitores teriam de influenciar a escolha dos deputados. A questão da necessidade do aumento da proporcionalidade é raramente discutida neste contexto.\n\nImplementação de políticas\n\nO último elo lida com a qualidade dos outputs da actividade dos governantes eleitos: a implementação de políticas públicas. Estabelece a ligação entre os políticos, as políticas desenvolvidas e os respectivos resultados em articulação com as necessidades e preferências dos cidadãos. Tem como principais subversões os condicionamentos que se impõem à actividade política, nomeadamente a corrupção e o incumprimento dos programas de governo. Neste plano importa aferir também a capacidade burocrática do governo enquanto entrave à corrupção e condição facilitadora do desenvolvimento de políticas que exprimem as preferências dos cidadãos.\n\n221\n\nFigura 8.1 – Nível médio de desproporcionalidade (IQM) (1970-2007)\n\nFonte: Freire et al. 2008, 28:\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nHolanda\n\nChipre\n\nSuíça\n\nFinlândia\n\nItália\n\nRoménia\n\nLuxemburgo\n\nMédia RP1\n\nPortugal\n\nBélgica\n\nLetónia\n\nEslováquia\n\nRep. Checa\n\nPolónia\n\nEspanha\n\nBulgária\n\nUma dimensão relevante neste âmbito prende-se com a RH, que consiste num mecanismo eficaz de controlo dos governos, nomeadamente na área da implementação das políticas públicas. Esta pode ser entendida como:\n\nA existência de agências estatais que têm o direito e o poder legal, e que estão efectivamente dispostas e capacitadas, para tomar acções que vão desde a supervisão rotineira a sanções criminais ou impeachment relativamente às acções ou emissões de outros agentes ou agências do Estado [O’Donnell 1999, 38].\n\nSe a RV se exerce com maior impacto por parte dos cidadãos nos momentos eleitorais, a RH tem o potencial de implicar outros agentes políticos no processo de supervisão contínua da actividade governamental durante o período da legislatura. Como frisa Powell (2005, 62), «Liberdade, igualdade, RV e RH e regime de Estado de direito contribuem directamente para a qualidade da democracia». De igual modo, estas características também facilitam a responsividade democrática. Por esse motivo, debruçamo-nos de seguida sobre os indicadores que avaliam a capacidade burocrática e de execução dos governos portugueses. Uma ineficácia a estes níveis, aliada a elevados índices de corrupção, representaria um condicionamento significativo ao nível da implementação das políticas públicas, com consequências adversas para a qualidade da democracia, em geral, e a sua responsividade política, em específico. Os dados existentes sugerem que os portugueses percepcionam a existência de RH. O inquérito às atitudes dos portugueses sobre a qualidade da democracia realizado pelo ICS em 2011 questiona os indivíduos sobre a capacidade que reconhecem aos agentes de RH em Portugal. Os resultados indicam que o agente com maior capacidade reconhecida pelos indivíduos é o Presidente da República (52% reconhecem-lhe total ou bastante capacidade), seguido da UE (39%), da Assembleia da República (38%), do Provedor de Justiça (28%) e dos meios de comunicação social (26%). Qual a capacidade burocrática no caso português? Os World Bank governance indicators ajudam a responder a esta questão. A partir das percepções e experiências de cidadãos, empresários e especialistas nos sectores público, privado e não governamental, estes indicadores avaliam a qualidade de vários aspectos de governança, incidindo sobre um total de seis dimensões com relevância para a capacidade burocrática: voz e res Marina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n222\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\n223\n\nponsabilidade,8 estabilidade política/ausência de violência,9 eficácia do governo,10 qualidade normativa,11 regime de Estado de direito12 e controlo da corrupção.13 A figura 8.2 apresenta os valores para Portugal nestas seis dimensões nas avaliações da última década. Globalmente, Portugal regista valores positivos para todos os indicadores, embora abaixo do percentil 80 em metade destes em 2011, nomeadamente no que toca à estabilidade política/ausência de violência, à eficácia do governo e à qualidade normativa. Numa perspectiva longitu 8 Mede até que ponto os cidadãos de um país são capazes de participar na escolha do seu governo, bem como na liberdade de expressão, na liberdade de associação e nos meios de comunicação livres. 9 Mede a probabilidade de o governo vir a ser desestabilizado por métodos inconstitucionais ou violentos, inclusive o terrorismo. 10 Mede a qualidade dos serviços públicos, a competência da administração pública e a respectiva independência das pressões políticas e a qualidade da formulação das políticas. 11 Mede a capacidade do governo para desenvolver políticas e normas sólidas que habilitem e promovam o desenvolvimento do sector privado. 12 Mede até que ponto os agentes confiam nas regras da sociedade e agem de acordo com elas, inclusive a qualidade da execução de contratos e os direitos de propriedade, a polícia e os tribunais, além da probabilidade de crime e violência. 13 Mede até que ponto o poder público é exercido em benefício privado, inclusive as pequenas e grandes formas de corrupção, além do condicionamento do Estado pelas elites e pelos interesses privados.\n\nFigura 8.2 – World Bank governance indicators para Portugal (2002, 2006 e 2011)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n85 81 83 Controlo da corrupção\n\nEficácia do governo\n\nEstabilidade política/ausência de violência\n\nQualidade normativa\n\nRegime de Estado de direito\n\nVoz e responsabilidade\n\n2002 2006\n\n70 80 90 100\n\n87 77 79\n\n96 79 70\n\n87 81 74\n\n88 80 82\n\n92 90 85\n\n2011\n\ndinal, fica evidente uma tendência de descida da cotação ao longo da última década comum a todas as seis dimensões, que poderá reflectir um declínio da qualidade da democracia. Somando as quebras dos seis indicadores ao longo da última década, Portugal perdeu um total acumulado de 11,7% da sua cotação cumulativa, que baixou de 534,5 (num máximo de 600) em 2002 para 472 em 2011. Atentando nos indicadores mais relevantes para medir a responsividade, nomeadamente a eficácia do governo, qualidade regulatória, regime de Estado de direito e controlo de corrupção numa perspectiva comparativa, chegamos a algumas conclusões gerais. A eficácia do governo, examinada na figura 8.3, relaciona-se com a qualidade dos serviços públicos, a competência da administração pública e respectiva independência das pressões políticas e a qualidade da formulação das políticas. Entre os oito países analisados, Portugal tem o segundo pior índice de eficácia de governo em 2011. Esta posição relativa remonta a 2002, mas na última década registou-se uma quebra significativa não\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n224\n\nFigura 8.3 – World Bank governance indicators: eficácia do governo (2002, 2006 e 2011)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nAlemanha\n\nBélgica\n\nEspanha\n\nFinlândia\n\nFrança\n\nGrécia\n\nHolanda\n\nPortugal\n\n2002 2006\n\n70 80 90 100\n\n2011\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\napenas em Portugal, mas comum aos países da Europa do Sul, manifestando-se com particular incidência no caso espanhol. Numa escala de 0 a 100, em que a Finlândia tem o valor máximo, os países da Europa do Sul ocupam as três últimas posições entre os países observados, com a Grécia a destacar-se negativamente, ao ser o único país abaixo do percentil 70, ficando mais de 10 pontos percentuais abaixo de Portugal. A qualidade regulatória, apresentada na figura 8.4, diz respeito à capacidade do governo para desenvolver políticas e normas sólidas que habilitem e promovam o desenvolvimento do sector privado. Na última década, Portugal registou um declínio gradual superior a 10 pontos percentuais no que concerne a esta dimensão, encontrando-se actualmente pouco acima dos valores da Grécia, o pior classificado dos oito países europeus aqui comparados. Também nesta dimensão a quebra é partilhada pelos três países da Europa do Sul. A Alemanha, a Finlândia e a Holanda permanecem os únicos países acima do percentil 90.\n\n225\n\nFigura 8.4 – World Bank governance indicators: qualidade regulatória (2002, 2006 e 2011)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nAlemanha\n\nBélgica\n\nEspanha\n\nFinlândia\n\nFrança\n\nGrécia\n\nHolanda\n\nPortugal\n\n2002 2006\n\n70 80 90 100\n\n2011\n\nO regime de Estado de direito, avaliado na figura 8.5, mede até que ponto os agentes confiam nas regras da sociedade e agem de acordo com elas, incluindo a avaliação da qualidade da execução de contratos e os direitos de propriedade, a polícia e os tribunais, além da probabilidade de ocorrência de crimes e violência. Relativamente a esta dimensão, na última década metade dos países aqui analisados piorou os seus índices: os três países da Europa do Sul e a Alemanha. Portugal foi o país que mais piorou nesta dimensão, embora ainda esteja a uma grande distância da Grécia, que quebrou sobretudo a partir de 2006. A avaliação, no que diz respeito ao controlo da corrupção, é apresentada na figura 8.6. Esta visa medir até que ponto o poder público é exercido em benefício privado, inclusive as pequenas e grandes formas de corrupção, além do condicionamento do Estado pelas elites e pelos interesses privados. Nesta dimensão de responsividade, cinco países situam-se acima do percentil 90. Dos restantes – os países da Europa do Sul –\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n226\n\nFigura 8.5 – World Bank governance indicators: regime de Estado de direito (2002, 2006 e 2011)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nAlemanha\n\nBélgica\n\nEspanha\n\nFinlândia\n\nFrança\n\nGrécia\n\nHolanda\n\nPortugal\n\n2002 2006\n\n70 80 90 100\n\n2011\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\nPortugal e a Espanha apresentam valores muito semelhantes, tendo este último descido cerca de 10 pontos percentuais ao longo da última década. Os dados para a Grécia revelam uma realidade completamente à parte da portuguesa e da espanhola. O valor de 55,9 no controlo da corrupção torna a Grécia mais distante da Espanha (o segundo pior classificado) do que a Espanha do topo da escala. No entanto, tal deve-se em grande parte à queda abrupta que se registou a partir de 2006. Da leitura dos indicadores comparados fica clara a prevalência da Finlândia e da Holanda como os países com melhor prestação no conjunto dos índices sobre a qualidade da governança. Surgem numa segunda linha a Alemanha, a Bélgica e a França, com este último país a coincidir com a Espanha em alguns indicadores. A Espanha, Portugal e a Grécia, os três países da Europa do Sul, revelam índices inferiores e as evoluções mais negativas ao longo dos últimos anos. Contudo, o caso grego distingue-se qualitativamente por ser constantemente o que apresenta pior per 227\n\nFigura 8.6 – World Bank governance indicators: controlo da corrupção (2002, 2006 e 2011)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nAlemanha\n\nBélgica\n\nEspanha\n\nFinlândia\n\nFrança\n\nGrécia\n\nHolanda\n\nPortugal\n\n2002 2006\n\n70 80 90 100\n\n2011\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n228\n\nformance e a uma distância substancial face aos restantes, como acontece no caso do controlo da corrupção. Na medida em que envolve a alocação de recursos do Estado para outros fins, a corrupção é, de facto, um factor inibidor da implementação de políticas públicas e, portanto, um obstáculo à concretização dos programas eleitorais. A entidade internacional de combate à corrupção, Transparency International, desenvolve anualmente o índice de percepção da corrupção (CPI), um indicador agregado que combina diferentes fontes de informação, classificando os países de acordo com a percepção sobre o fenómeno da corrupção no sector público. Este índice tem por base diferentes avaliações e inquéritos de opinião realizados por instituições independentes. Utilizamos aqui este índice numa perspectiva longitudinal e comparativa, abrangendo os anos de 2002, 2007 e 2012 e os mesmos países da análise antecedente (figura 8.7). Os dados da figura 8.7 vêm em linha com as conclusões do indicador de corrupção do World Bank. Aliás, as posições relativas dos países são idênticas. Numa escala de 0 (altamente corrupto) a 10 (muito honesto), a Grécia, com uma classificação de 3,6, ocupa a última posição entre os\n\nFigura 8.7 – Índice de percepções de corrupção (CPI)\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nPortugal Espanha Grécia Alemanha\n\nFrança Finlândia Holanda Bélgica\n\n2002 2007 2012\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\n229\n\npaíses analisados, invertendo a tendência de melhoria até 2007 e regredindo face a uma década atrás. Portugal regista para 2012 sensivelmente o mesmo valor que em 2002, apesar do ligeiro progresso que se verificava em 2007, situando-se a seguir à Grécia, mas distanciando-se em quase 3 valores. Ao longo da última década, a Espanha, a Grécia, a Holanda e a Finlândia tiveram um declínio de magnitude semelhante, embora estes dois últimos países mantenham as posições de liderança de 2002. As únicas subidas no índice são os casos da Alemanha e da Bélgica. No ranking mundial de 183 países, a Finlândia é 1.º, a Holanda 9.º, a Alemanha 13.º, a Bélgica 16.º, a França 22.º, a Espanha 30.º, Portugal 33.º e a Grécia 94.º Em termos globais, os dados aqui apresentados para a implementação de políticas públicas indicam que Portugal teve uma prestação intermédia quando comparado com os restantes países da Europa do Sul. Quando incluímos no âmbito da análise os restantes países europeus abrangidos, torna-se evidente o desfasamento dos países da Europa do Sul, no qual Portugal se inclui, em relação a todos os indicadores de implementação de políticas públicas. Sob o olhar longitudinal, importa ainda referir a tendência comum para uma queda da avaliação no caso português em todos os indicadores referentes à implementação de políticas públicas. Com efeito, embora Portugal apresente valores razoáveis, na década transacta todos os indicadores pioraram no contexto português. Olhando agora para os vários elos de responsividade política de forma global, parece ser legítimo afirmar que não demonstram nenhuma melhoria significativa ao longo da última década. Entre os três elos identificámos tendências contraditórias: ligeiras melhorias na estruturação de escolhas; ausência de problemas de party switching, governação por decreto e derrotas de Condorcet winners e vitórias de Condorcet losers, mas existência de desproporcionalidade acima da média, embora estável, no que toca à agregação institucional; grandes condicionalismos internos e externos, alguma incapacidade ao nível da RH e deterioração da capacidade democrática no domínio da implementação de políticas públicas. O mesmo sucede ao nível dos próprios indicadores que os compõem – por exemplo, no elo da estruturação de escolhas a tendência aponta no sentido de uma melhoria ao nível dos recursos cognitivos e da redução das desigualdades económicas, mas para uma degradação das condições em que é exercida a liberdade de imprensa em Portugal. Este é o panorama pouco animador do contexto institucional, tal como os índices de que dispomos nos proporcionam e ajudam a contextualizar a análise da perspectiva dos cidadãos que de seguida é efectuada.\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n230\n\nResponsividade política: perspectiva dos cidadãos\n\nPara além dos dados objectivos e avaliações externas sobre as condições actuais dos elos de responsividade política, podemos averiguar as percepções dos portugueses sobre a responsividade. Para o efeito, recorremos a dados do inquérito às atitudes dos portugueses sobre a qualidade da democracia de Julho de 2011 e, sempre que possível, adoptando a mesma perspectiva longitudinal e comparativa. A satisfação com a democracia é um indicador frequentemente utilizado para medir a responsividade (para uma análise deste e de outros indicadores, v. Powell 2005, 72-75). Os dados da figura 8.8 demonstram-nos uma crescente insatisfação dos portugueses com o funcionamento da democracia. Em nove anos (2002-2011), a percentagem de portugueses insatisfeitos (pouco ou nada satisfeitos) com o funcionamento da democracia aumentou 20 pontos percentuais. Em 2011, 67% dos portugueses estavam insatisfeitos com o funcionamento da democracia. O maior agravamento na insatisfação dos portugueses deu-se no período mais curto analisado, ou seja, nos últimos dois anos (2009-2011), o que é elucidativo das opiniões dos portugueses sobre o passado recente do funcionamento da democracia. A responsividade política, do ponto de vista individual, é um conceito multidimensional que pode ser medido a dois níveis. O primeiro são as percepções sobre a responsividade da classe política,14 o segundo são as percepções sobre a responsividade do sistema político.15\n\n14 Neste inquérito essas percepções são medidas através das seguintes perguntas: «Agora vou-lhe ler algumas frases sobre a capacidade e vontade que os políticos em Portugal demonstram para responder aos problemas das pessoas. Gostava que me dissesse se está muito de acordo, de acordo, em desacordo ou muito em desacordo com as seguintes afirmações: ‘as decisões políticas no nosso país favorecem sobretudo os grandes interesses económicos’; ‘em Portugal, os decisores políticos são pouco responsabilizados pelas políticas que implementam’; ‘os compromissos assumidos perante a União Europeia fazem com que os políticos portugueses não tenham autonomia para defender os interesses dos cidadãos nacionais’.» 15 Neste inquérito essas percepções são medidas através das seguintes perguntas: «Agora vou-lhe ler algumas frases sobre a capacidade e vontade que os políticos em Portugal demonstram para responder aos problemas das pessoas. Gostava que me dissesse se está muito de acordo, de acordo, em desacordo ou muito em desacordo com as seguintes afirmações: ‘os políticos preocupam-se apenas com os seus próprios interesses’; ‘os políticos não se interessam pelo que pessoas como eu pensam’; ‘os políticos levam os interesses dos cidadãos em conta na hora de tomarem decisões»; «no nosso país, os políticos tentam resolver os problemas dos cidadãos’.»\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\n231\n\nA figura 8.9 reflecte a avaliação dos portugueses face a estes dois níveis de responsividade política. Assim, os três primeiros indicadores dizem respeito à dimensão da responsividade do sistema político e os quatro últimos à responsividade da classe política. Destaca-se a predominância das avaliações negativas sobre as positivas, que atingem, no melhor dos casos, os 27%. Ambas as dimensões são avaliadas de forma aproximadamente negativa por parte dos inquiridos. «Os políticos preocupam-se apenas com os seus próprios interesses» é a variável que obtém mais avaliações negativas (81%) e uma menor percentagem de avaliações positivas (4%). Sublinha-se ainda que 81% dos inquiridos entendem que «as decisões políticas no nosso país favorecem sobretudo os grandes interesses económicos» e 79% consideram que «em Portugal os decisores políticos não são responsabilizados pelas políticas que implementam». É na avaliação da responsividade da classe política que se encontra uma maior percentagem de avaliações positivas, embora mesmo assim francamente minoritária: 24% consideram que «os políticos levam os interesses dos cidadãos em conta na hora de tomarem decisões» e 27% concordam que «no nosso país, os políticos tentam resolver os problemas dos cidadãos». Estas avaliações positivas situam-se mais de 30 e 20 pontos percentuais abaixo das negativas, respectivamente.\n\nFigura 8.8 – Avaliação global 2002-2011: «Em que medida se sente satisfeito com o funcionamento da democracia em Portugal?» (percentagem)\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0 2002 2005 2009 2011\n\n6\n\n32 36 33 39\n\n47 44 40 32\n\n2 2 1\n\n15 18 26 28\n\nMuito satisfeito\n\nRazoavemente satisfeito\n\nPouco satisfeito\n\nNada satisfeito\n\nFonte: Inquéritos pós-eleitorais, ICS.\n\nFocando um indicador de responsividade da classe política em particular – «os políticos não se interessam pelo que as pessoas como pensam» – e observando a sua evolução longitudinal entre os anos de 2002 e 2011, fica uma vez mais patente a percepção de uma progressiva deterioração da responsividade política ao longo da última década, deixando antever um crescente distanciamento entre os interesses de políticos e eleitores na avaliação destes últimos.

Porém, apesar da sua posição relativa em perspectiva comparada, os valores de Portugal distam duas vezes mais do país melhor classificado (Dinamarca) do que do pior classificado (Bulgária). No intuito de averiguar a existência de relações estatisticamente significativas entre as percepções de responsividade política e as características sócio-demográficas e políticas dos indivíduos, procedemos à elaboração da análise apresentada no quadro 8.3. Nesta separamos a responsividade nos dois níveis acima delineados, classe política e sistema político. Das quatro variáveis sócio-demográficas testadas, duas apresentaram diferenças estatisticamente significativas, sugerindo um padrão atitudinal relativamente transversal à população portuguesa, embora com maior prevalência entre os inquiridos do Norte do país e os menos instruídos. Das variáveis afectas ao posicionamento político, o autoposicionamento na escala esquerda-direita apenas se mostrou significativo no que toca à responsividade da classe política, com a esquerda a fazer uma avaliação mais negativa. Os dados demonstram ainda que os indivíduos votantes em partidos fora do acordo com a troika fazem uma avaliação mais negativa da responsividade do sistema político. Por último, as atitudes políticas não têm, na sua maioria, correlação com a responsividade. A excepção são os indivíduos sem identificação partidária, que – como seria expectável – fazem uma avaliação mais negativa da responsividade da classe política. Os resultados parcialmente diferentes do quadro 8.3 em termos de responsividade da classe política e do sistema político sugerem que os indivíduos distinguem entre estas duas dimensões. Embora exista uma correlação estatisticamente significativa entre elas (coeficiente de correlação de Pearson = 0,221; sig. p = 0,000) – um resultado que é, de certo modo, inevitável –, os dados sugerem uma distinção na avaliação destas duas dimensões, distinção que é confirmada quando analisamos a sua correlação com a satisfação com a democracia. Com efeito, a correlação entre a satisfação com a democracia e a responsividade é estatisticamente significativa apenas no que concerne à responsividade da classe política. Mais, se desagregarmos as duas dimensões pelos respectivos indicadores que as compõem, verificamos que, para a responsividade da classe política, todos os indicadores são estatisticamente significativos (embora «os políticos levam os interesses dos cidadãos em conta na hora de tomarem decisões» em menor grau), enquanto para a responsividade do sistema político apenas existe correlação significativa (de forma fraca) com a questão da influência dos grandes interesses económicos, como se pode ver no quadro 8.4.\n\n235\n\nDe modo a analisar as determinantes da responsividade, quer em termos da classe política, quer do sistema político, procedemos a uma análise multivariada explicativa da responsividade política. As variáveis independentes são as utilizadas no quadro 8.3 (excepto o «voto nos partidos do governo» por efeitos de multicolinearidade) e as variáveis dependentes são os índices de responsividade. Para a responsividade da classe política identificamos dois preditores significativos: nível educacional (beta: 0,213; sig. p = 0,001) e região (Norte-Sul) (beta: 0,137; sig. p = 0,007), nos sentidos descritos anteriormente. Para a responsividade do sistema político apenas a região (Norte-Sul) é um preditor significativo (beta: 0,168; sig. p = 0,001). Em ambos os casos a variância explicada é relativamente baixa (responsividade da classe política: adj. R2 = 0,045; responsividade do sistema político: adj. R2 = 0,035), reforçando a conclusão de que a avaliação negativa da responsividade – quer da classe política, quer do sistema político – é transversal à população portuguesa.\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n236\n\nQuadro 8.4 – Correlatos da satisfação com a responsividade da classe política e do sistema político (r de Pearson)\n\nOs políticos não se interessam pelo que pessoas como eu pensam (–– ++)\n\nOs políticos preocupam-se apenas com os seus próprios interesses (–– ++)\n\nOs políticos levam os interesses dos cidadãos em conta na hora de tomarem decisões (–– ++)\n\nNo nosso país, os políticos tentam resolver os problemas dos cidadãos (–– ++)\n\nAs decisões políticas no nosso país favorecem sobretudo os grandes interesses económicos (–– ++)\n\nOs compromissos assumidos perante a União Europeia fazem com que os políticos portugueses não tenham autonomia para defender os interesses dos cidadãos nacionais (–– ++)\n\nEm Portugal, os decisores políticos são pouco responsabilizados pelas políticas que implementam (–– ++)\n\nSatisfação com a democracia (–– ++)\n\n0,126 **\n\n0,176 **\n\n0,070 *\n\n0,109 **\n\n0,071 *\n\n–0,005\n\n–0,002\n\nResponsividade da classe política Responsividade do sistema político\n\nNotas: * p < 0,05 (teste bicaudal); ** p < 0,01 (teste bicaudal).\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\nConclusões\n\nMario Draghi, presidente do Banco Central Europeu, afirmou, numa entrevista recente ao semanário Der Spiegel, que alguns «governos europeus ainda não se aperceberam de que perderam soberania há muito» (29 de Outubro de 2012). Esta frase demonstra que a crise económica não tem tido apenas efeitos na economia, mas poderá estar também a afectar o sistema político. O panorama delineado ao longo do capítulo demonstra isso mesmo. De facto, a primeira década do novo milénio é frequentemente descrita como uma «década perdida» em termos da economia portuguesa. Como os dados deste capítulo indicam, esta descrição parece ser extensível também à responsividade política, pelo menos em termos da avaliação dos cidadãos. Com efeito, os dados apontam para uma deterioração da avaliação que é feita da responsividade, quer em termos globais – a satisfação com a democracia declina 20 pontos percentuais entre 2002 e 2011 –, quer em dimensões mais específicas da responsividade (v., por exemplo, a queda de 15 pontos percentuais na proporção dos portugueses que consideram que os políticos se interessam pelas opiniões do cidadão comum). Assim, em 2011, o padrão de avaliação da responsividade política é marcadamente negativo: apenas um em cada três portugueses encontra-se satisfeito com o funcionamento da sua democracia e apenas 10% consideram que os políticos têm em conta as opiniões do cidadão comum. Como os dados deste capítulo ilustram, esta avaliação negativa é transversal à sociedade portuguesa, não sendo significativamente explicada pelas variáveis sócio-demográficas, de posicionamento político e de atitudes políticas examinadas. Portanto, respondendo às duas questões colocadas na introdução deste capítulo, podemos concluir que embora 80% dos votantes tenham votado em partidos que apoiaram o programa de ajuda financeira a Portugal, este voto não assegurou uma percepção positiva da responsividade política em Portugal. Pelo contrário. Em segundo lugar, os dados que apresentamos mostram cabalmente que a crise no relacionamento entre os eleitores e os eleitos é anterior ao rebentar da crise económico-financeira, a partir de 2008-2009. Todos os dados que coligimos anteriores a 2011 mostram quebras significativas na qualidade da relação entre os cidadãos e a política. Por isso, a crise agravou uma deterioração que estava já em curso. A triangulação dos dados do inquérito com outros dados aponta para uma deterioração muito mais rápida da avaliação dos portugueses do que as avaliações externas e os dados objectivos. Com efeito, retomando os dados mobilizados para cada um dos três elos da responsividade, o saldo\n\n237\n\nMarina Costa Lobo, Carlos Jalali e Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\n238\n\nglobal está longe de mostrar um declínio tão acentuado como na percepção dos portugueses. No primeiro elo, centrado na estruturação de escolhas, temos a coexistência de tendências ligeiramente negativas (liberdade de imprensa) com outras (ligeiramente) positivas (desigualdade, níveis educacionais); no segundo, relacionado com a agregação institucional, não emerge qualquer alteração substancial (o sistema eleitoral não se alterou, nem emerge um padrão de mudanças partidárias ou de governação por decreto); no terceiro elo (implementação de políticas públicas) as avaliações apontam para um declínio relativamente mitigado. As implicações deste padrão não são irrelevantes, sobretudo se considerarmos a reciprocidade que se pode gerar em termos de responsividade. Convém aqui recuperar a leitura habitual da democracia representativa enquanto relação de principal-agente. Os cidadãos são, no seu conjunto, o principal. Daí decorre a importância da responsividade, na medida em que os representantes políticos – os agentes desta relação – elaboram e implementam políticas que exprimem as preferências dos cidadãos. Este modelo sugere uma ligação hierárquica entre os cidadãos e os representantes, com os primeiros acima dos segundos. Contudo, a posição hierárquica dos cidadãos é, na realidade, dupla – têm o poder de escolher os seus agentes, mas estão também sujeitos às leis e políticas públicas que estes aprovarem. Com efeito, a democracia pressupõe representantes que são responsivos às preferências dos cidadãos; mas também cidadãos que são responsivos às leis e políticas públicas. Esta dupla posição dos cidadãos suscita a possibilidade de reciprocidade na relação de responsividade. Se os cidadãos não percepcionam os seus representantes como responsivos, podem reciprocar, tornando-se menos responsivos perante as leis e políticas públicas. Tal acarreta custos e dificuldades substanciais ao processo de governação. Recuperando a analogia de Dunsire (1993), a governação assemelha-se à condução de um automóvel. No processo de condução, a direcção de um veículo não depende unicamente do seu condutor. Na realidade, o movimento no volante de um automóvel desencadeia uma série de reacções em mecanismos internos do veículo – como, por exemplo, válvulas ou cilindros – que geram pressão sobre a barra do automóvel e levam as suas rodas a deslocarem-se na direcção pretendida. Se esses cilindros e válvulas não forem responsivos, o carro não reagirá às instruções do condutor. Da mesma forma, a implementação das decisões de um governo depende da aceitação de outros intervenientes, que são, em última análise, os cidadãos. Uma menor aceitação, inevitavelmente, dificulta o processo de governação.\n\nResponsividade política em Portugal: retrato de um processo de deterioração em curso\n\n239\n\nFica uma última questão sobre este «processo de deterioração em curso» que as avaliações e tendências marcadamente negativas identificadas neste capítulo podem suscitar – deverá ser equacionado um cenário de retrocesso democrático, com a actual democracia portuguesa a dar lugar a uma nova experiência não democrática? É nossa convicção que tal cenário permanece irrealista. Como Linz e Stepan (1996, 5-6) frisam, a consolidação da democracia ocorre quando a democracia se torna o «único jogo possível» (the only game in town) numa sociedade. Tendo em conta esta definição, não parece haver uma alteração – a democracia não perdeu esse estatuto, seja em termos atitudinais, comportamentais ou institucionais. Contudo, se a democracia permanece o «único jogo» em Portugal, os dados deste capítulo sugerem que é um jogo que – na avaliação da esmagadora maioria dos portugueses – está a ser muito mal jogado.\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nBeetham, D., et al. 2008.

Magalhães\n\nCapítulo 9\n\nGovernação eficaz e apoio à democracia\n\nIntrodução\n\nExiste uma longa tradição na investigação e pensamento políticos que defende que as instituições políticas e o seu funcionamento devem ser vistos como um reflexo dos valores e atitudes dos cidadãos. É uma tradição que remonta à obra Da Democracia na América, de Alexis de Tocqueville (2000 [1840]), e que tem encontrado um apoio empírico renovado nos trabalhos de Almond e Verba (1963), Putnam (1993) ou Fukuyama (1995), autores que se têm focado no papel da «cultura cívica», na «confiança interpessoal», no «capital social» e nos seus efeitos sobre os regimes políticos e o seu desempenho institucional. Esta abordagem à ligação entre as atitudes de massas e as instituições trata as primeiras como causas de mudança nas segundas. Deste modo, os «valores de auto-expressão», eles próprios originados pelo desenvolvimento sócio-económico e pelo aumento dos recursos cognitivos dos cidadãos, são vistos como causas de mudança de regime e de respeito pelos direitos civis e políticos (Inglehart e Welzel 2005), enquanto o apoio incondicional de massas à democracia («legitimidade democrática») tem sido considerado uma condição para a consolidação e estabilidade da democracia (Gunther et al. 2007; Diamond 1999). No entanto, existe uma tradição igualmente longa na investigação e pensamento políticos que sugere que as atitudes, crenças e preferências dos cidadãos em relação às instituições e regimes políticos devem também ser consideradas consequências – em vez de apenas causas – do funcionamento dessas instituições e regimes. Num conjunto de trabalhos escritos desde a década de 50, David Easton (1953, 1957, 1965a, 1965b e 1975) teorizou que as atitudes e as acções de apoio a um regime político devem ser tratadas não só como inputs relevantes no sistema político, mas também como resultado dos efeitos dos outputs do sistema, ou seja,\n\ndas decisões políticas e das políticas públicas. Da mesma forma, outros dois gigantes da ciência política do século XX, Seymour Martin Lipset e Robert Dahl, defendiam que a legitimidade dos regimes políticos e as crenças básicas sobre a autoridade podem ser afectadas pela «eficácia» dos governos, entendida como «o desempenho real de um sistema político, na medida em que satisfaz as funções básicas governativas, tal como definidas pelas expectativas da maioria dos membros de uma sociedade» (Lipset 1959, 86), ou, simplificando, como a «capacidade [do governo] em lidar eficazmente com problemas palpáveis» (Dahl 1971, 147). Este capítulo reconhece esta segunda tradição e testa empiricamente hipóteses que advêm da mesma. Especificamente, testa a hipótese de que, independentemente da forma como os factores sociais e económicos afectam as atitudes e crenças fundamentais dos cidadãos sobre as instituições políticas, a eficácia governativa, entendida como a qualidade da formulação e implementação das políticas públicas, molda de forma importante as crenças e atitudes de massas, em particular as atitudes em relação aos regimes. As pessoas que vivem em regimes democráticos em que a qualidade da elaboração de políticas é alta tenderão a dar maior apoio à democracia e a rejeitar alternativas autocráticas. Por oposição, quando a ineficácia é dominante, o apoio democrático será prejudicado. Uma implicação adicional consiste no facto de a relação entre a governação eficaz e o apoio à democracia poder por vezes ser negativa: as autocracias em que a qualidade da formulação e implementação das políticas é alta tenderão a ser caracterizadas por níveis mais baixos de apoio de massas à democracia como regime.\n\nGovernação, democracia e atitudes de massas\n\nOutputs e apoio específico\n\nO que define a «democracia» e como deve ser distinguida de outros tipos de regime, é uma discussão antiga na teoria política e na ciência política. Contudo, é relativamente claro que a democracia e a governação eficaz não se sobrepõem, quer conceptualmente, quer empiricamente. Estudos que operacionalizam os conceitos de «governação» e «democracia» tendem a confirmar a heterogeneidade interna dos regimes democráticos neste sentido (Montinola e Jackman 2002; Sung 2004; Bäck e Hadenius 2008; Charron e Lapuente 2010). Numa revisão ampla dos dados disponíveis, Holmberg, Rothstein e Nasiritousi (2009, 138) concluem que, «empiricamente, não existe nenhuma relação directa entre o estabelecimento\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\n242\n\nGovernação eficaz e apoio à democracia\n\nde uma democracia representativa eleitoral e a QoG (quality of government) no exercício do poder público» (v. também Rothstein e Teorell 2008). Se as democracias variam em termos da qualidade da sua governação, é provável que tal variação provoque, ela própria, diferenças nas avaliações feitas pelos cidadãos sobre o desempenho da democracia. Essa expectativa decorre directamente da famosa teorização de David Easton sobre a natureza do chamado apoio específico. Easton concebe-o como dirigido às «percepções das decisões, políticas, acções, expressões ou estilo geral das [...] autoridades (Easton 1975, 437) e por isso susceptível aos efeitos dos outputs do sistema político (Easton 1957, 385, e 1965, 126). Quando as políticas são «percepcionadas pelos membros como indo ao encontro das suas exigências à medida que estas vão surgindo ou por antecipação» (Easton 1965b, 343), o apoio específico aumenta. Quando isso não acontece, o apoio específico diminui. A maioria das tentativas de testar a noção de que os outputs do sistema produzem efeitos sobre as avaliações do desempenho do regime contornaram a questão difícil de como medir os atributos dos outputs das políticas e passaram directamente para a relação entre os resultados e o apoio. Deste modo, muitos estudos mostram que a «satisfação com o funcionamento da democracia» é afectada pelas percepções subjectivas de desempenho económico (Anderson e Guillory 1997; Rose et al. 1998; Mishler e Rose 2001; Wagner et al. 2003; Chu et al. 2008; Thomassen e van der Kolk 2009) ou por indicadores económicos objectivos desse desempenho, como o crescimento do PIB (Anderson 1998; Rose et al. 1998). No entanto, alguma investigação demonstra que, independentemente de ser afectada por indicadores subjectivos ou objectivos de desempenho económico, a satisfação dos cidadãos com a democracia também está relacionada com indicadores que conseguem captar melhor as características dos «outputs do sistema». Deste modo, Rose, Mishler e Haerpfer (1998) mostram que medidas agregadas de corrupção estão relacionadas com melhores avaliações de «como as coisas estão em democracia», resultados estes que foram replicados por Anderson e Tverdova (2003) ao utilizarem a «satisfação com a democracia» como variável dependente. Wagner, Schneider e Halla (2009) mostram que os indicadores da qualidade institucional, o Estado de direito e, de novo, o controlo da corrupção, a nível dos países, afectam as avaliações do desempenho do regime democrático. Por fim, Curini, Jou e Memoli (2010) mostram que as instituições que «promovem a qualidade da alocação de recursos e a prestação de serviços públicos», tal como medidos pelos índices compostos de governação do Banco Mundial (Kaufmannet al. 2010), estão associadas a\n\n243\n\nníveis mais elevados de satisfação popular com a forma como a democracia funciona em cada país.\n\nOutputs e apoio difuso: a hipótese «Easton-Lipset-Dahl»\n\nSerá isto também verdade para uma dimensão diferente das opiniões dos cidadãos sobre o regime, o seu apoio fundamental à democracia enquanto forma de governo? À primeira vista, existem motivos para acreditar que não deverá ser esse o caso. Afinal, o próprio Easton definiu o apoio difuso como sendo composto pelas «avaliações sobre o que um objecto é ou representa – o significado geral que tem para uma pessoa – e não sobre aquilo que faz» (Easton 1975, 444). «Representando a adesão aos objectos políticos em si mesmos, [o apoio difuso] não será facilmente abandonado por causa da insatisfação presente com o que o governo faz» (Easton 1975, 445). É claro que É claro que Easton nunca pretendeu sugerir que o apoio difuso e as normas e valores que estão na sua base não são afectados por processos de mudança. Easton chama a atenção para que, se fosse esse o caso, «nunca teríamos mudado desde a Idade da Pedra». Mas, deste ponto de vista, a mudança no apoio difuso ocorre lentamente. As suas fontes encontram-se na aprendizagem social, socialização, doutrinação e «politização» (Easton 1957, 395-400, 1965a, 125-127, e 1975, 445). Consequentemente, os «outputs e o desempenho benéfico podem aumentar e diminuir, enquanto este apoio, sob a forma de adesão generalizada, persiste» (Easton 1975, 444). Contudo, muitas das leituras posteriores de Easton têm negligenciado o facto de este autor ter sugerido que o apoio difuso também pode estar relacionado com o desempenho dos governos propriamente dito. Como o próprio afirma (Easton 1965a, 199-120), se as autoridades\n\nsão incapazes ou não estão dispostas a responder às exigências dos membros [...] em última instância poder-se-á esperar que esta situação dê origem a um estado de descontentamento elevado e sujeito a um aumento constante. Seguindo este rumo, se as exigências continuassem a ser barradas ou negadas, a desafeição dos membros relevantes pode também passar para o regime.\n\nEaston não foi o único a defender este argumento. Uma ideia semelhante foi apresentada por Lipset no seu artigo seminal de 1959, «Some social requisites of democracy». Aqui este autor distinguia entre legitimidade – «a capacidade de um sistema político de criar e manter a crença de que as instituições políticas existentes são as mais apropriadas ou próprias para a sociedade» – e eficácia – «o real desempenho de um sistema político, na\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\n244\n\nGovernação eficaz e apoio à democracia\n\nmedida em que satisfaz as funções básicas de governo, como definidas pela maioria dos membros de uma sociedade [...], marcada por uma burocracia e um sistema de tomada de decisões eficientes» (1959, 86). Segundo Lipset, a legitimidade também pode ser construída ou destruída com base na governação eficaz: «se um novo sistema é incapaz de manter as expectativas dos principais grupos (tendo por base a «eficácia») por um período suficientemente longo para desenvolver a legitimidade numa nova base, pode desenvolver-se uma nova crise» (1959, 87). «Mesmo em sistemas legítimos, uma quebra na eficácia, repetidamente ou por um período longo, pode pôr em perigo a sua estabilidade» (1959, 89). Por fim, estes argumentos também encontram eco em Dahl, no seu Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition (1971). Seguindo a tradição da «cultura política», Dahl assinala que os factores que conduzem «um país a um regime hegemónico ou à contestação pública e à poliarquia [...] têm de operar, de certo modo, através das crenças do povo» (1971, 124) e essas crenças devem ser vistas «como uma variável independente de importância [nas] [...] tentativas de dar conta das variações nos regimes» (1971, 188). No entanto, surgem duas questões. Que crenças são cruciais deste ponto de vista? E o que, por sua vez, poderia explicá-las? Entre essas crenças, Dahl discute as que dizem respeito à «eficácia» ou «eficiência de output» (1971, 148). Numa certa medida, estas crenças podem ser um «elemento mais ou menos fixo na cultura política de um país» (Dahl 1971, 144), «adquiridas através da socialização primária» (1971, 146). No entanto, Dahl também advertia que esta reserva de crenças podia ser esvaziada por governos ineficazes, com consequências profundas. Em casos históricos concretos, «a incapacidade de poliarquias recém-estabelecidas [...] em lidarem com problemas palpáveis [...] gerou dúvidas sobre a sua eficácia e motivou a viragem para a ditadura» (1971, 147). E, tal como Easton, Dahl pensava que estas crenças sobre as instituições políticas, governos e regimes eram moldadas pela «experiência»: as «discrepâncias substanciais entre as crenças e as experiências pessoais podem conduzir a uma mudança nas crenças» (1971, 178). Em suma, a hipótese geral «Easton-Lipset-Dahl» sugere que, independentemente dos processos de socialização que podem levar à adopção de valores congruentes com a democracia, o fracasso dos governos na produção de outputs e políticas públicas eficazes diminui o apoio difuso entre os cidadãos ao regime em que vivem. No entanto, os estudos empíricos a favor desta hipótese têm sido escassos e algo contraditórios. Muitos estudos, utilizando dados do World Values Survey (Klingemann 1999; Dalton 2004), o «Comparative National Elections Project» (Gunther et al. 2007), o «Afroba 245\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\n246\n\nrómetro» (Bratton et al. 2005), ou o «Latinobarómetro» (Lagos 2003), demonstraram que as avaliações do desempenho do regime, por um lado, e o apoio ao regime, por outro, apresentam tendências diferentes e têm correlatos e etiologias diferentes. O apoio difuso à democracia, em particular, parece não ter relação com o desempenho económico ou governativo. Já Gilley (2006a) mostra a existência de uma relação entre a «governação geral», por um lado, e a «legitimidade do Estado», por outro, usando dados de 72 países. Contudo, neste estudo, a operacionalização da variável dependente é problemática para os nossos objectivos. Para medir a «legitimidade do Estado», Gilley agrega diversos indicadores económicos, comportamentais e atitudinais, incluindo a confiança nas instituições do Estado, o uso da violência, a afluência às urnas e os impostos, bem como dados de inquérito sobre a «satisfação com o desenvolvimento democrático» e a «satisfação com o funcionamento da democracia» (v. também Gilley 2006b). O uso da «satisfação com a democracia», ou itens semelhantes, em particular, levanta vários problemas quando se pretende testar a hipótese «Easton-Lipset-Dahl», especialmente dado o argumento já testado repetidamente de que tais itens não parecem dar conta do apoio difuso à democracia e da rejeição de alternativas não democráticas (Canache et al. 2001; Linde e Ekman 2003; Gunther et al. 2007). Podemos abordar esta questão de uma outra forma? Sugiro que sim.\n\nPrincipais variáveis e hipóteses\n\nApoio difuso à democracia\n\nO apoio difuso à democracia tem sido medido de muitas formas diferentes em inquéritos de opinião. Neste capítulo mantenho-me próximo da abordagem utilizada por Inglehart e Welzel (2005; v. também Mattes e Bratton 2007), a qual combina respostas a perguntas sobre o apoio à democracia com respostas a perguntas sobre a rejeição da autocracia. Os dados aqui utilizados são provenientes dos projectos European Values Study (EVS) e World Values Survey (WVS), em particular dos inquéritos em que as perguntas seguintes foram colocadas. «Diga como avalia cada uma das seguintes formas de governo para o país. Para cada uma, diga se é uma forma de governo muito boa, boa, má, ou muito má»:\n\n1) «Ter um líder forte que não tenha de se preocupar nem com o parlamento nem com as eleições»; 2) «Serem as Forças Armadas a governar o país»;\n\nGovernação eficaz e apoio à democracia\n\n3) «Ter um sistema político democrático».1\n\nEstas questões foram incluídas na terceira (1999-2000) e quarta (2008) vagas do EVS e na terceira (1995-1998), quarta (1999-2000) e quinta (2005-2008) vagas do WVS.2 Consultei as ferramentas online de análises de dados do ZACAT para os estudos EVS e ferramentas semelhantes para os estudos WVS. Após primeiro recolher as bases de dados do EVS, recolhi então as bases de dados das três vagas do WVS, eliminando todas as sobreposições em países europeus, bem como todos os inquéritos em que as três perguntas não fossem colocadas. Foi recolhido um total de 219 inquéritos de 99 países, com o mínimo de um inquérito por país e um máximo de 5, todos realizados entre 1994 e 2009. As respostas a nível individual às três questões foram codificadas de 1 («muito boa») a 4 («muito má»). Inverti esta escala de 4 pontos para o item 3 («ter um sistema político democrático»), para que assim um valor mais alto represente um apoio mais forte à democracia, da mesma forma que valores mais altos para os dois outros itens representam uma rejeição mais forte de formas autocráticas de governo. Para cada inquérito calculei a média aritmética de cada um dos itens e, em seguida, calculei a média destes valores por inquérito, criando assim um índice de autocracia-democracia, que simplesmente faz a média por país dos valores dos três indicadores. Esta variável do índice de autocracia-democracia compreende valores que vão desde 1,97 (o Vietname no inquérito do WVS de 2001) até 3,7 (a Grécia nos inquéritos do WVS de 1999 e do EVS de 2008 e a Dinamarca no inquérito do EVS de 2008). Apenas dois inquéritos (o Vietname, 2001, e o Paquistão, 1997) colocam países na metade inferior da escala do índice de autocracia-democracia. A esmagadora maioria dos inquéritos tende claramente a detectar um apoio difuso à democracia generalizado e a variação na nossa amostra de casos é relativamente baixa. No entanto, a inclusão de itens de «rejeição da autocracia» parece de facto\n\n247\n\n1 Uma questão adicional nos inquéritos EVS/WVS perguntava aos inquiridos em relação à mesma avaliação sobre «serem os especialistas e não os governantes a tomar as decisões de acordo com o que consideram ser melhor para o país». Decidi não incluir este item, uma vez que o «governo por especialistas» não corresponde a nenhum tipo de regime específico que tenha feito parte da experiência dos inquiridos, directa ou indirectamente. A mesma decisão para excluir este item foi tomada por Inglehart, a partir de um trabalho anterior (2003), no estudo de 2005 com Welzel. 2 Disponível em http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/ e http://www.wvsevsdb.com/wvs/ WVSAnalize.jsp.\n\naumentar de algum modo essa variação e, em todo o caso, a variação limitada pode ser entendida como diminuindo a probabilidade de encontrarmos correlatos significativos do apoio à democracia.\n\nEficácia governativa\n\nEntre as muitas medidas de «governação» disponíveis na literatura, aplico aqui a que me parece estar mais próxima, conceptual e teoricamente, das noções de «eficácia», «eficiência de outputs» e «qualidade das políticas públicas e da sua implementação», que advêm da discussão teórica na secção anterior: o indicador de eficácia governativa do Banco Mundial. Um dos seis indicadores de world governance, a «eficácia governativa» capta «as percepções da qualidade dos serviços públicos, da qualidade do funcionalismo público e do grau da sua independência de pressões políticas, da qualidade da formulação e implementação de políticas e da credibilidade do empenho dos governos em relação a essas políticas» (Kaufmann et al. 2010, 4).3\n\nSão utilizadas quinze fontes de dados diferentes pelo WGI para construir os valores anuais de eficácia governativa. Nove resultam das avaliações de especialistas da qualidade burocrática, da prestação de serviços públicos, da estabilidade de políticas, da gestão do orçamento e da gestão dos recursos. Três resultam de inquéritos a empresas sobre os mesmos tópicos. Por fim, três resultam de inquéritos à população de avaliação à satisfação com os serviços públicos e, no caso de uma fonte (o «Latinobarómetro»), à confiança no governo (Banco Mundial 2011). A escala utilizada compreende valores entre –2,5 e 2,5, em que os valores mais altos significam maior eficácia governativa. Os dados estão disponíveis desde 1996, em intervalos de dois anos até 2002 e anualmente desde\n\nPedro C.

Fizemos a correspondência entre cada inquérito em cada país-ano e os respectivos valores de eficácia governativa. Para os anos de 1997, 1999 e 2001 utilizámos a média dos valores de eficácia governativa nos anos imediatamente precedentes e subsequentes.4\n\nO quadro 9.3 dá conta das estatísticas descritivas da variável «eficácia governativa» na nossa amostra. O valor mais baixo é de –1,77 (Iraque em 2006) e o mais elevado de 2,23 (Dinamarca em 2008). É evidente que, com uma média aritmética de 0,47, existe algum enviesamento da amostra em favor dos países em que a eficácia governativa está acima da média mundial. Contudo, cerca de 43% das observações são de países-anos em que os valores de eficácia são inferiores a zero.\n\nHipóteses\n\nA hipótese principal é a de que a eficácia governativa aumentará o apoio difuso ao regime. A nossa variável dependente mede o apoio difuso à democracia. Assim, a hipótese pode ser apresentada da seguinte forma:\n\nH1: Em regimes democráticos, níveis mais elevados de eficácia governativa causam um apoio difuso mais elevado à democracia. O que deveríamos esperar em regimes autocráticos? Pela mesma lógica, deveríamos esperar que uma maior eficácia governativa aumentasse o apoio ao tipo de regime sob o qual os cidadãos vivem. Contudo, as perguntas sobre este tema incluídas no WVS cobrem apenas duas situações «não democráticas» (governo pelas Forças Armadas e «líderes fortes»), muito longe de captarem a enorme diversidade de regimes autocráticos. Logo, a nossa segunda hipótese, mais condicional, é a de que, em regimes autocráticos, a eficácia governativa deve fazer diminuir o apoio difuso à democracia.\n\n249\n\n4 Para o inquérito realizado em 1994 e os 10 inquéritos realizados em 1995 utilizámos os valores de eficácia de 1996.\n\nQuadro 9.2 – Eficácia governativa: estatísticas descritivas (219 país-anos)\n\nMédia aritmética 0,47 Mínimo –1,77 Máximo 2,23 Desvio-padrão 0,99\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\n250\n\nH2: Em regimes não democráticos, níveis mais elevados de eficácia governativa causam um apoio difuso mais baixo à democracia. Se o efeito da eficácia governativa sobre o apoio difuso dos cidadãos à democracia é contingente de viverem ou não numa democracia, então é necessário incluir na análise uma variável respeitante ao tipo de regime. Neste trabalho recorremos à classificação de regimes da Freedom House (FH). A FH publica relatórios sobre a protecção dos direitos políticos e liberdades civis a nível mundial desde 1973. É atribuída a cada país e território uma avaliação numérica numa escala de 1 a 7 para cada dimensão (em que 1 indica o grau mais elevado de liberdade e 7 o nível mais baixo de liberdade). Os países e territórios são então classificados de três formas: livre, parcialmente livre e não livre, segundo a média dessas avaliações (1,0 a 2,5 são considerados livres, 3,0 a 5,0 parcialmente livres e 5,5 a 7,0 não livres).\n\nEficácia governativa como correlato do apoio à democracia\n\nJá fora sugerido por Easton, Lipset ou Dahl que o apoio difuso ao regime teria outras fontes, para além da eficácia governativa ou da qualidade dos outputs do sistema, e algumas das determinantes podem estar a funcionar como factores de confusão na estimação da relação entre o tipo de regime e a eficácia governativa, por um lado, e apoio à democracia, por outro. O quadro 9.3 aborda esta questão, fornecendo resultados de uma análise de regressão linear em que o tipo de regime, a eficácia e a sua interacção são acompanhados no modelo por um conjunto de variáveis de controlo. Incluímos, em primeiro lugar, o desenvolvimento económico, medido como PIB per capita em cada país-ano.5 É provável que os países mais ricos tenham desenvolvido uma eficácia governativa superior aos países mais pobres e esta relação entre boa governação e níveis mais elevados de rendimento seja extremamente forte e basicamente «indiscutível» (Rodrik 2008). Contudo, o desenvolvimento pode igualmente dotar os cidadãos de segurança económica, educação e oportunidades individuais que con 5 Mais especificamente, utilizámos para cada país-ano a PPP, convertendo o PIB per capita em milhares de dólares internacionais constantes de 2005.

Nas análises apresentadas ao longo deste capítulo utilizei o logaritmo natural deste valor.\n\nGovernação eficaz e apoio à democracia\n\n251\n\nduzem à sua socialização no sentido de uma menor deferência à autoridade e um maior apoio à democracia (Inglehart 1997; Diamond 1999). A experiência democrática indica o número de anos, à data do inquérito, de vigência do regime democrático de cada país, exprimindo a possibilidade de que em países em que essa experiência seja mais longa para os cidadãos a rejeição de soluções autocráticas possa ser mais forte. Uma vez que a Freedom House apenas codifica países desde 1973, utilizámos uma base de dados diferente (a base de dados DD democracy and dictator ship revisited: Cheibub et al. 2010)6 para contar, desde 1946 (no máximo) até ao ano do inquérito, o número de anos de codificação de um país como democracia.\n\n6 Disponível em https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/cheibub/www/DD_page.html.\n\nQuadro 9.3 –Eficácia e índice de autocracia-democracia em regimes livres, parcialmente livres e não livres\n\nOLS\n\nConstante 2,95 (0,10) ***\n\nPIB per capita 0,002 (0,003)\n\nDesigualdade na distribuição do rendimento –0,004 (0,002) *\n\nAnos DD democracy –0,00008 (0,001)\n\nFH livre (0,1) 0,21 (0,08) ***\n\nFH parcialmente livre (0,1) 0,19 (0,08) **\n\nEficácia –0,24 (0,08) ***\n\nEficácia * FH livre 0,43 (0,09) ***\n\nEficácia * FH parcialmente livre 0,17 (0,10) *\n\nPaís-anos 213 R2 0,45\n\n*p < 0,10; **p < 0,05; ***p < 0,01.

Magalhães\n\n252\n\nA desigualdade na distribuição do rendimento é medida pelo índice de Gini de desigualdade do rendimento disponível das famílias para cada país-ano a partir da world income inequality database.7 Solt (2012) concluiu que a desigualdade económica tende a aumentar as atitudes autoritárias, na sua medição por itens dos inquérito que procuram aferir as opiniões dos cidadãos em relação à «obediência» como algo que deve ser ensinado às crianças, o apoio à mudança social no sentido de um maior «respeito pela autoridade» e a predisposição individual para obedecer aos superiores no local de trabalho. Por fim, a nossa preocupação principal está relacionada com as hipóteses 1 e 2. Para testar as mesmas construí um modelo de regressão do índice de autocracia-democracia, integrando todas as variáveis de controlo anteriores, bem como duas variáveis dummy (livre e parcialmente livre), a variável eficácia e dois termos de interacção (livre*eficácia e parcialmente livre*eficácia). Na nossa amostra de 216 medições da nossa nova variável de tipo de regime, 135 são países livres, 60 parcialmente livres e 21 não livres. O quadro 9.3 apresenta os resultados utilizando o método dos mínimos quadrados (OLS). A desigualdade na distribuição de rendimento teve, como estava previsto, um efeito negativo no apoio à democracia/rejeição da autocracia. O mesmo não acontece quer com o desenvolvimento, quer com a idade da democracia. Contudo, os resultados principais estão aqui relacionados com o efeito contingente da eficácia sobre o apoio democrático. A figura 9.1 torna a interpretação dos dados mais fácil ao calcular os efeitos marginais da eficácia governativa sobre os três diferentes tipos de regime e os respectivos intervalos de confiança. Em regimes livres, um aumento de 2 pontos na eficácia governativa (cerca de dois desvios-padrão) aumenta significativamente o apoio à democracia em 0,38, mais do que um desvio-padrão na variável dependente (0,30). Para ilustrar, se a eficácia governativa numa democracia liberal como o Mali melhorasse de forma a assemelhar-se, digamos, à Austrália, prevê-se que o apoio à democracia aumentaria em .38, o que corresponde a mais de metade da diferença efectivamente observada entre os dois países no índice de apoio à autocracia-democracia. No contexto inverso, tanto em regimes parcialmente livres como não livres, a relação entre o governação eficaz e o apoio à democracia é negativa, sendo-o de forma significativa nos regimes não livres, ou seja, autocracias «puras». Nestes\n\n7 Solt (2008-2009), disponível em http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/fsolt/faces/ study/StudyPage.xhtml?studyId=36908.\n\nGovernação eficaz e apoio à democracia\n\ncasos, um aumento de dois desvios-padrão na eficácia do governo diminuiria o apoio à democracia em cerca de 0,48. Em suma, são obtidos resultados que corroboram tanto a hipótese 1 como a hipótese 2. O apoio difuso à democracia está fortemente relacionado com a eficácia da governação. As democracias liberais eficazes apresentam níveis de apoio mais elevados à democracia (e rejeição da autocracia) do que as ineficazes. Por oposição, os regimes «não livres» eficazes apresentam níveis de apoio mais baixos à democracia do que os ineficazes.\n\nEficácia governativa como causa do apoio à democracia\n\nPodem ser levantadas várias objecções em relação aos resultados obtidos até este ponto. Uma delas diz respeito à medição da eficácia governativa. O indicador WGI é construído a partir da avaliação de especialistas, de empresas e, no caso de uma das fontes, do público em geral. Para além do problema óbvio de utilizar respostas de inquéritos à população – mesmo que sobre assuntos diferentes (apoio à democracia vs. qualidade dos serviços públicos e confiança no governo) – para construir tanto a variável independente fundamental como as variáveis dependentes, é difícil não imaginar a possibilidade de condicionamento das avaliações da eficácia governativa por tais especialistas e stakeholders, de\n\n253\n\nFigura 9.1 – Efeitos marginais da eficácia governativa sobre o apoio á autocracia-democracia em regimes livres, parcialmente livres e não livres (intervalos de confiança de 90%)\n\n0,60\n\n0,40\n\n0,20\n\n0,00\n\n–0,20\n\n–0,40\n\n–0,60\n\nEfeito marginal da eficácia\n\nLivre Parcialmente livre Não livre\n\nacordo com as suas atitudes em relação ao regime e/ou as suas percepções das atitudes de massas. Acresce que há aqui uma clara possibilidade de existir uma efectiva causalidade inversa. De facto, um dos trabalhos mais proeminentes com base em comparações internacionais amplas utilizando dados do EVS e do WVS sustenta precisamente que a «democracia eficaz» deve ser vista como uma consequência das atitudes de massas que favorecem a imposição de exigências às elites e autoridades políticas no sentido de adoptarem instituições democráticas e de levarem a mudança institucional para além da democracia «formal» (Inglehart e Welzel 2005, 191-204; v. também Welzel e Inglehart 2008). Mais especificamente, Ingleheart e Welzel constroem um índice de «democracia eficaz», cuja escala é limitada por dois extremos: situações em que não existem direitos políticos e civis ou em que as médias dos valores do WGI referentes a «Estado de direito» e «controlo da corrupção» atingem o nível mais baixo, ou, no outro extremo, casos em que os direitos democráticos são plenos e em que é atingida a média máxima dos valores do WGI. Assim, Inglehart e Welzel consideram que o «índice de democracia eficaz», na sua medição de 2000-2002, pode ser explicado por dois factores (Inglehart e Welzel 2005, 255, quadro 11.3). Em primeiro lugar, e acima de tudo, pela prevalência numa sociedade de «valores de expressão individual», uma síndroma de «tolerância, confiança, enfâse no bem-estar subjectivo, activismo cívico e expressão individual que emerge nas sociedades pós-industriais com níveis elevados de segurança existencial e autonomia individual» (Inglehart e Welzel 2005, 52). E segundo, em menor medida (mas ainda assim significativa e relevante), pela sua variável de «preferência democracia-autocracia», construída precisamente sobre as mesmas variáveis que utilizámos para construir o nosso «índice autocracia-democracia». É certo que um resultado crucial que já obtivemos não é coberto por este argumento de causalidade inversa proposto por Inglehart e Welzel: o facto de que existem países – regimes «não livres» – em que a relação entre o apoio à democracia e a eficácia governativa é negativa. Contudo, não é difícil conceber um mecanismo causal alternativo através do qual as atitudes possam estar a influenciar a governação e não o contrário. Por exemplo, a falta de apoio à democracia num regime autocrático pode ser um elemento que fornece o tipo de consenso político e apoio às autoridades que permite que estas produzam políticas estáveis e coerentes e as implementem com eficácia, enquanto essa falta de apoio em democracia pode precisamente funcionar como um impedimento à boa governação. As análises realizadas até ao momento não\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\n254\n\nGovernação eficaz e apoio à democracia\n\npermitem refutar a possibilidade de que os resultados que obtivemos na secção anterior possam ter sido motivados por um mecanismo causal inverso desse tipo. Felizmente, existe uma tradição importante de investigação que aborda esta e outras fontes de enviesamento devido à endogeneidade na estimação da relação causal entre a governação e a qualidade institucional, por um lado, e os resultados sociais e económicos relevantes, por outro. A abordagem consiste em encontrar bons preditores de «boa governação» que se prove serem simultaneamente exógenos ao resultado de interesse e afectá-lo apenas através de «boa governação», utilizar esses instrumentos para isolar a variação exógena na variável endógena (governação) e explorar essa variação com o objectivo de obter uma estimativa sem enviesamento do efeito da governação no resultado de interesse. La Porta et al. (1999) mostram que é possível fazer uma boa previsão das variações no desempenho do governo através das suas origens legais. A common law, a civil law francesa, alemã e escandinava e o direito socialista foram desenvolvidos há séculos em países específicos, «mas depois espalharam-se por todo o mundo através de conquistas, colonização, imitação e adopção voluntária» (La Porta et al. 1999, 231). Estes autores demonstram que, em relação às medidas que nos interessam em especial, como, por exemplo, a eficiência do sector público (atrasos burocráticos e cumprimento das obrigações fiscais) e a qualidade da prestação de serviços públicos, os países que seguem o direito francês tendem a apresentar piores resultados do que os países que seguem a common law ou a civil law escandinava e alemã, um resultado que atribuem à ênfase dada aos direitos de propriedade na tradição britânica e à capacidade dos países de direito escandinavo e alemão de construírem burocracias profissionais. Num outro estudo, Chong e Zanforlin (2000) mostram que, por comparação com o direito inglês ou alemão/escandinavo, a civil law francesa tende a ter uma relação negativa com diversos indicadores de qualidade institucional. Num trabalho posterior, La Porta et al. (2008) demonstram que muitos dos resultados de 1999 ainda permanecem válidos, independentemente de os efeitos das origens legais serem estimados em regimes democráticos ou autocráticos, o que revela que as regras institucionais e legais que afectam a governação tendem a ser desenhadas de forma consistente com as tradições legais e independentemente das condições políticas (La Porta et al. 2008, 314-315). Com base nestas conclusões, diversos estudos têm utilizado, como instrumentos de «eficácia governativa» e outros indicadores WGI, variáveis de origens legais (Easterly e Levine 2003; Borrmann et al. 2006; Daude e Stein 2007).\n\n255\n\nSigo aqui uma estratégia semelhante. Começo por dividir os nossos países-anos em três subamostras (livres, parcialmente livres e não livres), fazendo estimações de variáveis instrumentais do efeito da eficácia governativa sobre o apoio à democracia em cada uma. Espera-se, como já vimos, que esse efeito seja positivo em países livres e negativo em países não livres, mas iremos agora determinar se esses efeitos sobrevivem quando controlamos a endogeneidade da eficácia governativa. É realizada uma estimação de variáveis instrumentais utilizando as variáveis de origens legais recolhidas por La Porta et al. (2008), as quais codificam os países exclusivamente no direito francês, britânico, alemão e escandinavo. Para obter os resultados das variáveis instrumentais utilizei o estimador LIML (limited information maximum likelihood): como apresentado por Staiger e Stock (1997), as estimativas LIML têm melhores propriedades para pequenas amostras do que outros estimadores e os intervalos de confiança podem ser razoavelmente precisos mesmo quando a estatística F, que mede a significância conjunta dos regressores na equação de primeira fase, está abaixo do valor indicativo de 10. Note-se que, em todas as estimações, a sobreidentificação das restrições nunca é rejeitada, ou seja, não podemos rejeitar a hipótese nula de que as variáveis instrumentais utilizadas são válidas. Segundo, a estatística F, que mede a significância das regressões da primeira fase, indica que são todas significativas em pelo menos 0,05. Contudo, encontram-se quase todas abaixo de 0,10, o que sugere a conveniência de confiar no LIML, em vez de nas estimações 2SLS. Os resultados mostram, em primeiro lugar, que não podemos rejeitar a hipótese de que a eficácia e o apoio à democracia não estão relacionados nos países parcialmente livres. Contudo, os efeitos da eficácia governativa sobre o apoio à democracia em países livres e não livres são significativos em todas as estimações e\n\nPedro C.

Os valores do X2(2) testam a sobreidentificação das restrições.\n\nGovernação eficaz e apoio à democracia\n\ntêm tamanhos semelhantes, apesar de estarem nas direcções opostas, como esperado. Ao compararmos estes coeficientes com os obtidos no quadro 9.2, concluímos que eles são sempre maiores: por outras palavras, a variação na eficácia governativa que é atribuível às origens legais parece estar mais fortemente relacionada com o apoio de massas à democracia do que com as próprias medidas de eficácia governativa. Isto pode dever-se a erros de medição na eficácia governativa, apesar de não podermos excluir completamente a possibilidade de os instrumentos não serem válidos. De qualquer modo, aumentámos, ainda assim, a nossa confiança, comparativamente aos resultados obtidos na secção anterior, na noção de que a eficácia governativa afecta o apoio de massas à democracia e realiza isso de forma diferente – em direcções opostas, como esperado – em democracias liberais e em regimes autocráticos.\n\nConclusão\n\nVários estudos têm mostrado que o apoio difuso ao regime, captado através de questões que medem as preferências dos cidadãos pela democracia por comparação com outros regimes, como as aqui utilizadas, parece ter uma correlação muito fraca com as percepções da população em relação ao desempenho do governo e da economia (Gunther et al. 2007; Chu et al. 2008). A conclusão que é daí muitas vezes retirada é que o apoio difuso à democracia não é afectado pelo desempenho do governo. Os resultados deste capítulo sugerem que, se desviarmos o foco da nossa atenção dos resultados para os outputs, adoptando uma visão mais ampla do que significa «desempenho do governo» – a qualidade das políticas públicas, da sua formulação e aplicação e a credibilidade dos compromissos dos governos com essas políticas –, a conclusão deverá ser outra. A crença dos cidadãos na superioridade da democracia em relação à autocracia é afectada pelo grau de eficácia da governação do regime em que vivem: em democracia a eficácia promove o apoio à democracia, em autocracia diminui esse apoio. Isto tem implicações importantes para a questão da estabilidade dos regimes. Após o entusiasmo trazido pela democratização no Sul da Europa, na América Latina, no Leste europeu e em partes da Ásia e da África, a literatura aponta claramente para o facto de diversas formas de governo autoritário parecerem ter um poder de permanência considerável (Levitsky e Way 2010). Têm sido avançados muitos factores como correlatos da estabilidade ou da instabilidade nas autocracias. Estes incluem\n\n257\n\nPedro C. Magalhães\n\n258\n\ndiferentes tipos de governação autocrática (Geddes 1999), a existência de eleições (Magaloni 2008), crescimento económico (Haggard e Kaufman 1995), ou desenvolvimento económico (Epstein et al. 2006). Contudo, na medida em que as autocracias também dependem do apoio de massas e do consentimento público para a sua sobrevivência tanto (ou talvez ainda mais) quanto as democracias (Magaloni e Wallace 2008), este capítulo chama a atenção para outro potencial factor promotor da estabilidade das autocracias: a governação eficaz. Estudos recentes revelam que a sobrevivência das autocracias aumenta com a adopção de instituições que promovem compromissos credíveis, formalizam interacções entre as elites governantes e os seus aliados e aumentam a transparência na formulação de políticas autoritárias (Gandhi e Przeworski 2007; Boix e Svolik 2011), enquanto outros têm mostrado que a adopção de tais disposições tem efeitos importantes sobre a boa governação (Gelbach e Keefer 2007). Este capítulo sugere que uma ligação importante entre a institucionalização nas autocracias e o aumento da estabilidade pode ser o facto de, em autocracias, a boa governação ser reconhecida pelos cidadãos e convertida em apoio Uma segunda implicação está relacionada com os regimes democráticos. No inquérito sobre a «qualidade da democracia» realizado em 2011, que serve de base a muitos dos capítulos deste volume, destacam-se claramente duas conclusões. Em primeiro lugar, apenas 56% dos inquiridos acreditam que «a democracia é preferível a qualquer outra forma de governo», um valor inferior ao encontrado usando as mesmas questões na maioria das democracias europeias. Em segundo lugar, quando inquiridos sobre diversas dimensões da eficácia da governação em Portugal, uma clara maioria destaca a percepção de problemas substanciais na implementação de políticas, de alterações constantes à legislação, de uma dificuldade em obter consenso político para reagir às crises económicas e de falta de competência técnica em decisões políticas. À luz das conclusões deste capítulo, a coexistência destas atitudes parece ser algo mais do que uma coincidência: na presença de governação ineficaz, o próprio apoio ao regime, e não apenas a satisfação com o desempenho do regime, pode ser prejudicado.\n\nGovernação eficaz e apoio à democracia\n\n259\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nAlmond, G.

Mas «democracia» é um conceito e uma realidade multidimensional. Dela esperamos que represente a diversidade de preferências das pessoas, que faça cumprir as leis e dê acesso à justiça, que responsabilize quem governa, que produza políticas eficazes e até, porventura, que promova bem-estar e igualdade de oportunidades. O que esperam os portugueses da democracia? E como a avaliam nestas múltiplas dimensões? É a estas perguntas que este livro dá resposta.\n\nwww.ics.ul.pt/imprensa\n\nApoio:\n\nAutores: Ana Maria Evans Carlos Jalali Edalina Rodrigues Sanches Ekaterina Gorbunova Filipa Raimundo Filipe Carreira da Silva Frederico Ferreira da Silva\n\nJosé Pedro Zúquete Marcelo Camerlo Marco Lisi Marina Costa Lobo Mónica Brito Vieira Nina Wiesehomeier Riccardo Marchi Susana Cabaço\n\nIlustração da capa: Nuno Fonseca"

As décadas de paz que a Europa tem vivido desde da Segunda Guerra Mundial caracterizam-se por uma expansão democrática e um desenvolvimento económico sem precedentes. Em simultâneo, os comportamentos dos cidadãos passaram por alterações comportamentais substanciais, revelando padrões novos de acção, intervenção e contestação política.\n\nPrimeiro, Inglehart e, depois, Dalton, estudaram este fenómeno e defendem uma nova corrente, um novo paradigma social, apelidado de pós-materialismo. A evolução da sociedade introduziu novos comportamentos e assistiu-se ao surgimento de novas formas dos cidadãos expressarem e defenderem os seus interesses. Denota-se que protestos são mais pacíficos, mas são também mais alternativos. Novas formas de protesto procuram constituir originais entraves ao funcionamento das instituições políticas e públicas. Os jovens europeus expressam uma mentalidade diferente das gerações anteriores. Cresceram num meio confortável e pacifico e demonstram outras expectativas perante a sociedade e a relação com os seus governantes. Entendem o Estado como fonte de imposições e restrições, as quais necessitam de ser questionadas. Demonstram uma relação de cepticismo em relação à elite política. A presente dissertação tenciona contribuir para compreender se Portugal se insere nesta realidade europeia. A análise procura avaliar a relação que a Assembleia da República Portuguesa estabelece com os seus cidadãos, e ao mesmo tempo a dissertação procura contribuir para a caracterização do eleitorado português em comparação com eleitorados de outros países europeus.\n\n6\n\nAgradecimentos\n\nGostaria de agradecer a todos o que, de uma forma ou de outra, me\n\najudaram e incentivaram a cumprir esta meta tão importante. Em primeiro\n\nlugar, obrigada à minha família e amigos que me deram muito apoio durante\n\ntodo o processo e nunca me deixaram perder o ânimo para continuar. Em\n\nsegundo, queria agradecer à minha orientadora, cujo primeiro livro que me\n\ndeu lançou-me nesta viagem que agora culmina. Mas este é só mais um\n\npasso e não o fim da viagem.\n\n7\n\n8\n\n“A política é demasiado importante para\n\nser deixada à mercê dos políticos.”\n\nT. S. Eliot\n\n9\n\nCapítulo 1. Introdução\n\nQual o nível de abertura e preparação das instituições políticas portuguesas, nomeadamente\n\nda Assembleia da República, à participação activa da sociedade civil face à aurora de uma nova\n\nexpressão social e valorativa que se regista nos países industrializados, o chamado «pós materialismo»? A ciência política depende da sua capacidade de compreender a realidade e\n\nprever o comportamento humano. Com o crescimento do número de democracias no mundo, a\n\nrealidade politica tem se alterado com rapidez e profundamente. Hoje, nos países considerados\n\nindustrializados (ou pós-industrializados), ocorrem mudanças na configuração social e laboral,\n\nque se reflectem nas condições e estilos de vida. Novos valores, novas clivagens sociais e novas\n\nformas de organização denunciam sociedades em mudança. As gerações europeias\n\nprivilegiavam , maioritariamente, em valores materiais, procurando apenas uma vida confortável\n\npara si e para os seus. No entanto, o desenvolvimento económico e social europeu das décadas\n\npós-guerra permitiram que os cidadãos europeus assumissem a sua sobrevivência como\n\ngarantida, sustentados por um período extenso de paz e isento de ameaças. Os cidadãos puderam\n\nassim ’ usufruir’ da abundância, da educação e dum estado social. Os cidadãos comuns\n\npassaram viver num mundo globalizado. Esta nova realidade desenvolveu novas formas de\n\npensar e refletiu-se em como o cidadão comum passou a entender o seu quotidiano. Abrindo\n\ncaminho para uma nova série de valores designados pós-materiais. Cada vez mais, os cidadãos\n\neuropeus evidenciam preocupação com a qualidade de vida e a preservação ambiental,\n\npreferindo mesmo sacrificar algum crescimento económico em prol destes valores. Regista-se\n\numa menor deferência à autoridade, menos dependência das normas sociais (bem como a sua\n\nrenovação), crescente individualismo e liberdade. No campo político, estas alterações também se\n\nobservam.. As formas tradicionais de participação na política perdem relevância para outras, mais\n\nalternativas. Os níveis de turnout cronicamente mais baixos e ligações a partidos menos fortes\n\n10\n\ndão lugar a um crescente recurso a reivindicação por meio de movimentos sociais, petições,\n\nboicotes, ocupações e manifestações pacíficas, ou até ataques informáticos. As velhas instituições\n\npolíticas e os velhos moldes não parecem adequar-se mais a estas novas configurações.\n\nAssociando a esta divisão entre valores materiais e pós-materiais, Dalton (2008) distingue entre\n\nVelha Política e Nova Política, como que descrevendo duas formas distintas de fazer política.\n\nConclui que “os pós-materialistas favorecem a expansão do processo democrático e o\n\nenvolvimento mais directo dos cidadãos no processo político.”1 (Dalton, 2008, pág. 94). Com\n\nefeito, as democracias destes países enfrentam novos desafios e procuram adaptar-se.\n\nFace a tais transformações, é oportuno querstionar - , Onde se insere o Portugal neste\n\ncontexto? Existem pós-materialistas em Portugal? E que preparação terão as instituições políticas\n\nportuguesas quando confrontadas com estas mudanças? Que abertura terão ao público?\n\nPretende-se contribuir para a perceção se a Assembleia da Repúblicase adaptou a à\n\nsociedade civil, face a estes novos desenvolvimentos no comportamento dos cidadaos. Escolheu se esta instituição, pois tem um papel central na política nacional e está na génese da relação do\n\npúblico com as elites políticas. Estarão os deputados portugueses próximos do seu eleitorado?\n\nPoderá a Assembleia da República abrir-se mais à sociedade civil e incentivar mais participação?\n\nAo mesmo tempo, procura-se analisar a sociedade portuguesa num enquadramento europeu, e\n\ntentar determinar se mostra sinais de uma saudável consolidação democrática e do despontar pós industrial e, se sim, em que grau. Portugal é, frequentemente, colocado no mesmo patamar que a\n\nmaioria dos países europeus (dentro da União Europeia), no entanto ainda regista níveis\n\ncomparativamente baixos de educação e de desempenho económico, não esquecendo o\n\nrelativamente curto período de democracia em plenas funções. É por isso pertinente analisar se\n\n1\n\nTradução livre de “post-materialists favor expanding the democratic process and more directly involving citizens in the political process.”.\n\n11\n\nos portugueses confiam nas suas instituições? Que imagem têm da sua classe política? Que\n\npensam da sua democracia? A tese através de uma analise quantitativa recorrendo procura\n\nanalisar as possíveis respostas para estas perguntas.\n\nO primeiro capítulo será dedicado à revisão da literatura. Nele, revisita-se o que se o\n\nconceito do pós-materialismo combinado com a analise da discussão sobre a relação entre\n\ncidadãos e Parlamentos. Procede-se a uma breve descrição do percurso da Assembleia da\n\nRepública desde a revisão constitucional de 1982. O pós-materialismo baseia-se em novos\n\ncomportamentos e novas formas de participação política (mais intensa), o que tem repercussões\n\nnas relações entre os eleitores e os seus parlamentos. A conjugação desses conceitos no contexto\n\nportuguês completará a análise.\n\nO capítulo II contém uma análise comparativa, baseada em dados empíricos, dividida em\n\ntrês eixos de interesse :o apoio à democracia, a confiança nas instituições políticas e os valores e\n\ncomportamentos sociais.. Os países escolhidos para comparação são o Reino Unido, Alemanha e\n\nEspanha. Grande parte dos dados será proveniente do European Values Study. Este estudo aplica\n\num questionário destinado a saber mais sobre, entre outros aspectos, o apoio à democracia, a\n\nconfiança nas instituições políticas e os valores e comportamentos sociais. A primeira vaga de\n\ninformação foi recolhida em 1981 e o questionário tem sido reaplicado a cada 9 anos. Já foi\n\naplicado em quase meia centena de países (apesar de não todos consistentemente em todas as\n\nvagas), cobrindo uma admirável proporção da população europeia (até agora foram realizadas\n\ncerca de 70 000 entrevistas). As vagas disponíveis a utilizar para a selecção de países em causa\n\nserão as de 1989-1993 e 1999-2004. Outra fonte importante será o Eurobarómetro, com dados dos\n\nrelatórios publicados entre 2004 e 2013. Será ainda utilizado um estudo feito aos deputados e aos\n\neleitores pelo CESOP, com dados entre 2008 e 2013, que permitem comparar as respostas dos\n\ndois grupos. Outros indicadores económicos, políticos e sociais complementares2 serão retirados\n\n2\n\n12\n\ndas bases de dados do Banco Mundial, do Eurostat e do Transparency International,\n\ncompreendendo o período entre 1999 e 2013. O primeiro eixo de análise é dedicado a procurar\n\nvestígios pós-materialistas entre os eleitores portugueses. Uma série de perguntas conjugadas\n\npermitirá traçar um perfil do cidadão português e ver até que ponto é que se encaixa no\n\nenquadramento pós-materialista. Em segundo lugar, afere-se o nível de confiança na Assembleia\n\ne interesse na política por parte dos cidadãos portugueses, para determinar o nível de proximidade\n\ndos últimos com a sua instituição parlamentar. Em terceiro lugar, contrapõem-se estas noções\n\ncom a opinião dos deputados, de modo a perceber em que pontos se tocam e descobrir,\n\nporventura, áreas em que a relação se pode tornar mais próxima ou pode encaixar uma maior\n\nparticipação cívica.\n\nO capítulo III discute-se aas observações empíricas à luz dos conceitos teóricos. e\n\nDiscute-se a relação cidadão-Parlamento em Portugal. em conclusão o estudo discute algumas\n\nsugestões que poderão eventualmente melhorar a congruência entre os parlamentares e as os\n\ncidadãos, esperando, com isso, contribuir para uma maior qualidade da democracia portuguesa.\n\nEsses indicadores ajudam a dar conta do contexto português e comparam com os outros países, para dar uma imagem das circunstâncias económicas políticas e sociais em que cada democracia funciona.\n\n13\n\nI. Metodologia\n\nNuma tentativa de perceber melhor as atitudes e percepções dos portugueses face à sua\n\nAssembleia da República e aos seus deputados, tentar-se-á inseri-las num contexto de\n\ncomparação com três outros países. A análise comparativa será maioritariamente quantitativa.\n\nTodavia, sempre que houver lacunas em termos de dados deste tipo, poderão ser preenchidas com\n\navaliações qualitativas, através de outros recursos, que possam ajudar a completar o quadro. As\n\nprincipais fontes serão o European Values Study e o Eurobarómetro. Alguma informação\n\ncomplementar será retirada das bases de dados do Eurostat, do Banco Mundial, da organização\n\nTransparency International e de agências especializadas das Nações Unidas, onde se poderá\n\ngarantir uma informação mais fidedigna. Tirar-se-á partido de um estudo realizado pelo Centro de\n\nInvestigação e Estudos de Sociologia, do Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (CIES-IUL), e outro,\n\ndo Centro de Estudos e Sondagens de Opinião da Universidade Católica (CESOP), que partilham\n\na temática discutida. Ambos serão úteis, pois recolhem informação entre cidadãos e junto dos\n\nmembros do parlamento, em separado, permitindo estabelecer comparações directas entre os dois\n\ngrupos.\n\nAs comparações serão estabelecidas entre Portugal, Espanha, Alemanha e Reino Unido.\n\nEspanha foi escolhida por ser um país que reúne condições semelhantes a Portugal, isto é, teve a\n\nsua democratização quase na mesma altura e é um país do Sul da Europa, com uma cultura\n\nsimilar e alguns valores/crenças comuns aos portugueses. A Alemanha e o Reino Unido aparecem\n\ncomo contrabalanço ao par Portugal-Espanha, uma vez que são países com condições muito\n\ndiferentes, do Norte da Europa e de uma cultura mais distinta. O Reino Unido tem a democracia\n\nmais antiga do mundo ainda em funções e a sua vida política assenta muito na tradição. A\n\nAlemanha, por outro lado, é uma democracia mais recente, mas não menos funcional. Esta\n\n14\n\nselecção de países pode ajudar a estabelecer comparações relevantes e encontrar tendências\n\ninteressantes, quanto ao comportamento da população face à política dos seus países.\n\nEm primeiro lugar, escolheu-se o European Values Study, pois vem sendo feito há algum\n\ntempo e é abrangente em termos de assuntos que toca e dos países que participam3. É um estudo\n\nque se dedica a investigar os valores sociais e morais que sustentam a cultura política das\n\npopulações nestes países. Havia a possibilidade de se utilizar o World Values Survey (WVS)4, que\n\né até geograficamente mais abrangente e faz perguntas do mesmo género, mas a disponibilidade\n\ndas respostas não é tão certa e os países escolhidos para estabelecer comparação falham muitas\n\ndas vagas completas até agora (especialmente Portugal), pelo que se provou mais seguro optar\n\npelo EVS. Foram recolhidas 4 vagas de dados. Começou em 1981, a segunda vaga realizou-se em\n\n1990, a terceira em 1999 e a última em 2008, perfazendo perto de 30 anos de dados. O EVS tem\n\nvárias perguntas que nos podem dar algumas imagens de comportamentos designados pós materialistas nas populações, tais como interesse e/ou conhecimento da vida política do seu país e\n\natitudes face à democracia e à protecção do ambiente ou a importância atribuída às liberdades\n\nindividuais. Será possível traçar um cenário abrangente do quotidiano, percepções e preferências\n\ndestes cidadãos. Os países escolhidos participam os quatro na mesma vaga só de 1990 em diante.\n\nSerá, pois, onde começará a análise. O horizonte temporal da tese é desde a consolidação\n\ndemocrática portuguesa, marcada no ano de 1982, mas cujo processo não se cinge a único\n\nmomento, pelo que começar a analisar desde 1990 também poderá proporcionar uma corrente de\n\n3\n\nEste estudo começou a ser realizado em 1981. Inicialmente, nem todos os países europeus participaram (apenas 10), mas outros foram se juntando progressivamente. Em 2008, a vaga mais recente a ser publicada, o EVS beneficiou da participação de 47 países.\n\n4\n\nO WVS foi realizado em 100 países (apesar de não participarem todos em todas as vagas) e engloba mais de 90% da população mundial. Houve seis vagas de 1981-84, 1989-93, 1994-99, 1999-2004, 2005-08 e a última a ser publicada ainda em 2014.\n\n15\n\ninformação num horizonte temporal relativamente alargado. O Reino Unido aparece como Grã Bretanha nas três vagas do EVS que se vão utilizar.\n\nEm segundo lugar, o Eurobarómetro, tal como o EVS, também contém informação\n\npreciosa sobre os comportamentos e percepções do eleitorado. Como funciona a nível europeu,\n\ntem dados de todos os Estados-membros da UE, onde se incluem os países da lista em mão. Além\n\ndisso, tem recolhido dados com uma periodicidade estável. Escolhe-se esta base de dados, pois,\n\nalém disto, tem perguntas específicas que dão uma noção da imagem que os eleitorados possuem\n\nde cada uma das suas classes políticas. Isto poderá dar uma noção do grau de\n\nproximidade/afastamento entre os membros do parlamento (mais do que relativamente aos\n\ngovernantes, pois a tese centra-se no desempenho da Assembleia da República) e o eleitorado.\n\nEm terceiro lugar, como já foi mencionado, recorrer-se-á a dados de um estudo\n\npromovido pelo CESOP junto dos membros do Parlamento que tem sido efectuado desde 2008 e\n\nque contém informação muito útil referente às posições dos deputados face ao eleitorado e face às\n\nsuas atitudes no desempenho das suas funções. A recolha de dados mais recentes teve lugar em\n\nFevereiro/Março de 2013, da qual tomou parte a autora desta dissertação. Além disso, o CESOP\n\nfez o obséquio de incluir uma pergunta específica neste último questionário destinada a criar\n\ninformação primária propositadamente para esta tese (ver questionário em anexo). Para efeitos de\n\nescolha de uma só pergunta que fosse concisa e ao mesmo tempo, desse uma boa parte de\n\ninformação relevante, pesquisou-se o trabalho de Alcántara Sáez, um professor de ciência política\n\nna Universidade de Salamanca, que se tem dedicado à investigação focada no lado da opinião da\n\nclasse política e, em específico, dos deputados na Assembleia.\n\nComo tal, foi escolhida a seguinte pergunta:\n\n16\n\n“Pensando no trabalho que desempenha como deputado, qual o grau de importância que atribui\n\na cada um dos seguintes aspectos? Utilize uma escala onde 1 significa “Nenhuma importância”,\n\n2 “Pouca importância”, 3 “Bastante importância” e 4 “Muita importância”.\n\na. Representar a nação\n\nb. Elaborar leis\n\nc. Resolver os problemas do país\n\nd. Controlar a actuação do governo\n\ne. Defender os interesses do seu partido\n\nf. Elaborar orçamentos\n\ng. Representar os interesses do seu distrito eleitoral.”\n\nO objectivo é demonstrar como conhecer a opinião pública pode contribuir para a classe\n\npolítica adaptar-se às necessidades da sua população, como a informar e educar o eleitorado,\n\ntornando-o mais activo na participação cívica.\n\n17\n\nCapítulo 2. Enquadramento teórico\n\nA revisão de literatura estabelece o enquadramento teórico que sustenta esta dissertação,\n\nestando organizada em duas partes principais. A primeira parte faz referência à teoria e\n\ninformação disponível sobre o pós-materialismo e a transformação social em marcha nas\n\nsociedades pós-industriais. A segunda parte debruça-se sobre a relação entre o Parlamento e os\n\ncidadãos. É analisada a sua evolução nas últimas décadas, e os esforços empreendidos para uma\n\nmaior aproximação ao seu público. Esta parte contempla ainda os contextos dos países\n\nselecionados para estabelecer uma análise comparativa. Inclui a transição e consolidação da\n\ndemocracia portuguesa, bem como a forma como a Assembleia da República está organizada, em\n\nque medida isso influencia o seu funcionamento e a relação com os eleitores portugueses.\n\nO pós-materialismo representa um advento de participação política. Os cidadãos referidos\n\ncomo pós-materialistas revelam mais cepticismo em relação às suas instituições e,\n\nparadoxalmente, denotam uma necessidade de se exprimirem de forma mais direta, assim como\n\num desejo de se envolverem mais no processo de decisão. Os pós-materialistas não querem deixar\n\nao acaso as decisões que influenciam a sua vida, sendo menos subservientes, mais reivindicativos\n\ne querendo ser ouvidos pelas autoridades nas causas pelas quais lutam. A teoria sobre relações\n\nentre cidadãos e Parlamento tem recolhido mais interesse recentemente (o que não será uma\n\ncoincidência). Em vários países, em particular nas democracias ocidentais e industrializadas, a\n\nimportância da opinião pública tem obtido um lugar mais central na cena política. As novas\n\ntecnologias possibilitam uma maior abertura, menos tempo de espera e uma relação mais próxima\n\ndos parlamentares e do seu trabalho. Mais do que nunca, os Parlamentos abrem-se ao público e\n\nprocuram estabelecer laços de confiança com os eleitores.\n\nA evolução da democracia portuguesa foi tardia e repleta de momentos de incerteza.\n\nQuando outras democracias ocidentais já estavam amadurecidas, a portuguesa aprendia a\n\n18\n\ngatinhar, vacilante. Em pouco menos de quatro décadas, a democracia portuguesa floresceu e\n\nconsolidou-se. Desde então, a Constituição portuguesa foi revista várias vezes (7 finalizadas e a\n\n8ª em preparação), o regimento da Assembleia da República sofreu inúmeras reformas e Portugal\n\ntornou-se membro da União Europeia. Neste contexto, as instituições procuraram encontrar a sua\n\nidentidade dentro do sistema político português. No caso particular da Assembleia da República,\n\nesta foi uma instituição que se debateu por encontrar uma voz, que passou de um órgão\n\nmeramente legislativo para ser encarado como forma de legitimação da democracia perante os\n\neleitores. A Assembleia da República não se tem furtado a este desafio, todavia as exigências\n\nsobre ela são crescentes.\n\nLarry Diamond, no seu artigo Toward Consolidation analisa o papel da sociedade civil no\n\nprocesso de consolidação democrática, clarificando a sua importância no seio de uma democracia\n\ne as suas funções na cena política. Mais importante ainda, sistematiza a utilidade da sociedade\n\ncivil em termos de democracy-building. Diamond descreve a sociedade civil como sendo o\n\n“reino da vida social organizada que é voluntário, gerado e (amplamente) sustentado por si\n\npróprio, autónomo em relação ao Estado, e que cumpre uma dada ordem de leis partilhadas.\n\nDistingue-se da «sociedade» em geral, no sentido em que os cidadãos agem colectivamente\n\nnuma esfera pública para exprimir os seus interesses, paixões, e ideias, trocar informação,\n\natingir objectivos mútuos, fazer exigências ao Estado e responsabilizar os políticos. A sociedade\n\ncivil é uma entidade intermedária, entre a esfera privada e o Estado. (…) Os agentes na\n\nsociedade civil precisam de protecção de uma ordem legal institucionalizada para proteger a\n\nsua autonomia e liberdade de acção. Assim, a sociedade civil, não só restringe o poder do\n\nEstado, mas legitima a sua autoridade quando ela é baseada no estado de direito.”5 (Diamond,\n\n5\n\nTradução livre de “(...) realm of organized social life that is voluntary, self-generating, (largely) self-supporting, autonomous from the state, and bound by a legal order or set of shared rules. It is distinct from «society» in general in that it involves citizens acting collectively in a public sphere to express their interests, passions, and ideas, exchange information, achieve mutual goals, make demands on the state, and hold state officials accountable. Civil society is an intermediary entity, standing between the private sphere and the state. (...) Actors in civil society need the protection of an institutionalized legal order to guard their autonomy and freedom of\n\n19\n\n1995, pág. 228). A sociedade civil é, portanto, uma camada intermédia entre diversos grupos de\n\numa sociedade que atua como um dos vértices do sistema democrático e pode servir para\n\nequilibrar o jogo político. No entanto, a sociedade civil em Portugal é historicamente muda e\n\npassiva, salvo raras exceções. Por sua vez a consolidação democrática é descrita como um\n\n“processo pelo qual a democracia se torna tão ampla e profundamente aceite entre os seus\n\ncidadãos que se torna muito improvável que caia. Envolve mudanças comportamentais e\n\ninstitucionais que normalizam a política democrática e reduzem a incerteza. (…) Expansão do\n\nacesso dos cidadãos, desenvolvimento da cidadania e cultura democráticas, alargamento do\n\nrecrutamento e treino de liderança, e outras funções que a sociedade civil desempenha. Mas,\n\nacima de tudo, e mais urgente que tudo, requer institucionalização política.”6 (Diamond, 1995,\n\npág. 238). Assim, Diamond realça a importância da qualidade das instituições para o bom\n\nfuncionamento da democracia. É considerado que a consolidação democrática em Portugal foi\n\nconcluída em 1982, aquando da revisão constitucional que acabou com o Conselho da Revolução.\n\nNão obstante, a democratização é um processo dinâmico e contínuo, sendo que a adesão à União\n\nEuropeia em 1986 (Comunidade Económica Europeia na altura) constituiu outro grande passo no\n\naprofundamento da democracia portuguesa. Por isso, o limite inferior da janela temporal de\n\nanálise realizada nesta dissertação será desde 1982, estendendo-se até ao presente. Portugal\n\nencontra-se, desde então, no que Cristina Leston-Bandeira denomina de “amadurecimento” da\n\ndemocracia, um estado pós-consolidação, mas ainda de criação de hábitos e tradições\n\ndemocráticas, e de progressiva melhoria da eficiência das instituições (mantendo em mente que o\n\nideal da democracia pressupõe um regime em constante evolução).\n\naction. Thus civil society not only restricts state power but legitimates state authority when that authority is based on the rule of law.” 6\n\nTradução livre de “process by which democracy becomes so broadly and profoundly legitimate among its citizens that it is very unlikely to break down. It involves behavioral and institutional changes that normalize democratic politics and narrow uncertainty. (...) expansion of citizen access, development of democratic citizenship and culture, broadening of leadership recruitment and training, and other functions that civil society performs. But most of all, and most urgently, it requires political institutionalization.”\n\n20\n\nCapítulo 2.1. O Pós-materialismo: impacto nas relações cidadãos instituições – O que está a acontecer com os cidadãos?\n\nOs cidadãos das sociedades pós-industrializadas denotam comportamentos que parecem\n\napontar para uma ruptura com as gerações anteriores. No entanto, será adequado relacionar estes\n\ncomportamentos com uma postura fundamentalmente diferente, que introduz uma mudança nos\n\nvalores sociais e morais destas sociedades? Poderá este novo paradigma ser associado a uma\n\nsociedade pós-materialista?\n\nAs teorias pós-materialistas assentam num conjunto abrangente de literatura, que foi\n\ninicialmente explorada por Inglehart e posteriormente desenvolvida por outros importantes\n\nautores, sendo de destacar o caso de Dalton no âmbito desta dissertação. A investigação de\n\nDalton sobre esta matéria envolve uma extensa revisão da teoria, e é baseada em séries temporais\n\nlongas e transversais a vários países, que cobrem períodos relativamente recentes. A ideia do fim\n\nda História avançada por Hegel no século XIX e recuperada por Francis Fukuyama, em 1992,\n\ndefende que todos os regimes do mundo caminham para um sistema democrático e que, chegado\n\nesse ponto, vigorará a paz e a História deixará de se desenrolar, pois não haverá mais conflitos\n\nentre países. Apesar do aumento relativo das democracias no mundo ser uma realidade, é\n\ninverosímil que o conflito e a História acabem. Dalton rejeita esta ideia, concentrando-se no\n\nestudo da evolução das democracias no mundo, que estão em desenvolvimento constante. Neste\n\nprocesso, o conflito não só é desejado, como é considerado essencial ao progresso, no sentido em\n\nque significa debate de ideias e opiniões. O estudo de Dalton trata do processo de democratização\n\nna perspectiva dos cidadãos, inserido no âmbito da recente disciplina de Citizen Politics (Política\n\nda Cidadania). Seguindo a linha de Inglehart para investigação das alterações sociais e\n\naxiológicas das sociedades em países industrializados, Dalton analisa as novas formas de\n\nexpressão da sociedade civil e de comunicação entre esta e a elite política.\n\n21\n\nA democratização e o envolvimento dos cidadãos na esfera política são processos\n\ncontínuos e em transformação. Dentro da classe académica, há quem alegue que este\n\nenvolvimento tem vindo a diminuir, enquanto outros falam de um crescente cepticismo face à\n\nclasse política, aos partidos e às instituições públicas. O que, na verdade, se testemunha é uma\n\nmudança na configuração social e laboral que tem reflexos nas condições e estilos de vida. No\n\nentanto, a motivação que lhe é subjacente pode ser mais complexa do que o mero desinteresse.\n\nDalton tenta explicar este fenómeno com base no princípio da alteração fundamental nas\n\ncaracterísticas socioeconómicas dos países pós-industriais que conduz a alterações do\n\ncomportamento das massas sociais. Estas alterações revestem-se de quatro principais faces\n\ndistintas: (i) a alteração no envolvimento do público na política; (ii) a alteração dos valores e\n\natitudes do público; (iii) a mudança na política partidária; e (iv) um aumento da eficácia das\n\ninstituições políticas que, por sua vez, tornou o público mais crítico do seu desempenho.\n\nNas décadas que se seguiram à II Guerra Mundial, as populações das democracias\n\nocidentais começaram a dar sinais de menos participação política acompanhada de um\n\ndesencantamento generalizado para com as suas instituições políticas. Russell Dalton, no seu\n\nlivro Citizen Politics: Public opinion and political parties in advanced industrial democracies\n\n(2008), analisa a fundo a participação da sociedade civil na política em cinco esferas diferentes: o\n\nvoto, a participação em campanha, a participação em associações cívicas, o contacto direto com\n\nrepresentantes em assuntos individuais e, finalmente, o protesto. Segundo os dados7 utilizados, os\n\ncidadãos, apesar de manterem o voto como principal modo de participação, procuram formas\n\nalternativas de se envolverem politicamente, especialmente através da criação/participação em\n\nassociações cívicas. O protesto ou manifestação como modo de participação política vem\n\nganhando popularidade nas sociedades pós-industrializadas. Neste contexto, o status-quo político\n\n7\n\nDalton faz uma análise a um grupo de quatro países: a França, a Alemanha, o Reino Unido e os EUA.\n\n22\n\ntem sido bastante desafiado, sendo que os cidadãos premeiam modos cada vez mais criativos, mas\n\ntambém mais pacíficos, de demonstrar insatisfação.\n\nSer um cidadão ativo envolve um nível básico de responsabilidade que implica adquirir um\n\ncerto nível de conhecimento, compreensão e interesse na vida política. Existe uma grande\n\ncontrovérsia quanto às reais capacidades das massas para se envolverem e perceberem o processo\n\npolítico. Das teorias de cidadania mais conhecidas, destaca-se o Modelo do Supercidadão,\n\ndefendido por Stuart Mill, Locke e Tocqueville, segundo o qual a democracia funcionaria\n\nverdadeiramente apenas com um eleitorado educado, informado e sofisticado. No entanto, as\n\nprimeiras estatísticas americanas de opinião pública dos anos 50/60 revelaram um público muito\n\ndiferente desta concepção inicial - com falta de estrutura ideológica e falta de consistência entre\n\nas crenças individuais e a posição assumida em determinados temas, bem como nas suas posições\n\npolíticas ao longo do tempo8. Neste seguimento, veio a Teoria Elitista da Democracia9, que\n\ncombina democracias em funcionamento com eleitores pouco sofisticados, apontando para uma\n\nheterogeneidade entre o eleitorado relativamente ao seu interesse na política. Isto significa que\n\nnuma sociedade há uma massa de eleitores que, apesar de poderem participar na política, não\n\ndemonstram muito interesse em fazer parte integrante dela, nem procurando estar informados.\n\nEsta teoria apresenta a ideia de que participação excessiva também pode conduzir ao colapso do\n\nregime democrático. O cidadão ideal não é aquele que é ativo, mas sim o potencialmente ativo10.\n\nNum certo nível, a participação (de toda ou da maioria da sociedade civil) tornar-se-ia impossível\n\nde gerir. Porém, Dalton afirma que esta é uma teoria incompleta que, apesar de ter por base dados\n\nempíricos, faz uma análise pouco profunda deste tema. Em contrapartida, avança com o que\n\napelida de Processo de Mobilização Cognitiva, argumentando que a sociedade americana mudou\n\n8\n\nCf. Electoral myth and reality: the 1964 election (1964), por Philip Ernest Converse; Aage R. Clausen e Warren E Miller.\n\n9\n\n23\n\nmuito desde a década de 50, segundo uma perspectiva de redução dos custos de se informar sobre\n\npolítica e o de aumento da capacidade em compreender a política. Isto tudo sob a premissa de que\n\nquanto mais educada uma população é, mais interesse manifesta na política. O desenvolvimento\n\nda comunicação social foi determinante, em especial da televisão. Se considerarmos que esta\n\nteoria foi delineada nos anos 80 e a isto juntarmos o recente desenvolvimento das novas\n\ntecnologias e das redes sociais, o potencial para uma participação política intensa aumentou\n\nexponencialmente.\n\nQuadro 1: Tipos de contacto entre cidadãos e a classe política\n\nTipo de\n\nparticipação\n\nTipo de influência Alcance Conflito Iniciativa\n\nnecessária\n\nCooperação\n\ncom outros\n\nVoto Pressão alta/pouca\n\ninformação\n\nColectivo Sim Pouca Pouca\n\nParticipação em\n\ncampanha\n\nPressão alta/pouca\n\na muita informação\n\nColectivo Sim Alguma Alguma a\n\nmuita Participação em\n\nassociações cívicas\n\nBaixa a alta\n\npressão/ muita\n\ninformação\n\nColectivo Sim/Não Alguma a\n\nmuita\n\nAlguma a\n\nmuita\n\nContacto direto c/\n\nrepresentantes em\n\nassuntos pessoais\n\nPressão baixa/\n\nmuita informação\n\nParticular Não Muita Pouca\n\nProtesto Pressão alta/muita\n\ninformação\n\nColectivo Muito Alguma a\n\nmuita\n\nAlguma ou\n\nmuita Fonte: Citizen Politics: Public opinion and political parties in advanced industrial democracies (2008)\n\nDalton destaca cinco diferentes formas de participação política dos cidadãos e classifica as relativamente a cinco dimensões relevantes na transformação social. Em democracia, o voto é\n\no instrumento de participação política por excelência, permitindo periodicamente aos eleitores\n\nPara saber mais sobre o protesto dentro da teoria elitista da democracia, ler Huntington (1981), Crozier, Huntington e Watanuki (1975).\n\n10\n\nPara aprofundar o conhecimento nesta teoria, consultar The civic culture: political attitudes and democracy in five nations (1963), da autoria de Gabriel A. Almond e Sidney Verba.\n\n24\n\nmanter ou alterar os seus governantes e, constituindo assim, a melhor forma de estudo das suas\n\natitudes políticas. Apesar do voto continuar a ser a principal forma de participação política, a sua\n\npopularidade parece seguir uma tendência decrescente nos países desenvolvidos, surgindo a\n\nquestão da existência de um desinteresse cada vez maior na política. No entanto, segundo Dalton,\n\num turnout mais baixo não significa necessariamente menor interesse nem menos conhecimento\n\nsobre política, mas sim uma nova forma de participação. De facto, os eleitores nestes países\n\nparecem desacreditar uma participação que lhes é redutora e procuram formas alternativas de o\n\nfazer.\n\nNo âmbito desta pesquisa, Dalton analisou a participação em eleições (turnout) entre a\n\ndécada de 50 e 90. Aparentemente, o turnout está relacionado com o sistema partidário, sendo\n\nmais elevado em caso de maior polarização ideológica11, a estrutura partidária e o peso e o\n\nnúmero de partidos, assim como com a estrutura legislativa12. O autor faz referência aos estudos\n\nde Lipset e Rokkan (1967), que sugerem duas revoluções: a Revolução Nacional, com o alastrar\n\ndos Estados-nação no séc. XVIII e XIX, que introduziram clivagens baseadas na raça ou grupos\n\nétnicos e no conflito Igreja-Estado; e a Revolução Industrial, no séc. XIX, que foi palco para as\n\nclivagens apoiadas na classe social (proprietários e trabalhadores) e no conflito Terra-Indústria.\n\nEstes quatro aspectos divisórios têm desenhado a maior parte dos conflitos sociais nos países\n\nindustrializados, e muitos partidos tiveram aqui a sua origem - constituindo inicialmente grupos\n\nsociais que, por conveniência, se institucionalizaram. Historicamente, estes conflitos sociais\n\ncostumam ter reflexo nos resultados de eleições futuras, mas aparentemente essa ligação está a\n\nperder-se. Paralelamente, regista-se o surgimento de novos partidos com o propósito de fazer face\n\nàs novas exigências do eleitorado. Dalton separa as clivagens do que chama a Velha Política e a\n\n11\n\nCf. (Powell 1986; Crepaz 1990)\n\n12\n\nCf. Jackman (1987)\n\n25\n\nNova Política. A Velha Esquerda identifica-se com a classe trabalhadora e os sindicatos, os\n\ngrupos seculares e urbanos. Ao mesmo tempo, a Velha Direita defende os empresários e a classe\n\nmédia, muitas vezes com pendor religioso ou rural. Mas a Era pós-industrial trouxe questões que\n\noriginam divisões transversais a estes grupos, onde os rótulos clássicos não encaixam, como é o\n\ncaso da homossexualidade e o ambiente. O autor refere que, nestes países, os partidos ainda\n\nseguem as normas da Velha Política, tentando no entanto abranger estas novas causas. O curso\n\nfuturo é incerto, apesar de se esperarem novos alinhamentos partidários e novas configurações.\n\nNeste seguimento, é relevante analisar as bases sociais associadas ao apoio partidário. Um\n\ncidadão informado toma decisões políticas com base nas suas convicções e no seu discernimento.\n\nNo entanto, as características sociais podem influenciar as decisões individuais de voto, uma vez\n\nque os grupos sociais influenciam os seus elementos também a este nível. Dalton explica que, não\n\nobstante as discrepâncias entre decisões de voto e preferências partidárias serem ainda marcadas\n\npela classe social, regista-se a emergência de uma nova classe entre a classe média e a classe\n\ntrabalhadora. Esta classe, designada “salatariat”, manifesta interesses alternativos e espelha as\n\nnovas configurações sociais nas suas decisões de voto e na sua posição partidária, esta última\n\ncada vez mais ambígua. Adicionalmente, existe outra fonte de divisão no voto - a religião. No\n\nentanto, verifica-se que credos muito diversos alinham-se em ambos os lados do espectro político.\n\nA participação na campanha é encarada como uma extensão do voto. O eleitor que é\n\nmilitante ou apoiante de um partido pode prolongar o seu apoio ao auxiliar o mesmo na corrida\n\neleitoral. No entanto, a análise de Dalton aponta para uma tendência decrescente da fidelidade aos\n\npartidos nos países analisados e, em geral, nos países industrialmente avançados. As relações dos\n\neleitores com os partidos parecem tornar-se cada vez utilitaristas, dependendo mais de posições\n\nem determinados assuntos que os cidadãos querem ver defendidas do que de uma partilha da sua\n\nideologia. Uma possível explicação para este comportamento é o aumento da influência dos\n\nmedia nas eleições, que pode substituir a participação na campanha como fonte de informação.\n\n26\n\nAssim, os media passam de simples intermediários a criadores de opinião pública. Factualmente,\n\nos eleitores denotam uma preferência crescente pela comunicação social como meio de formação\n\ndas suas opiniões políticas, em detrimento de uma participação direta na campanha do partido que\n\napoiam.\n\nA participação em associações cívicas representa o nível mais básico, mais cru, de\n\ndemocracia de raiz, que em inglês é apelidado de “grassroots”. Apesar de, nos países analisados\n\npelo autor, esta participação mostrar-se já intensa, esta parece estar a aumentar e a abranger novas\n\náreas da vida pública. Além disso, os próprios modos de associação são inovadores.\n\n“Quando os cidadãos são impedidos de exercer a sua influência política pelos canais de\n\nparticipação legítimos, a política de protesto é uma opção.” 13 (Dalton, 2008, pág. 48). Nas\n\nsociedades pós-industriais, o protesto tem abrangido uma parcela maior da sociedade, ao mesmo\n\ntempo que são procuradas formas alternativas de o fazer - cada vez mais pacíficas e sistemáticas.\n\nÉ uma forma de expressão política em expansão. Dalton apresenta um diagrama com quatro\n\nníveis de protesto, partindo do mais convencional e aceitável em democracia até ao ilegal e\n\nviolento. Conclui, por fim, que houve um aumento das formas de protesto menos convencionais.\n\nPara tentar perceber as motivações subjacentes aos protestos nestes países, Dalton refere o\n\nmodelo da privação (deprivation approach) que relaciona a origem dos protestos com a\n\n“frustração” e a “alienação política”. Este indica que as pessoas menos instruídas são as que mais\n\nse envolvem em protestos não convencionais. Por outro lado, apresenta também o modelo dos\n\nrecursos14, que encara o protesto como um recurso democrático alternativo. As formas de protesto\n\nmenos convencionais são encaradas como resultantes da competição normal por se tentar fazer\n\nouvir. Contrariamente ao anterior, este modelo aponta para que quem proteste sejam as classes\n\n13\n\nTradução livre de “When citizens are blocked from exercising political influence through legitimate participation channels, protest politics exists as an option.” 14\n\nPara ler mais sobre o Resource model, ler Tilly (1975). 27\n\nmédias e altas e/ou os cidadãos mais esclarecidos. De forma a estudar esta relação, Dalton tem em\n\nconta a educação, a idade, o sexo, as ligações a sindicatos, a satisfação política e o\n\nposicionamento esquerda/direita dos cidadãos. Observa assim que a satisfação política não\n\ndesempenha um papel significativo, uma vez que a maioria dos cidadãos reconhece utilidade no\n\nprotesto, independentemente da sua avaliação do desempenho do Governo. Cidadãos do sexo\n\nmasculino ou mais instruídos são, na verdade, mais propensos a aderir ao protesto. Neste\n\nconjunto de dados empíricos, o resource model encaixa melhor na realidade pós-materialista.\n\nCom a idade, os indivíduos manifestam-se de forma cada vez mais convencional. No entanto,\n\nDalton adiciona que os jovens, cada vez mais instruídos nestes países, intensificam a sua\n\nparticipação política, projetando que isso se reflita mais tarde nas suas vidas. Em suma, as formas\n\nde protesto não-convencionais têm tendência a disseminar-se.\n\nPortugal teve alguns exemplos destas formas mais criativas de manifestação. A título de\n\nexemplo, aconteceu que alguns cidadãos pedissem recibos em nome do Primeiro-Ministro/\n\nMinistro das Finanças, em protesto contra o pacote de medidas de combate à evasão fiscal e em\n\nforma de manifestação de descontentamento contra as medidas de austeridade introduzidas.\n\nAtaques de hackers a páginas oficiais do Governo e dos partidos têm-se tornado mais comuns,\n\natraindo atenção mediática e transmitindo a mensagem de insatisfação de forma muito clara.\n\nEstes protestos não convencionais costumam ser pacíficos e originais, pelo que se espalham\n\nrapidamente e contribuem para uma consciencialização da causa em debate. No entanto,\n\ncontinuam a ser os esquerdistas a levar a cabo mais protestos. Dalton chama atenção para o facto\n\nde que, pelos dados empíricos discutidos, a participação política mostra sinais de intensificação e\n\ndiversificação, ao contrário do assumido anteriormente. O protesto passou a ser amplamente\n\naceite e, partindo daí, generalizou-se. Isto significa que se abriram canais de comunicação\n\nalternativos às elites políticas nestas sociedades. Com isto, intensifica-se a complexidade dos\n\nproblemas e das ligações entre agentes sociais, mais exigências à democracia e ao cidadão, o que\n\n28\n\npode adensar diferenças entre mais e menos instruídos na capacidade de satisfazer as suas\n\nreivindicações. Isto significa que, paradoxalmente, a participação crescente pode ser\n\ncontraproducente para o funcionamento saudável da vida política. Como já referido, a teoria\n\nelitista da democracia defende que a participação política pode ser em demasia e, com isso,\n\ntornar-se prejudicial. Todavia, Dalton sublinha que populações mais esclarecidas e mais\n\ncombativas são um sinal positivo e, muitas vezes, funcionam em prol de uma acção mais\n\ndemocrática. Destaca também a participação em atividades cívicas como uma boa fonte de\n\ninformação e educação, movendo os cidadãos a terem uma ideia progressivamente mais clara dos\n\ndesafios que o seu país enfrenta na esfera política e a procurarem contribuir com soluções\n\nadequadas.\n\nNo meio destes novos comportamentos que surgem, é pertinente analisar o perfil do novo\n\ncidadão. Para os caracterizar, Dalton apresenta o modelo do voluntarismo cívico15, com três tipos\n\nde influência: as características pessoais (relacionado com a posição social, nível de maturidade e\n\nsexo); os efeitos de grupo (ligação a partido político ou associações cívicas); e as atitudes\n\npolíticas (satisfação com o processo democrático e posicionamento à esquerda/direita). Estes\n\ncampos têm a sua própria influência, mas também se inter-relacionam. Uma regressão múltipla dá\n\nconta da influência exercida destes factores sobre três aspectos da participação: o voto, a\n\nparticipação em campanhas e a participação em movimentos cívicos. Conclui-se que o aumento\n\nna sofisticação política não significa necessariamente maior participação em todas as formas\n\nanalisadas. Outra tendência traçada é a de que um eleitorado mais educado pode procurar formas\n\nde participação alternativas ao voto e à campanha, nomeadamente o surgimento de movimentos\n\nsociais/cívicos. As diferenças na participação mostram-se mais qualitativas que quantitativas.\n\nOs valores regem o comportamento humano e estão também frequentemente presentes\n\nnas decisões políticas dos cidadãos. Nas sociedades pós-industriais, os sistemas valorativos têm\n\n15\n\nCf. Verba, Schlozman e Brady (1995)\n\n29\n\nsofrido alterações, “as relações hierárquicas e a deferência perante a autoridade estão a dar\n\nlugar à descentralização, autoexpressão e mais participação nas decisões que afectam a vida do\n\nindivíduo.”16 (Dalton, 2008, pág. 78). Para Dalton, Inglehart (1977, 1990; Abramson e Inglehart\n\n1995) é o autor que fornece uma compreensão mais completa da mudança de valores ao longo das\n\núltimas décadas, distinguindo duas premissas basilares. A primeira é a da escassez, sob a qual os\n\nindivíduos priorizam os seus valores consoante a sua abundância/escassez. Procuram satisfazer\n\nprimeiro as necessidades que se prendem com bens mais escassos, avançando depois para bens\n\nmais abundantes. A segunda é a da socialização, que diz que o contexto pré-adulto condiciona\n\nfortemente os indivíduos nos valores que adoptam para a sua vida. Partindo de Maslow (1954),\n\nInglehart estabelece uma hierarquia de valores, partindo de uma maior preocupação com os\n\nvalores materiais e evoluindo para a questão dos valores pós-materiais, uma vez os primeiros\n\npreenchidos. A ordem estabelecida compreende, por ordem crescente, as necessidades básicas\n\n(comida, água, etc.), a segurança, o sentimento de pertença e, por último, a satisfação intelectual e\n\nestética. Fazendo uso destas distinções, Dalton estabelece uma série de valores materiais e pós materiais que analisa segundo a sua importância nos países pós-industrializados. Identificou\n\nassim uma progressão efetiva dos valores materiais para os pós-materiais, com uma correlação\n\nclara entre o crescimento do Produto Nacional Bruto (PNB) e o peso relativo dos valores pós materiais. Os resultados mostram também que a idade pesa na priorização destes valores, apesar\n\nde estas diferenças se esbaterem com o crescimento económico. A educação é outro factor\n\nimportante - quanto mais educação, maior predominância dos valores pós-materiais. Perspectiva se que estas camadas da população constituam as elites futuras e propaguem os valores pós materiais.\n\n16\n\nTradução livre de “Hierarchical relationships and defense toward authority are giving way to decentralization, self-expression, and more participation in the decisions affecting one’s life.”\n\n30\n\nAs principais mudanças registadas nos valores sociais são menor deferência à autoridade,\n\nmenos dependência das normas sociais e crescente individualismo e liberdade. Os pós materialistas fazem questão de viver nos seus próprios termos e não têm medo de o exigir às\n\nautoridades. A matriz dos assuntos políticos na ordem do dia também parece ser diferente,\n\nmovendo-se para causas mais características do pós-materialismo (ambiente, qualidade de vida,\n\netc.). No entanto, mesmo as matérias que já eram profundamente discutidas, como é o caso da\n\nigualdade social, ganham novas perspectivas. Igualdade social deixa de ter um significado\n\nestritamente material de redistribuição de rendimentos, para passar a tratar-se também dos\n\ndireitos de grupos, como os homossexuais ou a igualdade entre sexos. Os pós-materialistas são\n\nmais ativos na política. Apesar de votarem menos, participam mais, mas de diferentes maneiras.\n\n“Mais pessoas valorizam a oportunidade de participar nas decisões que afectam as suas vidas\n\nmais do que valorizam as instituições e os procedimentos que asseguram a estabilidade e a\n\nordem, em detrimento da potencial contribuição do cidadão”17 (Dalton, 2008). Utilizando esta\n\ndivisão entre valores materiais e pós-materiais, em paralelo com as diferenças entre Velha\n\nPolítica e Nova Política, Dalton descreve duas formas fundamentalmente distintas de fazer\n\npolítica. O autor pensa que estas modificações no tecido político serão benéficas para a\n\ndemocracia: “Os grupos pós-materialistas são agentes da expansão do processo de\n\ndemocratização nas democracias industrializadas”18 (Dalton, 2008).\n\nÀ parte desta evolução de valores, os assuntos mais discutidos dizem respeito à política\n\nque se faz num país. A nível socioeconómico existe, por exemplo, a eterna questão do peso do\n\nEstado na vida comum. As opiniões mostram que os cidadãos continuam a conceber o Estado\n\n17\n\nTradução livre de “More people value the opportunity to participate in the decisions affecting their lives more than they value institutions and procedures that ensure stability and order at the possible cost of citizen input.”\n\n18\n\nTradução livre de “Postmaterial groups are agents for expanding the democratization process in advanced industrial democracies.”\n\n31\n\ncomo o principal fornecedor de garantias e benefícios sociais. Em geral, os cidadãos destes países\n\nquerem pagar menos impostos, mas usufruir de mais despesa pública, um paradoxo comum na\n\nopinião pública. A globalização e a imigração em massa para estes países trouxeram também\n\nnovidades nas questões raciais, étnicas e de igualdade. Observa-se que as divisões e a falta de\n\ntolerância entre grupos étnicos são atitudes em franca redução. A diversidade é bem-vinda e\n\nchega a ser celebrada dentro destes grupos. O mesmo acontece nas diferenças de prestígio, poder\n\ne influência entre homens e mulheres, que se esbatem também neste contexto. Outra questão\n\nmuito popular nestas sociedades é a preocupação ecológica, sendo que a preservação ambiental\n\ntem tomado uma importância cada vez maior nas políticas praticadas. Os seus cidadãos mostram se dispostos a sacrificar crescimento económico em prol de um ambiente mais limpo e são\n\nreivindicativos neste campo, o que é sinalizador desta nova forma de fazer política. No que toca a\n\nquestões sociais que, muitas vezes, envolvem choques de valores, assiste-se a uma evolução no\n\ncaminho da maior abertura, maior secularismo e menor sujeição à autoridade ou às normas\n\nsociais.\n\nAs visões quanto à política externa foram as que sofreram alterações mais profundas. A\n\nordem mundial mudou e, com isso, as preocupações dos cidadãos. A aprovação da ONU e das\n\nsuas missões de paz é praticamente unânime neste conjunto de países. Na Europa, a UE é\n\ngenericamente aceite como um projeto com balanço positivo. Dalton pensa que não há garantias\n\nsobre o rumo das posições sobre a política externa nos países pós-industrializados. No entanto,\n\naponta que estas parecem seguir o caminho da maior cooperação e do internacionalismo. Mesmo\n\ncom os recentes percalços e desentendimentos da cena internacional, a tendência geral parece ser\n\na de um mundo integrado que não poderá negar a necessidade de os países cooperarem mais entre\n\nsi.\n\nQuanto às posições no espectro político Esquerda/Direita têm demonstrado que os países\n\neuropeus posicionam-se mais ao centro, enquanto os EUA são o país mais à direita. Numa\n\n32\n\nperspectiva histórica, as posições políticas parecem seguir uma rota liberal. Contudo, os próprios\n\nconceitos de Esquerda e Direita sofrem mudanças, assim como as causas que defendem, sendo\n\ndifícil ter uma ideia do caminho futuro.\n\nFinalmente, a opinião pública mostra-se mais variada e reivindicativa, pondo novos e\n\ndiversos desafios aos seus governos e procurando influenciar as suas políticas. O que\n\nverdadeiramente se destaca nos assuntos discutidos e ideias defendidas é a sua vertente libertária\n\ne as diferenças na sua essência, mais focada em valores e preocupações pós-materialistas. “Um\n\ndos desafios dos governos contemporâneos é como adaptar o processo democrático a este\n\ndiferente padrão de representação de interesses.”19 (Dalton, 2008, pág. 119).\n\nAntes de Dalton, já Inglehart tinha estudado estes comportamentos nos anos 70, revendo\n\nposteriormente as suas hipóteses e suportando-as com mais dados. Artigos mais recentes\n\natualizam e aprimoram ainda mais a sua informação. Modernization, Cultural Change, and the\n\nPersistence of Traditional Values (2000) e Changing Values among Western Publics from 1970\n\nto 2006 (2008) são dois dos documentos que ajudam a dar um quadro do que pensa e como age\n\neste novo cidadão pós-materialista. Inglehart estabelece o enquadramento teórico inicial do\n\nfenómeno pós-materialista. Os seus trabalhos disponibilizam bastante informação, apoiada pela\n\nformulação de várias hipóteses relativas a comportamentos que se revelaram há décadas. A\n\nantiguidade é apreciada, mas a continuidade é desejável. Nesse sentido, torna-se um importante\n\ncomplemento teórico a Dalton, que tem estudos mais recentes, com uma maior abrangência e\n\nqualidade de dados, e com a revisão de algumas afirmações e hipóteses de Inglehart.\n\nInglehart foi o pioneiro da ideia de pós-materialismo, chamando-lhe Teoria da\n\nModernização Cultural. Nos anos 70, começou a detectar as primeiras mudanças com a geração\n\ndos baby-boomers, cidadãos que cresceram no período de paz prolongada depois da Segunda\n\n19\n\nTradução livre de “One challenge facing contemporary governments is how to adapt the democratic process to this different pattern of interest representation.”\n\n33\n\nGrande Guerra e que viveram sob ameaças à sua sobrevivência, ao contrário dos seus pais. Os\n\nanos 60 (e também ainda os anos 70) foram tempos de uma revolução cultural. Por esta altura\n\nsurgiram formas inovadoras de relacionamento interpessoal, de vida em comunidade e de relação\n\ncom a autoridade, como o movimento hippie e o Maio de 68. Em pano de fundo tinha lugar a\n\nGuerra Fria. Em 2000, o autor tornou a tentar verificar a sua teoria, com dados relativos a um\n\nintervalo de tempo prolongado (3 vagas: 1981/2, 1990/1, 1995/8)20. Reuniu dados de 65 países, o\n\nque representa cerca de 75% da população mundial, para atestar que “o desenvolvimento\n\neconómico tem consequências sistemáticas e, até certo ponto, previsíveis em termos culturais e\n\npolíticos”21 (Inglehart, 2000, pág. 20). O estudo foi feito segundo dois eixos: valores tradicionais/\n\nseculares e valores de subsistência/expressão pessoal. “A industrialização leva à especialização\n\nocupacional, níveis de educação crescentes, níveis de rendimento crescentes e eventualmente\n\nleva a mudanças imprevistas – mudança nas funções associadas ao género, nas atitudes perante\n\na autoridade e nas normas sexuais; taxas de fertilidade decrescentes; participação política mais\n\nabrangente e públicos que são mais dificilmente controlados.”22 (Inglehart, 2000, pág. 21). A\n\nindustrialização proporcionou uma menor dependência dos fenómenos naturais e assegurou a\n\nsobrevivência, pelo que estas sociedades começaram a manifestar outro tipo de preocupações.\n\nAtualmente, há mais energia aplicada na comunicação e a processar informação do que a produzir\n\nbens materiais. A sociedade organiza-se em rede, com mais autonomia na decisão individual e\n\n20\n\nAs estatísticas são provenientes do World Values Survey. Alguns dados adicionais foram tirados do European Values Study, para cobrir alguma da informação em falta no primeiro.\n\n21\n\nTradução livre de “(…) economic development has systematic and, to some extent, predictable cultural and political consequences”.\n\n22\n\nTradução livre de “Industrialization leads to occupational specialization, rising educational levels, rising income levels, and eventually brings unforeseen changes – changes in gender roles, attitudes towards authority and sexual norms; declining fertility rates; broader political participation; and less easily led publics.”\n\n34\n\nênfase na expressão pessoal (um aspecto central). “As suas prioridades valorativas mudam de\n\numa ênfase esmagadora na segurança física e material para um aumento da ênfase no bem-estar\n\nsubjetivo e na qualidade de vida”23 (Inglehart, 1977, 1997, pág. 22). Outra peça central é o nível\n\nde confiança dentro da sociedade, visto como essencial à criação de instituições grandes,\n\ncomplexas e descentralizadas.\n\nNeste campo da evolução cultural, existem duas escolas de pensamento mais\n\npreponderantes: uma que aposta na convergência de valores provocada pela globalização e\n\nmodernização24 e outra que advoga que os valores tradicionais persistem, apesar de alterações\n\neconómicas e políticas. É possível que estejam, de facto, a acontecer as duas coisas ao mesmo\n\ntempo, mas a níveis diferentes. Por um lado, existe uma convergência de valores que resulta da\n\ngrande interação que existe entre quase todas as culturas do mundo e, por outro, esta\n\nuniformização leva ao desejo de preservar certas tradições típicas de cada cultura.\n\nNa sua análise, o autor encontrou diferenças significativas entre países ricos e pobres,\n\nquanto a crenças e normas políticas, sociais e religiosas. As sociedades pré-industriais confirmam\n\na hipótese, apresentando uma grande disseminação de valores tradicionais, de família e\n\npatriarcais, de alta tolerância ao autoritarismo e forte influência religiosa. Os dois eixos\n\ntradição/secularidade e subsistência/expressão pessoal explicam cerca de 70% da variância entre\n\npaíses25. Sobre as sociedades mais tradicionais, Inglehart expressa-se da seguinte forma: “Quase\n\nnunca discutem política (...) Dão mais ênfase à conformidade social do que ao esforço\n\n23\n\nTradução livre de “Their value priorities shift from an overwhelming emphasis on economic and physical security toward an increasing emphasis on subjective well-being and quality-of-life”.\n\n24\n\nDurante muito tempo pensou-se que as sociedades subdesenvolvidas deveriam adoptar os princípios das modernizadas. O Washington Consensus é um bom exemplo de “receitas” pré-definidas de desenvolvimento.\n\n25\n\n35\n\nindividual, acreditam em parâmetros absolutos de bom e mau, apoiam a deferência à autoridade,\n\ntêm níveis elevados de orgulho nacional e uma perspectiva nacionalista.”26 (Inglehart, 2000, pág.\n\n25). Sobre os pós-capitalistas: “Quando a sobrevivência é incerta, a diversidade cultural parece\n\nameaçadora. (...) Pelo contrário, quando a sobrevivência começa a ser garantida, a diversidade\n\nétnica e cultural torna-se crescentemente aceite – com efeito, depois de certo ponto, a\n\ndiversidade não só é tolerada, como pode ser valorizada positivamente por ser interessante e\n\nestimulante.”27 (Inglehart, 2000, pág. 28). Todos estes antagonismos estão muito presentes na\n\ndicotomia materialistas/pós-materialistas. O desenvolvimento económico parece impulsionar as\n\nsociedades nessa direção, independentemente da sua cultura base ou matriz de valores sociais. A\n\nreligião parece perder terreno, mas a herança cultural mantém-se viva nas sociedades,\n\ninfluenciando o modo de transição para o pós-materialismo. A confiança interpessoal está\n\nsignificativamente relacionada com o nível do PIB per capita28. Isto é justificado com uma ideia\n\nde Putnam (1993), que defende que a organização local e horizontal, em pequenos núcleos,\n\nfavorece a confiança no outro, enquanto organizações grandes, centralizadas e hierarquizadas\n\npromovem o contrário. Inglehart interpreta que as diferenças culturais integram uma componente\n\nreligiosa que se dilui na cultura. Diz também que, não obstante a globalização ser uma realidade,\n\nO eixo tradição/secularidade apresenta uma correlação r=0.95 e o de subsistência/expressão pessoal, r=0.96, ambos valores muito elevados (r é o valor da correlação que varia de 0 – nenhuma correlação - a 1máxima correlação).\n\n26\n\nTradução livre de “They seldom or never discuss politics (…) They emphasize social conformity rather than individualistic striving, believe in absolute standards of good and evil, support deference to authority, and have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook. Societies with secular-rational values have the opposite preferences on all these topics.”\n\n27\n\nTradução livre de “When survival is uncertain, cultural diversity seems threatening. (…) Conversely, when survival begins to be taken for granted, ethnic and cultural diversity become increasingly acceptable – indeed, beyond a certain point, diversity is not only tolerated, it may be positively valued because it is interesting and stimulating.”\n\n28\n\nO grau de correlação é r=0,6 (entre 0 e 1).\n\n36\n\no cariz nacional persiste, influenciado pelas instituições educacionais e culturais dessa sociedade.\n\nO nível de educação, surpreendentemente, parece não pesar nestas divisões. Uma combinação de\n\nfactores culturais e económicos parece explicar estas diferenças. Um aspecto interessante é que a\n\nreligião organizada parece estar a perder poder29, ao mesmo tempo que se testemunha um\n\naumento da procura espiritual. O documento recomenda, pois, uma revisão da teoria da\n\nmodernização cultural para que abranja também estes factores mais subjetivos.\n\nMais recentemente, Inglehart (2008) voltou a este assunto, usufruindo de uma série\n\ntemporal ainda mais longa, de forma a rever as linhas básicas da sua teoria da modernização\n\ncultural. Depois de ter sugerido, em 197130, que uma mudança de valores estaria em pauta,\n\nInglehart examinou dados de três décadas, entre 1970 até 200631, para aferir essas alterações\n\nsociais, mediante a dicotomia entre valores materiais e pós-materiais. Os primeiros valores\n\napoiam-se na necessidade de segurança física e económica e os segundos na autonomia e na\n\nautoexpressão. Num desenvolvimento da sua teoria em 197732, adiantou duas premissas que\n\npodem suportar a tendência transformativa das sociedades nos países industrializados: a da\n\nescassez e da socialização, já mencionadas.\n\n29\n\nExiste uma exceção nas sociedades ex-comunistas, que, depois de muitos anos de credo proibido, assistem a um ressurgimento da religião.\n\n30\n\nPara mais informação, ver o artigo The silent revolution in Europe: intergenerational change in post-industrial societies (1971), da autoria de Ronald Inglehart, publicado pela American Political Science Review.\n\n31\n\nAs fontes eleitas para a informação estatística foram o World Values Survey e o Eurobarómetro.\n\n32\n\nDepois do artigo inicial de 1971, Inglehart escreveu um livro The silent revolution: changing values and political styles among Western publics, em 1977, onde desenvolveu, em mais profundidade, o estudo deste fenómeno.\n\n37\n\nO autor sugere que indivíduos que, durante a sua infância/juventude, temeram pela sua\n\nsegurança/sobrevivência, crescem para serem adultos materialistas, que se preocupam com o\n\ndesempenho económico em detrimento de outros valores mais abstractos. Uma vez tomando a\n\nsobrevivência como garantida, os indivíduos tendem a preocupar-se mais com a estética, a\n\ndiversidade e a participação política. “Durante as quatro décadas após 1970, devemos observar\n\numa grande alteração nas motivações destas sociedades, com os pós-materialistas a tornarem-se\n\ntão numerosos quanto os materialistas, trazendo uma correspondente mudança de foco dos\n\nassuntos económicos para uma ênfase crescente na qualidade de vida e na expressão pessoal.”33\n\n(Inglehart, 2008, pág. 133). Isto significa que o crescimento económico ajuda a desencadear uma\n\nmudança nos valores de uma sociedade de materialistas para pós-materialistas. Um pormenor\n\nimportante na tese de Inglehart é que sociedades que sofrem colapsos económicos tendem a\n\ntornar-se mais materialistas, pelo que esta evolução não é irreversível. A modernização é, pois,\n\nprobabilística e não determinista. “A nossa teoria implica que os efeitos negativos de curto prazo, tal como uma recessão, terão tendência a empurrar os grupos [etários] para baixo em\n\nresposta a certas condições; mas com recuperação, eles regressarão ao seu nível anterior, pelo\n\nque no longo-prazo serão tão pós-materialistas quanto no princípio. (…) Mas no longo-prazo, as\n\nflutuações positivas e negativas tendem a cancelar-se mutuamente”34 (Inglehart, 2008, pág. 135).\n\nFactualmente, regista-se uma evolução progressiva da matriz axiológica nos países\n\ndesenvolvidos.\n\nFrequentemente, surge a questão se a idade potencia alterações destas disposições perante a\n\nvida. Nas suas observações iniciais, Inglehart observava que as gerações mais novas davam\n\n33\n\nTradução livre de “(...) during the four decades following 1970, we should observe a major shift in the motivations of these societies, with post-materialists becoming as numerous as materialists, bringing a corresponding shift away from economic issues toward increasing emphasis on quality of life and expressive issues.” 34\n\nTradição livre de “Our theory implies that negative short-term effects such as major recession will tend to push all cohorts downward in response to current conditions; but with recovery, they will return to their former level, so that in the long run they will remain about as post-materialist as they were at the start. (…) But in the long run, positive and negative fluctuations tend to cancel each other out”. 38\n\nmaiores sinais de pós-materialismo. Como tal, havia que descobrir se a importância secundária\n\ndos bens materiais estaria relacionada com a despreocupação natural da juventude ou influenciada\n\npela pouca maturidade que lhe está associada. Existe uma certa tendência para os indivíduos se\n\ntornaram mais materialistas à medida que envelhecem, no entanto não é tão significativa quanto\n\nas mudanças registadas entre faixas etárias. O que é observado é que os valores pós-materialistas\n\nganham importância. No entanto, os valores materialistas podem permanecer nestas sociedades.\n\nNa sua análise, o autor observa que, de facto, os indivíduos não se tornam materialistas com a\n\nidade: “os grupos etários mais jovens permanecem relativamente pós-materialistas, não obstante\n\nas flutuações do curto-prazo, e, num período de mais de 35 anos, não vemos uma tendência para\n\nos elementos de um dado grupo etário se tornarem mais materialistas à medida que envelhecem\n\n– aliás, a maioria dos grupos etários é ligeiramente mais pós-materialista no fim da série\n\ntemporal do que era no princípio.”35 (Inglehart, 2008, pág. 135). Segundo estes resultados, quem\n\né pós-materialista, tem tendência manter estes mesmos valores. O autor encontra também uma\n\ndiferença significativa entre os países de baixo-rendimento ou com disputas internas e os países\n\nde alto-rendimento – nos países de alto-rendimento a adopção de valores pós-materialistas é mais\n\nalargada. Encontra polarizações, segundo os dois eixos essenciais: o da tradição/secular-racional\n\ne o da sobrevivência/autoexpressão. As sociedades agrárias aparecem ligadas aos valores\n\ntradicionais e as sociedades industrializadas são onde proliferam mais os valores seculares racionais.\n\nDistinguindo os dois tipos lado-a-lado, Inglehart explica as características materialistas:\n\n“Sob ameaça de invasão, tumulto interno ou colapso económico, as pessoas procuram figuras de\n\nautoridade que possam protegê-los do perigo. (…) Em condições de insegurança, as pessoas\n\n35\n\nTradução livre de “(...) the younger cohorts remain relatively post-materialist despite short-term fluctuations, and over a period of 35 years we find no overall tendency for the members of given birth cohorts to become more materialist as they age – indeed most cohorts are slightly more post-materialist at the end of this time series that they were at the start.”\n\n39\n\npodem estar dispostas a submeter-se a um governo autoritário, porquanto, com níveis crescentes\n\nde segurança quanto à sua vida, tornam-se menos dispostas a isso. (…) A acumulação\n\neconómica motivada pela segurança económica foi o objectivo central da sociedade industrial.\n\nIronicamente, a sua conquista foi a que pôs em movimento um processo de mudança cultural\n\ngradual que tornou esses objectivos menos centrais – e agora provoca uma rejeição das\n\ninstituições hierárquicas que ajudaram a atingi-la.”36 (Inglehart, 2008, pág. 140). Por outro lado,\n\ndescrevendo as características pós-materialistas: “maior tolerância a grupos exteriores, incluindo\n\nestrangeiros, gays e lésbicas. Os valores da autoexpressão dão grande prioridade à proteção\n\nambiental, tolerância à diversidade e exigências crescentes de participação na tomada de\n\ndecisão na vida económica e política. (...) de ênfase no trabalho árduo para ênfase na\n\nimaginação e tolerância como valores importantes para ensinar a uma criança. (...) confiança\n\ninterpessoal elevada e níveis relativamente elevados de bem-estar subjetivo. (...) abandono da\n\ndeferência a todas as formas de autoridade externa.”37 (Inglehart, 2008, pág. 140).\n\nAs alterações culturais são, portanto, uma realidade, refletindo um processo\n\nintergeracional, associado aos níveis crescentes de segurança e garantia de sobrevivência. Parece\n\nocorrer quando as condições em que dada geração é criada são significativamente melhores que a\n\n36\n\nTradução livre de “Under threat of invasion, internal disorder or economic collapse, people eagerly seek strong authority figures that can protect them from danger. (…) Under conditions of insecurity, people may be willing to submit to authoritarian rule, but with rising levels of existential security they become less willing to do so.(…) Economic accumulation for the sake of economic security was the central goal of industrial society. Ironically, their attainment set in motion a process of gradual cultural change that has made these goals less central – and now is bringing a rejection of the hierarchical institutions that helped attain them.”\n\n37\n\nTradução livre de “(…) broader syndrome of tolerance of outgroups, including foreigners, gays and lesbians. Self-expression values give high priority to environmental protection, tolerance of diversity and rising demands for participation in decision making in economic and political life. (…) from emphasis on hard work toward emphasis on imagination and tolerance as important values to teach a child. (…) high on interpersonal trust and have relatively high levels of subjective well-being. (…) shift away from deference to all forms of external authority.”\n\n40\n\nanterior, e em que a sua segurança é tida como dado adquirido. Apesar de não haver garantia que\n\nisto seja verdade para outras realidade, a expansão das economias emergentes podem levar à\n\nmesma tendência, apesar de esta estar afecta à cultura destes países.\n\nSobre esta matéria, outra referência é Boaventura de Sousa Santos, que escreveu sobre\n\ndemocracia participativa e inclui Portugal em muitos dos seus estudos. Subjetividade, Cidadania\n\ne Emancipação (1991) dá-nos o contexto teórico das transformações sociais na sociedade\n\ncontemporânea, que este autor diagnostica como um desequilíbrio entre regulação e emancipação.\n\nA regulação baseia-se numa junção de três princípios: o do Estado de Hobbes; o do mercado de\n\nLocke e o da comunidade de Rosseau. O desequilíbrio teve origem no desenvolvimento\n\nexacerbado do princípio do mercado, em detrimento dos outros dois. Começou com o capitalismo\n\nliberal; depois foi um pouco refreado pelo EstadoProvidência, introduzindo algum equilíbrio\n\nentre mercado e Estado; mas, mais recentemente, assistiu-se um ressurgimento do capitalismo\n\nliberal, o neoliberalismo. O princípio da comunidade foi marginalizado neste cenário. Por outro\n\nlado, a emancipação assenta em outras três facetas de racionalização e secularização da vida\n\ncomum: a racionalização cognitivo-experimental da ciência e da tecnologia moderna; a\n\nracionalidade moral e a prática do direito moderno; e a racionalidade estético-expressiva das artes\n\ne literaturas modernas. O autor defende que a racionalidade cognitivo-experimental acabou por se\n\nsobrepor às outras, pondo em causa a sua evolução saudável, bem como a evolução das relações\n\ndinâmicas entre elas. A maior expressão do desequilíbrio atual entre estas forças, segundo\n\nBoaventura dos Santos, será a teoria política liberal, cujas duas subjetividades são difíceis de\n\ncompatibilizar: a sociedade vista como um todo na figura do Estado como organismo centralizado\n\ne vista numa perspectiva atomizada, a dos cidadãos autónomos. “O Estado, sendo embora um\n\nsujeito monumental, visa tão-só garantir a segurança da vida (Hobbes) e da propriedade (Locke)\n\ndos indivíduos na prossecução privada dos seus interesses particulares segundo as regras\n\npróprias e naturais da propriedade e do mercado, isto é, da sociedade civil.” (Santos, 1991, pág.\n\n41\n\n138). Assim, a teoria política liberal explicita que (i) indivíduos autónomos e livres não são\n\nnecessariamente considerados cidadãos (o sufrágio universal só se generalizou já na segunda\n\nmetade do século X X), (ii) o conceito de cidadania abrange apenas a de carácter civil e político,\n\nsendo a participação reduzida ao voto, (iii) a visão de Rosseau de comunidade, baseada no\n\ncontrato social (acordo horizontal cidadão-cidadão), foi marginalizada e (iv) concebe a sociedade\n\ncivil como um todo indivisível, concebendo organizações cívicas e empresas como associações\n\nde pessoas equivalentes. O autor diz que o aspecto voluntário desta participação é muito diferente\n\nem associações cívicas (verdadeiramente voluntário) e em empresas (onde não existe grande\n\npoder). Igualmente, denuncia o desequilíbrio entre cidadania e subjetividade: “Ao consistir em\n\ndireitos e deveres, a cidadania enriquece a subjetividade e abre-lhes novos horizontes de\n\nautorrealização, mas, por outro lado, ao fazê-lo por via de direitos e deveres gerais e abstractos\n\nque reduzem a individualidade ao que nela há de universal, transforma os sujeitos em unidades\n\niguais e intercambiáveis no interior de administrações burocráticas públicas e privadas (…) A\n\nigualdade da cidadania colide, assim, com a diferença da subjetividade” (Santos, 1991, pág.\n\n141). Neste sentido, a cidadania não é um todo indivisível, mas compreende muitos tipos\n\ndiferentes de direitos, deveres e instituições - construídas por grupos sociais diferentes, com os\n\nseus processos de desenvolvimento próprios. Na definição liberal de Marshall, “a cidadania é o\n\nconteúdo da pertença igualitária a uma dada comunidade política e afere-se pelos direitos e\n\ndeveres que o constituem e pelas instituições a que dá azo para ser social e politicamente\n\neficaz.” (Santos, 1991, pág. 146). As lutas sociais trouxeram um alargamento da cidadania,\n\nproporcionando redes de segurança social que deram mais espaço à subjetividade. Paralelamente,\n\naumentaram a burocracia, a vigilância sobre os indivíduos, promoveram uma maior atomização\n\ndo espaço urbano. Este último, perdeu, assim, muitas das redes sociais de contacto e interajuda e,\n\nde certa forma, tornou os cidadãos mais dependentes do consumo e da produção, bem como\n\ntransformou o lazer num “gozo programado”. Neste contexto, o autor defende que se desenvolveu\n\numa cultura de “comprar feito”, ou seja, em que a felicidade é oferecida como um pacote de\n\n42\n\nconsumo de bens, não proporcionado o desenvolvimento da vertente emocional. A cidadania sem\n\nsubjetividade convida à uniformização e isso favorece a identificação com os poderes vigentes e,\n\nconsequentemente, o seu domínio perante o cidadão. O autor pensa em novas formas de cidadania\n\nque se concentrem mais em critérios e formas de participação, em vez de em direitos e deveres e\n\nque, com isso, permitam maior subjetividade. “O compromisso social-democrático amarrou de\n\ntal modo os trabalhadores e a população em geral à obsessão e às rotinas da produção e do\n\nconsumo que não deixou nenhum espaço para o exercício da autonomia e da criatividade, com\n\nas manifestações daí decorrentes, desde o absentismo laboral à psiquiatrização do quotidiano.\n\nPor outro lado, a cidadania social e o seu Estado Providência transformaram a solidariedade\n\nsocial numa prestação abstracta de serviços burocráticos benevolentemente repressivos,\n\nconcebidos para dar resposta à crescente atomização da vida social mas, de facto, alimentando se dela e reproduzindo-a de um modo alargado. Por último, o compromisso social-democrático,\n\njá de si assente numa concepção restrita (liberal) do político, acabou, apesar das aparências em\n\nsentido contrário, por reduzir ainda mais o campo político. A diferença qualitativa entre as\n\ndiferentes opções políticas em presença foi reduzida até à quase irrelevância. A representação\n\ndemocrática perdeu o contacto com os anseios e as necessidades da população representada e\n\nfez-se refém dos interesses corporativos poderosos. Com isto, os cidadãos alhearam-se da\n\nrepresentação sem, no entanto, terem desenvolvido novas formas de participação política,\n\nexercitáveis em áreas políticas novas e mais amplas.” (Santos, 1991, pág. 152). O princípio do\n\nmercado colonizou o de Estado. O Estado-Providência alimentou uma visão “fordista” do\n\ntrabalho, em que concepção e execução aparecem separadas e em que a produção perde\n\nrelevância para o consumo. Os ganhos de produtividade desempenham um papel fulcral e\n\ndeterminam tanto o aumento dos salários como o dos benefícios sociais. Com isto, “A aspiração\n\nde autonomia, criatividade e reflexividade é transmutada em privatismo, dessocialização e\n\nnarcisismo” (Santos, 1991, pág. 160). Boaventura dos Santos vê no movimento estudantil dos\n\nanos 60 um bom exemplo desta confrontação de valores, ao contrapor o consumismo e o\n\n43\n\nprodutivismo com uma postura antiprodutivista e pós-materialista. A produção e a reprodução\n\nsocial foram alargadas ao debate e participação política e foi posto um termo à hegemonia dos\n\noperários nas lutas pela emancipação social, legitimando, assim, novos sujeitos sociais\n\ntransversais às classes. Nos anos 80, a Sociologia debruçou-se sobre o surgimento de novos\n\nsujeitos sociais e novos movimentos sociais (NMS), caracterizados por uma parte significativa da\n\npopulação cujos interesses entraram em colisão com a ordem política e social vigente. Ao\n\ncontrário do que acontecia no passado em que as lutas se definiam entre classes, estes NMS são\n\ngrupos sociais tinham como objectivo defenderem os interesses colectivos. Estes movimentos\n\nradicam na sociedade civil e não no Estado e mantêm a sua distância em relação a este último,\n\naos partidos e aos sindicatos tradicionais, apesar de alinharem no jogo da democracia\n\nrepresentativa. Alguns exemplos típicos são os movimentos ecológicos, feministas, antirracistas,\n\nde consumidores e pacifistas. É curioso que, de forma paralela, estes NMS denunciam o domínio\n\nsocial capitalista e criticam a emancipação social socialista (como foi definida por Marx). São\n\ngrupos sociais transclassicistas, que vivem sob um novo paradigma social “menos assente na\n\nriqueza e no bem-estar material do que na cultura e na qualidade de vida” (Santos, 1991, pág.\n\n164). Subjacente a eles, está um fenómeno paradoxal de maior globalização e maior localização,\n\nquer em termos de regulação, quer em termos de emancipação. A regulação social passa a apoiar se nas interações na família, nos espaços públicos e nas relações proporcionadas pela produção\n\n(relações entre colegas da mesma organização). No que toca à emancipação, alguns movimentos\n\ndefendem interesses específicos de um grupo social, mas muitos defendem o interesse colectivo\n\nda Humanidade. A vida quotidiana mostra-se, então, rica em oportunidades de intervenção ou de\n\nluta por uma vida e um mundo melhores. “A novidade dos NMSs não reside na recusa da\n\npolítica mas, ao contrário, no alargamento da política para além do marco liberal da distinção\n\nentre Estado e sociedade civil. (…) Uma nova qualidade de vida pessoal e colectiva assente na\n\nautonomia e no auto-governo, na descentralização e na democracia participativa, no\n\ncooperativismo e na produção socialmente útil.” (Santos, 1991, pág. 170). Estes movimentos dão\n\n44\n\nvida à obrigação política horizontal entre cidadãos, mediante novas formas de participação cívica.\n\nEstas baseiam-se em desenhos político-jurídicos que, ao contrário dos direitos gerais, favoreçam a\n\nautonomia e combatam a dependência burocrática, que “personalizem e localizem as\n\ncompetências interpessoais e colectivas em vez de as sujeitar a padrões abstractos; (…) Daí a\n\npreferência por estruturas descentralizadas, não hierárquicas e fluídas, (…) Daí também a\n\npreferência pela ação política não institucional, fora do compromisso neocorporativista, dirigida\n\nà opinião pública, com forte utilização dos meios de comunicação social, envolvendo quase\n\nsempre atividades de protesto e confiando na mobilização de recursos que elas proporcionam.”\n\n(Santos, 1991, pág. 171). Aprofundam a luta pela cidadania com recurso a métodos diferentes.\n\nBoaventura dos Santos assume-se, contudo, favorável à visão mais optimista e que, apesar de\n\nestes NMSs indicarem progressos, é difícil saber ainda o seu verdadeiro impacto. É também\n\nincerto se a tensão entre a democracia representativa e estas novas maneiras de organização será\n\nbenéfica ou prejudicial. Relativamente a Portugal, o autor explica que os anos do Estado-Novo\n\ncolocaram um sério entrave ao florescimento desta mentalidade, que os velhos movimentos são\n\nnovidade e que os NMSs são, em geral, muito fracos ou inexistentes em determinadas causas. Só\n\nna altura do período revolucionário é que os portugueses despertaram para esta forma de\n\nparticipação. “Devido à revolução, os velhos e novos movimentos sociais nasceram, por assim\n\ndizer, ao mesmo tempo e, durante um curto período, conviveram em regime de grande tensão e\n\ncontradição social, em disputa pela forma de democracia a privilegiar, democracia\n\nrepresentativa ou democracia participativa. (…) Acresce que, sendo nova, a democracia\n\nrepresentativa não esgotou ainda a sua capacidade de mobilização” (Santos, 1991, págs. 174/5).\n\nAcrescenta que, por essa altura, os velhos-novos movimentos sociais se sobrepuseram aos NMSs,\n\no que pode ter sido motivado pela supressão da sua necessidade pelos velhos movimentos, pela\n\nfalta de tradição de luta classicista que se formou entretanto noutras sociedades. Aí, os NMSs\n\ntrouxeram formas inovadoras de organização e de combate aos poderes hegemónicos, tendo\n\n45\n\nconsequências na cultura e agenda política. Mais tarde, os anos 90 foram de aprofundamento\n\ndeste tipo de experiências.\n\nA articulação da tríade subjetividade, cidadania e emancipação aparecem, portanto, como\n\nvértices necessários a um funcionamento saudável da vida comum. Segundo o autor, uma\n\nsociedade saudável tem um equilíbrio entre os três vértices que é difícil de obter numa\n\ndemocracia. Introduz, portanto, uma proposta de uma nova forma de pensar a democracia, uma\n\nnova teoria da democracia ou teoria democrática pós-moderna, que passa pela politização dos\n\nespaços de interação social38, que implica a promoção de autoridade partilhada dentro desses\n\ncontextos. Assim, procura-se revitalizar a cidadania, por meio do reforço do princípio de\n\ncomunidade, da autonomia conjugada com a solidariedade e da igualdade sem a uniformização.\n\nNas suas palavras: “A complementação ou o aprofundamento da democracia representativa\n\natravés de outras formas mais complexas de democracias pode conduzir à elasticização e\n\naumento do máximo de consciência possível, caso em que o capitalismo encontrará um modo de\n\nconvivência com a nova configuração democrática, ou pode conduzir, perante a rigidificação\n\ndesse máximo, a uma ruptura ou, melhor, a uma sucessão de micro-ruturas que apontem para\n\numa ordem social pós-capitalista. (...) A renovação da teoria democrática assenta, antes de\n\nmais, na formulação de critérios democráticos de participação política que não confinem esta ao\n\nacto de votar. Implica, pois, uma articulação entre democracia representativa e democracia\n\nparticipativa.” (Santos, 1991, pág. 179).\n\nNa mesma linha de Dalton e de Inglehart, Pippa Norris escreveu um volume intitulado\n\nDemocratic Phoenix: Reinventing Political Activism (2002). Esta obra analisa, ao mesmo tempo,\n\nabrangente e extensivamente os novos comportamentos da sociedade civil, as suas organizações/\n\nmovimentos de intervenção e os seus mecanismos de eleição. A organização do livro divide-se\n\n38\n\nMais concretamente, o espaço político tradicional da teoria política liberal, que compreende tudo o que se considera cidadania; o espaço doméstico; o espaço laboral (da produção) e o espaço mundial.\n\n46\n\nem três partes: a primeira dedicada a documentar as tendências que surgiram na segunda metade\n\ndo século X X no que diz respeito ao exercício do direito de voto (turnout), e à militância em\n\npartidos e voluntariado em associações cívicas; a segunda analisa que características têm as\n\npessoas que incorrem em cada uma das atividades descritas; na terceira parte, Norris explora os\n\nnovos canais de comunicação, mobilização e envolvimento que os cidadãos procuram nas\n\nsociedades pós-industriais, bem como o impacto da integração das novas tecnologias na\n\ncomunicação das instituições com o público. A autora procura assim teorizar sobre as novas\n\nformas de ativismo que se observam nas sociedades pós-industrializadas, comparar as formas de\n\nparticipação mais populares e examinar a política de protesto entre os grupos de ativistas que\n\nagora surgem - estes “novos cidadãos”. Norris aponta para a necessidade de renovação da teoria\n\nsobre a participação política, uma vez que um aparente desinteresse crescente do eleitorado\n\n(como é o exemplo dos turnouts cada vez mais reduzidos) pode, na realidade, significar uma\n\nrenovação do paradigma de participação cívica. Pelo contrário, os cidadãos parecem estar mais\n\ninteressados em participar e ávidos de dar a sua opinião, procurando oportunidades alternativas\n\npara se fazer ouvir. A autora chega a considerar a emergência de uma nova sociedade civil global\n\nque luta em conjunto por causas que as fronteiras não podem separar.\n\nPippa Norris questiona muito do que se tem dito sobre o aparente desinteresse na política\n\nque se regista nas sociedades pós-industrializadas. De facto, o seu discurso é um pouco diferente\n\ndo de Inglehart e Dalton. Dedica-se a estudar, a uma escala global, os comportamentos dos\n\neleitores atuais, olhando com mais atenção para os votos, os partidos e a natureza do ativismo\n\npolítico, que parece estar a mudar face ao tradicional. Com a ajuda dos dados de desenvolvimento\n\nhumano, Norris conseguiu confirmar a hipótese da tese de modernização cultural avançada por\n\nInglehart. No entanto, afirma que existem mais matizes dentro destes acontecimentos do que se\n\npensa. Noutras regiões do mundo como a Ásia e a América Latina, níveis crescentes de educação\n\ne rendimento traduzem-se em maior participação nas eleições. Nos países europeus pós 47\n\nindustriais, Norris regista uma quebra de curto-prazo nas taxas de turnout, mas diz que esse facto\n\nparece ter sido bastante exagerado ao ser retratado como um afastamento definitivo das\n\npopulações da vida política e que deve ser analisado com circunstâncias conjunturais, mais do\n\nque mudanças sociais a longo-prazo. Adiciona que a suburbanização e o secularismo, entendidos\n\ncomo causas prováveis na teoria da modernização, são de um período temporal que não se\n\ncoaduna com estas variações nas votações. Uma explicação alternativa pode ser a globalização,\n\nque provocou uma erosão do conceito de soberania do Estado-nação ou a generalização dos\n\npartidos catch-all, que, por terem uma ideologia menos marcada, podem ter desincentivado o\n\nvoto. Para Norris, o voto depende mais de uma relação custo-benefício do que da pura falta de\n\ninteresse. Aqui, o desenho das instituições é admitidamente importante para os resultados que se\n\nquerem obter. O turnout é favorecido em países com um sistema eleitoral proporcional, com\n\ndistritos eleitorais reduzidos, com eleições nacionais regulares, mas espaçadas entre si, com\n\npartidos políticos competitivos e concursos presidenciais. Em democracias estabelecidas, Norris\n\nencontrou que a variável que mais impacto (positivo) tem no turnout é a obrigatoriedade, o que\n\nnão acontece em Portugal, nem em nenhuma das outras democracias escolhidas para a análise\n\ncomparativa. De resto, no geral, as motivações para o voto prendem-se muito com a questão\n\nafectiva, isto é, os eleitores fazem-no por dever cívico ou para defender o seu partido ou causa.\n\nDepois de parametrizar outras variáveis relacionadas com o grau de modernização ou o contexto\n\ninstitucional, a estrutura social, as agências mobilizadoras e as atitudes culturais ainda\n\ninfluenciavam muito o turnout de curto-prazo. Da mesma forma, os grupos etários mais jovens\n\nprovaram-se menos passíveis de votarem, em comparação com os de meia-idade. A autora estuda\n\ntambém o impacto dos partidos nesta realidade, pois são uma peça importante no incentivo à\n\nparticipação democrática. Neste âmbito, mais uma vez, assistiu-se a um afastamento dos partidos\n\nnas sociedades pós-industrializadas, mas o caso é diferente nos países emergentes. Norris achou\n\ntambém uma ligação entre a teoria da modernização e a militância em partidos. Diz que os países\n\nonde o acesso à televisão não é ainda universalizado, têm uma probabilidade maior de militância\n\n48\n\nmais acérrima nos partidos. Isto é explicado pela necessidade de mais colaboradores para as\n\ncampanhas cara-a-cara. Num país com meios de comunicação social mais desenvolvidos, há\n\npossibilidades acrescidas de chegar ao eleitorado por essa via, sem necessidade de presença\n\nfísica. Ao nível individual, a autora viu que o interesse, as atitudes políticas e as redes sociais são\n\nmais determinantes para a pertença a partidos do que variáveis como o sexo, idade, classe e\n\neducação. Mais adiante, focando-se no capital social na óptica de Putnam (1993), Norris defende\n\nque o principal contributo para o seu crescimento é a confiança crescente entre indivíduos da\n\nmesma sociedade, ao invés do associativismo, como se sugeria. Na participação em sindicatos\n\n(um dos meios tradicionais de ativismo e associativismo que tem perdido força), a autora liga o\n\nafastamento pontual a razões mais institucionais do que propriamente um afastamento da luta\n\nlaboral. Na religião, assiste-se a uma quebra significativa de seguidores na Europa Ocidental.\n\nNuma perspectiva global, parece haver uma ligação entre as sociedades menos desenvolvidas e\n\numa maior religiosidade. Da mesma forma, pertencer a um sindicato ou a um grupo associado à\n\nIgreja aumenta a probabilidade de votar e de pertencer a outras associações.\n\nNo campo do ativismo político, encontra-se efetivamente uma menor participação no\n\nvoto e nas associações cívicas, mas não no protesto. Esta é uma forma de participação e\n\nmobilização em expansão. As petições, as manifestações e os boicotes têm-se tornado populares e\n\nmuito comuns nas últimas décadas. Isto acontece com especial incidência nas sociedades pós industrializadas e, dentro delas, mais entre os mais educados e com profissões liberais, no\n\nentanto, é um fenómeno geral (mainstream). Para completar, a participação nos chamados Novos\n\nMovimentos Sociais, como Boaventura dos Santos (1991) descreve, está negativamente\n\nrelacionada com o turnout e positivamente com a militância num partido, com o ativismo cívico e\n\no protesto. Tal como outros autores, Norris também adverte para pouca qualidade da base de\n\ndados disponível para se fazer qualquer análise empírica, quando se fala em valores e tendências\n\nsociais, geralmente temas mais abstractos. Para concluir, ressalva que, mesmo que muito\n\n49\n\ncomplexa, a transformação social é visível, sendo uma realidade onde a sociedade mais educada\n\ndeixa para trás ligações a agências de mobilização motivadas por lealdade, para passarem a\n\npraticar a pertença por escolha individual. Com isto, as velhas formas de ativismo não estão\n\nmortas, são sim complementadas por novos métodos, brotando de um desejo do público em ter\n\nmais influência na política do seu país. “Nas sociedades pós-industriais, as gerações mais\n\njovens, em particular, tornaram-se menos dispostas que os seus pais e avós a canalizar as suas\n\nenergias políticas para agências tradicionais como partidos ou igrejas, e mais passíveis de se\n\nexprimir através de uma variedade de atividades de escolha ad hoc, contextuais ou específicas,\n\nprogressivamente por meio de novos movimentos sociais, ativismo cibernáutico e redes políticas\n\ntransnacionais.”39 (Norris, 2002, pág. 222). O ativismo político surge como uma fénix\n\ndemocrática renascida das cinzas, uma forma diferente de interagir em sociedade.\n\nPara completar o contexto destas sociedades em mudança, Peter Drucker, no seu último\n\nlivro intitulado Uma Sociedade Funcional (2012), analisa as novas tendências que se registam no\n\ncomportamento social, a transformação no mercado laboral, bem como as consequências que isso\n\npoderá trazer para o quotidiano. Que mudanças são essas? “Na história ocidental, de tantos em\n\ntantos séculos verifica-se uma transformação profunda. Transpomos aquilo a que chamo «linha\n\ndivisória». No espaço de poucas décadas, toda a sociedade se reorganiza: a sua visão do mundo,\n\nos seus valores básicos, as suas estruturas sociais e políticas, as suas artes e as suas instituições\n\nfundamentais.” (Drucker, 2012, pág. 253). Drucker começa a sua reflexão com uma apreciação\n\nda relação entre o indivíduo e a sociedade. Diferentes modelos de sociedade surgiram ou foram\n\n“experimentados” tendo as suas influências permanecido até hoje. Apesar disto, Drucker pensa\n\nque a verdadeira mudança de paradigma social desde a Revolução Industrial chega agora entre o\n\n39\n\nTradução livre de “In postindustrial societies, the younger generations, in particular, have become less willing than their parents and grandparents to channel their political energies through traditional agencies exemplified by parties and churches, and more likely to express themselves through a variety of ad hoc, contextual, and specific activities of choice, increasingly via new social movements, internet activism, and transnational policy networks.”.\n\n50\n\nfinal do século X X e início do X XI. Chega a sociedade pós-capitalista, a sociedade do\n\nconhecimento. Com a evolução da tecnologia, o assalariado que fazia um trabalho automatizado e\n\ncom pouca responsabilidade transformou-se num ser pensante no qual são delegadas tarefas mais\n\ncomplexas, integrado numa cadeia hierárquica cada vez mais intricada. Não há conhecimentos\n\nmais importantes que outros, cada um tem o seu papel na sociedade, que é virtualmente\n\ninsubstituível, a não ser que por outro profissional com o mesmo tipo de conhecimento. Os cargos\n\ndeixam de estar associados a uma superioridade/inferioridade intrínseca para se reduzirem apenas\n\nà contribuição do indivíduo para uma dada tarefa. Deixa de haver o patrão e o subalterno, para\n\nhaver uma equipa. “A estrutura pluralista moderna é, em termos gerais, independente do\n\ncontrolo político, da constituição política, da teoria social ou da economia, exigindo uma teoria\n\npolítica e social própria. (...) Do funcionário típico de uma grande empresa da atualidade,\n\nespera-se que use a cabeça para tomar decisões e que utilize com responsabilidade os seus\n\nconhecimentos.” (Drucker, 2012, pág. 165). Se já existem este tipo de exigências no local de\n\ntrabalho, porque não também na vida cívica? É o surgimento da chamada sociedade em rede,\n\ncaracterizada por um contacto progressivamente mais complexo, difuso, confuso e\n\nsobrecarregado entre os intervenientes. As organizações tornam-se cada vez maiores e abarcam\n\nmais colaboradores a trabalhar em coordenação. Deixam de se estabelecer de uma forma vertical\n\ncomo antigamente e começam a procurar uma estrutura mais horizontal, em que a tomada de\n\ndecisão é partilhada, mas também o risco e a responsabilidade. Outro aspecto importante é que,\n\nneste contexto, a lealdade dos trabalhadores (cidadãos) tem de ser conquistada e não forçada ou\n\npor ameaça de coerção. Estas sociedades não se fazem de patrões e subordinados, mas de júniores\n\ne séniores e são caracterizadas por uma grande mobilidade social e geográfica. O papel dos\n\nhomens e das mulheres tem tendência a finalmente se equilibrar, pois não existe diferença entre\n\nas capacidades mentais, como havia entre as capacidades físicas. Nesta sociedade, o indivíduo no\n\nseu papel de receptor final, que antes tinha pouca escolha sobre o que recebia como produto,\n\napercebe-se, pela primeira vez, que tem capacidade para tomar responsabilidade sobre o seu\n\n51\n\nimpacto nas fases anteriores da cadeia de produção, e pode mudá-las. Daí, a generalização dos\n\nboicotes e das manifestações. A perspectiva material é tornada secundária. “O dinheiro é tão\n\nimportante para os trabalhadores do conhecimento como para todas as outras pessoas, mas eles\n\nnão o aceitam como referência máxima, nem consideram o dinheiro como substituto do\n\ndesempenho ou da realização profissionais. Num acentuado contraste com os trabalhadores do\n\npassado, para quem um emprego era, acima de tudo, um meio de sustento, a maioria dos\n\ntrabalhadores do conhecimento vê o seu trabalho como uma forma de vida.” (Drucker, 2012,\n\npág. 329). No entanto, num mundo global, de mobilidade intensa, a competição também se pode\n\ntornar feroz e contínua ao longo da vida profissional do indivíduo. Drucker dá a seguinte solução:\n\n“Os trabalhadores do conhecimento precisam, por conseguinte, de desenvolver, de preferência\n\nenquanto ainda são novos, uma vida não competitiva e uma comunidade própria, bem como\n\nalguns interesses paralelos sérios, sejam eles trabalho voluntário na comunidade, tocar na\n\norquestra local ou assumir um papel ativo na administração local, caso vivam numa pequena\n\ncidade. Este interesse externo dar-lhes-á a oportunidade de darem um contributo e de se\n\nrealizarem pessoalmente.” (Drucker, 2012, pág. 331). Isto abrirá espaço para o cidadão se\n\nenvolver mais na sua comunidade e, com isso, na política.\n\n52\n\nCapítulo 2.2. Relação Parlamento-Cidadão\n\nNo que toca à vertente ligada ao estudo das instituições políticas em si, o Parlamento,\n\napesar de ser um órgão central do sistema político numa democracia, é frequentemente remetido\n\npara segundo plano nos estudos de ciência política. Corpo legislativo por excelência, assume\n\nigualmente outros papéis não menos importantes. Os estudos sobre o Parlamento são ainda\n\ninsuficientes em número e em conteúdo. Além do mais, os estudos existentes que se focam na\n\nactividade parlamentar são sobretudo dirigidos à relação com o governo ou com os partidos,\n\ndeixando pouco espaço para aprofundar a ligação entre o Parlamento e o público.\n\nCapítulo 2.2.1. Os Contextos britânico, alemão e espanhol\n\nOs contextos políticos são essenciais para perceber as instituições políticas de cada país. É\n\nimportante conhecer a relação que têm como o seu público. Norton (2002) contribuiu para\n\npreencher este vazio na ciência política na Europa Ocidental. Esta é provavelmente a obra\n\ncomparativa mais completa que há sobre a relação Parlamento-Cidadãos até à data. Em\n\nespecífico, Norton ajuda-nos com uma visão simplificada das relações Parlamento-Cidadão no\n\nReino Unido, Alemanha e Espanha, países presentes na análise comparativa da presente\n\ndissertação.\n\nNorton avança que os parlamentos da Europa Ocidental são muito dominados pelos partidos.\n\nIsto pode, por vezes, truncar a função de escrutínio ao governo; “os parlamentos na Europa\n\nOcidental são normalmente reactivos ou influenciadores de políticas, mais do que activos ou\n\ncriadores de políticas.”40 (Norton, 2002, pág. 1). Segundo as funções parlamentares avançadas\n\n40\n\nTradução livre de “parliaments in western Europe are usually reactive, or policy influencing, bodies rather than active, or policy making, bodies.”\n\n53\n\npor Packenham (1970), deputados que se dedicam a uma representação específica41 cobrem\n\nfunções de estafeta (errand running), ou seja, de “articulação de interesses”. Podem funcionar\n\ntambém como “válvula de segurança” (se a pessoas se sentirem ouvidas, podem nem querer\n\navançar mais com a queixa/problema). Também contribuem para a legitimação, ao tornar público\n\no trabalho no Parlamento ou tornarem-se mais visíveis no seu distrito eleitoral. “Alguma\n\nlegitimidade pode derivar, não só de o membro do parlamento se tornar acessível mas também\n\nsimplesmente por ser visível.”42 (Norton, 2002, pág. 5). O contacto do deputado com o seu\n\ncírculo pode servir de barómetro da opinião pública e alertar o executivo para certos problemas.\n\nPode também trazer-lhe uma vantagem eleitoral. No entanto, alguns dizem que a dedicação ao\n\nseu círculo pode fazê-lo negligenciar o trabalho como parlamentar. Tem de haver um equilíbrio\n\nentre as duas tarefas. Norton defende que o contacto entre o parlamento e os seus cidadãos é\n\nmuito influenciado pela cultura política.\n\nNo Reino Unido, a Câmara dos Comuns é originária do séc. XIII, inicialmente dividida em\n\nCâmara dos Comuns (House of Commons) e Câmara dos Lordes (House of Lords). Aqui se\n\ncriaram os primeiros partidos de que há registo. É um Parlamento bastante pautado pela tradição e\n\nonde a relação entre o deputado e os seus constituintes sempre teve muito peso. As funções\n\nidentificadas dos parlamentares são de: “válvula de segurança”, ao permitir aos cidadãos\n\nexpressarem a sua opinião; fornecedor de informação, quando esclarece dúvidas aos cidadãos;\n\nrepresentante local, em que os deputados participam em eventos locais; advogado, quando dá\n\n41\n\nQuando os parlamentares defendem os interesses de grupos ou indivíduos, em particular. Em oposição, vem a representação geral, em que os membros do parlamento agem em prol da colectividade (ex: partidos).\n\n42\n\nTradução livre de “Some legitimacy may thus derive not only from the member of parliament being accessible but also simply from being visible.”\n\n54\n\napoio a uma dada causa; benfeitor, que dá benefícios ou facilita situações a cidadãos que o\n\npedem; amigo poderoso, sendo que pode intervir em nome do cidadão e promotor dos interesses\n\ncolectivos da população do seu distrito eleitoral.\n\nNos anos 60, chegavam cerca de 10 000 cartas por semana a Westminster. Nos anos 90, eram\n\n40 000 por dia! Entretanto, com a procura a aumentar, foram disponibilizados mais recursos aos\n\ndeputados (secretarial allowance). Foi também introduzido o momento de “surgery”, um tempo\n\ndedicado exclusivamente a receber eleitores do seu círculo eleitoral. Como resultado, os\n\ndeputados passam muito mais tempo por mês no seu distrito, no presente, do que anualmente na\n\nprimeira metade do séc. X X. Entretanto, o sistema já se automatizou. Aos que enviam cartas de\n\nopinião, responde-se a agradecer. Aos que pedem que interceda por eles com algum ministro,\n\nreencaminha-se e, por fim, traz-se o assunto a público na sessão plenária se os esforços anteriores\n\nnão se provarem suficientes. Esta manobra só se usa em último caso. Todavia, é muito útil, uma\n\nvez que a resposta é pública, mais detalhada e fica registada. Dados evidenciam que, em cada\n\nano, entre 150 000 a 250 000 cartas são trocadas entre ministros e deputados.\n\nNos últimos tempos, os MPs têm-se aproximado mais dos seus eleitores. As funções que mais\n\ndesempenham são de “válvula de segurança”, de representante local ou de amigo poderoso. Isto\n\nocupa bastante tempo ao deputado. “A ligação eleitor-deputado é uma parte importante do\n\nprocesso político no Reino Unido. O deputado é o meio de contacto mais importante entre\n\ncidadãos e o governo central no Reino Unido.”43 (Norton, 2002, pág. 29). O contacto entre\n\ndeputado e o seu distrito eleitoral é considerado muito importante pelos dois lados. No entanto, o\n\npúblico pensa ser mais importante do que outras funções de representação do M P. As funções\n\nmais importantes para os deputados são o serviço ao círculo, a protecção do distrito e ajudar as\n\n43\n\nTradução livre de “The constituent-MP link is an important part of the political process in the UK. The MP is the most important means of contact between citizen and central government in the UK.”\n\n55\n\npessoas. Os britânicos costumam conhecer o seu M P. Um estudo44 mostrou que o contacto\n\npromove a percepção de que o MP está a fazer um bom trabalho. Em geral, a percepção é de que\n\no seu MP está a fazer um bom trabalho individual, mas isso não acontece na avaliação do\n\nparlamento como um todo (ou pelo menos, tem um maior desvio-padrão). Uma pequena minoria\n\ncontacta com o seu MP e mais de 1/3 não expressa opinião sobre o assunto. Hoje em dia, espera se que os deputados tratem de assuntos muito variados, alguns bastante complexos, com recursos\n\nlimitados.\n\nNo parlamento inglês, recorrer a petições prova-se um exercício ineficiente. Apesar de\n\nexistirem há muito tempo, não são alvo de debate no parlamento britânico e apenas submetidas a\n\nquem de respeito. Foi sugerido ter pessoal dedicado exclusivamente a elas em 2001, mas até à\n\ndata, não há modificações. O autor menciona que podem ser alvo de expectativas inflacionadas\n\npor parte do público. O trabalho do deputado no distrito tem um custo de oportunidade elevado\n\npara o restante trabalho colectivo em Westminster. No entanto, entre trabalho parlamentar e do\n\ndistrito, em geral, o MP prefere o segundo. Para tal, foram providenciadas as “non-sitting\n\nFridays”45, em que os deputados podem dedicar-se ao seu círculo eleitoral. Esta ligação, na\n\nprática, facilita o contacto cidadão-parlamento e cidadão-governo (com o MP como\n\nintermediário). O lobbying aumentou e constitui grande parte da correspondência dos MPs. O\n\nstress financeiro também pode ter contribuído para o aumento da pressão pública. Houve uma\n\nalteração na forma como os MPs respondem ao contacto dos cidadãos. Antes, eram indiferentes e\n\nabastados. Hoje em dia, são muito mais atentos e modestos. Manter o contacto com os seus\n\ndistritos ajuda a uma boa imagem do trabalho do deputado. Mas o custo de oportunidade é\n\n44\n\nCf. Crewe (1975).\n\n45\n\nAs non-sitting Fridays são 10 sextas-feiras escolhidas em cada período legislativo, em que os deputados são dispensados do Parlamento para poderem dedicar-se aos seus círculos eleitorais.\n\n56\n\nelevado, em termos qualitativos e quantitativos, e há ainda o perigo do localismo. Norton atribui o\n\ndesencantamento do público com o parlamento às emissões televisivas das sessões plenárias, à\n\nfalta de popularidade do governo e à tendência que existe em confundir parlamento com governo.\n\nAinda acrescenta: “o crescimento do sector público pode ter sido necessário mas não o suficiente\n\npara espoletar o contacto com os deputados. O que Inglehart chamou de mobilização cognitiva\n\npor parte dos eleitores é o que proporciona as condições suficientes.”46(Norton, 2002, pág. 39).\n\nO parlamento alemão (Bündestag) é dos mais complexos na Europa. A Alemanha é uma\n\ndemocracia parlamentar, que funciona com o modelo principal-agent47, derivado da teoria\n\neconómica. Isto pode trazer alguns conflitos de interesses (individuais e colectivos) em\n\ncompetição ou de informação assimétrica. A complexidade dos problemas políticos torna difícil a\n\ndecisão pelo voto, já que os principals não conseguem monitorizar toda a actividade dos agents\n\n(ou podem ter uma imagem distorcida das restrições a que os últimos estão sujeitos). Por isso, a\n\nboa comunicação entre uns e outros é tão importante. “A qualidade da relação de representação\n\nentre eleitores e deputados (ou o parlamento como um órgão colectivo) é vista frequentemente\n\ncomo de importância crucial para a legitimidade e estabilidade de um sistema político. Assume se frequentemente que os parlamentos contribuem para a integração da sociedade e para a\n\nlegitimação das decisões políticas, do governo e do regime, ao proporcionarem um fórum\n\ninstitucional para a representação da diversidade social e a expressão de descontentamento.”48\n\n46\n\nTradução livre de “The growth of the public sector may have been necessary but not sufficient to trigger contact with MPs. What Inglehart has termed cognitive mobilization on the part of citizens provided the sufficient conditions.”\n\n47\n\nNo modelo principal-agent, existe um responsável (principal) e um agente. O responsável precisa que o agente faça alguma coisa por si, mas não pode supervisionar ou controlar o agente. Então, cria um sistema de incentivos de tal forma que garanta que o agente tenha interesse em incorrer no comportamento que o responsável deseja.\n\n48\n\n57\n\n(Norton, 2002, pág. 44). A relação entre os cidadãos alemães e o Bündestag baseia-se na Basic\n\nLaw, na Constituição e nas normas formais e informais. Por ser federal, a representação tem 3\n\nníveis: 16 parlamentos de cada estado (Landtag); o Parlamento Federal (Bündestag) e o\n\nParlamento Europeu. O sistema parlamentar está bastante entrosado com o sistema partidário. É\n\ncaracterístico do sistema alemão ter os partidos muito institucionalizados e estão relativamente\n\ndescentralizados. Os líderes regionais têm um poder significativo no processo de representação e\n\nde delegação. Por lei49, os líderes e órgãos executivos têm de prestar contas periodicamente\n\nperante os militantes. Os MPs têm, pois, incentivos para manter o contacto com a sociedade civil\n\ne com os seus distritos. Os que não o fazem são criticados pelos demais.\n\nO sistema eleitoral alemão é de representação proporcional, com dois níveis: um plural, feito\n\npelo meio de candidatos associados a cada distrito e outro onde os partidos mais votados têm\n\ndireito a lugares adicionais, mediante uma lista fechada. Isto foi desenhado numa tentativa de\n\nexacerbar o bom e diminuir o mau do sistema proporcional. Existem 328 distritos eleitorais, que\n\nrepresentam, em média, 120 000 eleitores. Este é o rácio mais desfavorável na UE. Os deputados\n\nrepresentam o país com um todo (656 MPs no Bündestag), mas todos devem ser próximos dos\n\nseus círculos, não obstante a forma como foram eleitos. Assim, um só círculo pode ser\n\nrepresentado por mais do que um deputado. Além disso, os cidadãos também têm acesso a\n\nmembros dos parlamentos dos outros dois níveis. Os deputados do Bündestag consideram que as\n\nsuas funções primárias são de legislação e escrutínio ao governo. A função de escrutínio está\n\nbastante desenvolvida. Várias entidades estão envolvidas, coordenando a sua actividade para\n\nTradução livre de “The quality of the agency relationship between voters and Members of Parliament (or parliament as a collective body) is often believed to be of crucial importance for the legitimacy and stability of a political system. Parliaments are often assumed to contribute to the integration of society and the legitimization of political decisions, government and regime by providing an institutional forum for the representation of societal diversity and the expression of dissent.“\n\n49\n\nPolitical Parties Act, de 1967.\n\n58\n\nmanter o governo em constante cheque. Nisto, o trabalho com o distrito costuma ser relegado\n\npara um papel mais secundário. Não obstante, os deputados consideram-no muito importante e\n\nnele despendem muito do seu tempo. O próprio sistema está desenhado de uma forma que\n\nfavorece tal comportamento. Os MPs são frequentemente contactados por eleitores, na sua\n\nmaioria a nível individual. Para fazer face às necessidades do público, têm acesso a recursos\n\nfinanceiros e tecnológicos. O sucesso eleitoral dos partidos, no entanto, está mais relacionado\n\ncom o desempenho dos líderes nacionais dos partidos e de uma boa gestão dos meios de\n\ncomunicação social do que com o trabalho local feito próximo dos cidadãos. O federalismo\n\npermite uma divisão de trabalho entre os vários níveis legislativos alemães, ou seja, os deputados\n\nregionais tratam mais dos problemas com os eleitores locais, deixando espaço para os do\n\nBündestag e do Parlamento Europeu tratarem dos nacionais ou até supranacionais. Mesmo assim,\n\nos MPs ao nível nacional têm um volume de trabalho considerável. A maioria (79%) declara não\n\nter tempo para as suas vidas privadas e, em geral, sentem-se sobrecarregados.\n\nO Bündestag tem uma Comissão destinada exclusivamente às petições públicas. Este órgão é\n\nautónomo, frequentemente visto como apolítico e tem independência no direito de informação.\n\nPor outro lado, cada processo costuma demorar vários meses. O volume das petições é\n\nsignificativo e assuntos controversos ou potencialmente embaraçosos podem ser travados pelos\n\npartidos. É publicado anualmente um relatório com a natureza das queixas e os seus resultados.\n\nNa Alemanha, o meio preferido para difusão de informação política é a televisão, seguida da\n\nrádio e jornais. O uso destes meios permitiu chegar a todo o país, mas também contribuiu para\n\nexpectativas mais irrealistas perante o Bündestag. Os deputados alemães parecem não ter sofrido\n\num aumento de exigência dos seus eleitores tão forte quanto os britânicos, mas há que referir que\n\nos primeiros têm à disposição outras instituições que se ocupam de uma parte importante deste\n\ntrabalho (é o caso de tribunais administrativos, por exemplo). No entanto, houve um aumento\n\nsignificativo da submissão de petições. Norton conclui que não se relaciona com um Estado mais\n\n59\n\npesado, como refere no caso do parlamento britânico, mas sim com os novos temas tipicamente\n\npós-materialistas, promovidos por iniciativas de cidadãos e novos movimentos sociais. “Assim, o\n\naumento parece ser fruto de uma nova geração de cidadãos mais educados com um grau mais\n\nelevado de mobilização cognitiva, mais confiança na sua eficácia política e, com isso, a\n\nemergência de novos temas na agenda política.”50 (Norton, 2002, pág. 64).\n\nA análise de Norton não cobre o parlamento espanhol, pelo que se recorre a Méndez-Lago e\n\nMartínez (2002). O artigo analisa a percepção da representação no lado dos cidadãos e no lado\n\ndos deputados, bem como o papel desempenhado pelos partidos em Espanha. O estudo concentra se no foco e estilo de representação. O foco refere-se a quem os deputados verdadeiramente\n\nrepresentam. O estilo prende-se com que critérios usam quando tomam decisões sobre legislação.\n\nEspanha foi alvo de interrupções políticas que dificultaram e atrasaram o desenvolvimento de\n\numa cultura democrática. No fim do século XIX, início do séc. X X, a participação das massas na\n\npolítica não foi bem-sucedida, pelo que se iniciou um período ditatorial que durou até aos anos\n\n70. A transição espanhola foi fruto de um pacto entre reformistas do regime franquista (no poder)\n\ne as forças de oposição. A Constituição foi aprovada em 1978. Esta estabelece uma monarquia\n\nconstitucional, com duas câmaras: o Congreso de los Diputados e o Senado. O primeiro\n\nrepresenta a população espanhola como um todo e o segundo destina-se às regiões autónomas em\n\nque o país está dividido. Os senadores (quatro por província) são eleitos por sufrágio directo, num\n\nsistema eleitoral maioritário. Os deputados são eleitos por lista fechada, em regime de\n\nrepresentação proporcional, com distritos eleitorais correspondentes às 17 regiões. O Parlamento\n\nteve um papel central na transição, juntamente com as elites políticas. A forte cultura partidária já\n\nexistia noutras democracias, tendo sido adoptada no novo regime. Mas a representação não é\n\n50\n\nTradução livre de “The increase therefore seems to be the result of a new generation of better educated citizens with a higher degree of cognitive mobilisation, more confidence in their political efficacy and the related emergence of new issues on the political agenda.”\n\n60\n\napenas fruto do historicismo. O sistema eleitoral, a estrutura institucional, a cultura política e a\n\nideologia dos partidos também a influenciam.\n\nPor altura da consolidação democrática, o parlamento teve a sua visibilidade diminuída,\n\ndevido à posição dominante do partido socialista nos anos 80 à entrada na então CEE (actual UE).\n\nTambém então se descentralizou o país com a criação do Estado de las Autonomías, cada uma\n\ncom a sua própria assembleia e governo regional. Nos anos 90, a instituição parlamentar tornou a\n\nganhar relevância num cenário de negociação e coligação. O regulamento da câmara baixa\n\nfavorece mais os grupos parlamentares do que os deputados a título individual. Os partidos têm\n\nem si a tarefa de selecção de novos candidatos. Neste sistema, tal como no português, os partidos\n\nmonopolizam a representação política. No entanto, não são acompanhados de igual apoio\n\npopular. Os níveis de militância e de identificação com um partido são baixos, mas os partidos\n\ncontinuam a ter a última palavra. Os cidadãos espanhóis vêem os seus representantes mais como\n\nnacionais, na sua totalidade (42%), mas uma boa porção ainda os percepciona como\n\nrepresentantes primários do seu distrito eleitoral (28%). Cerca de 24% ainda acha que\n\nrepresentam o seu partido. Do lado dos deputados, estes consideram que representam o país.\n\nPoucos acham que representam os eleitores do seu partido e ainda menos acham que representam\n\no seu partido. Os eleitores não parecem ligar as vontades dos partidos com as suas próprias.\n\nAcham que os deputados são mais influenciados pelos líderes nas suas decisões do que pelos\n\noutros membros do partido, pelos grupos de pressão, pelos eleitores, pelo governo ou até pelos\n\nmédia. “De acordo com estes dados, o público espanhol percepciona um défice de\n\nrepresentatividade e sente que os deputados não prestam muita atenção aos seus problemas.”51\n\n(Méndez-Lago & Martínez, 2002, pág. 73). Quanto à disciplina partidária, os deputados\n\nconcordam que exista, mas a maioria é da opinião que poderia haver alguns assuntos em que o\n\n51\n\nTradução livre de “According to these data the Spanish public perceive a lack of representativeness and do not feel that MPs pay much attention to their problems.”\n\n61\n\ndeputado possa votar de acordo com a sua escolha pessoal. No lado do público, a visão é\n\ncontrária e a tendência parece ser de acharem cada vez mais que os deputados devem agir\n\nconsoante a sua vontade. A consolidação democrática trouxe consigo a profissionalização do\n\ncargo de M P. Cerca de metade dos deputados (54%) concorda com a sua profissionalização, mas\n\nexistem diferenças importantes relacionadas com a ideologia. Os partidos de esquerda concordam\n\nem maior proporção e os da direita são da opinião que os deputados não devem desistir das suas\n\nactividades anteriores para desempenharem as suas funções no parlamento. Os cidadãos revelam se a favor da profissionalização dos MPs (58%).\n\nO contacto com os cidadãos é um tema controverso. Os deputados declaram que contactaram\n\ncom os eleitores (98%), mas apenas 5% dos cidadãos diz ter tido algum contacto com um MP no\n\nmesmo período. O contacto parece, pois, escasso e dirigido apenas a uma pequena porção de\n\neleitores. Os meios preferidos são, por ordem decrescente, as reuniões locais do partido, o\n\ntelefone e o email. Mesmo que pouco frequente, os deputados têm mais contacto com cidadãos\n\nindividuais do que com outros grupos de interesses (ex: sindicatos), grupos profissionais ou\n\nreligiosos. Os média assumem o papel de principal canal de comunicação e fonte de informação,\n\nespecialmente a televisão. Medindo a satisfação, mais uma vez há incongruências entre deputados\n\ne eleitorado. Os primeiros estão, em geral, satisfeitos com o seu trabalho, enquanto o segundo\n\ntransmite descontentamento; “uma tendência consistente nos anos 90, em que mais de metade\n\ndos cidadãos espanhóis achava que os deputados não representavam os interesses dos seus\n\neleitores ou representavam, mas numa perspectiva muito limitada.”52 (Méndez-Lago & Martínez,\n\n2002, pág. 84). Um pormenor interessante é que os mais jovens, não só se mostram mais\n\ndescontentes, mas também têm uma maior percentagem de pessoas sem opinião. Houve vários\n\nescândalos de corrupção que também ajudaram a desacreditar a classe política. Os cidadãos\n\n52\n\nTradução livre de “consistent trend over the 1990s according to which more than half of the Spanish citizens\n\n62\n\npensam que as motivações dos deputados para se candidatarem têm mais que ver com os seus\n\npróprios desejos de poder do que motivações altruístas. No entanto, isto não significa que os\n\npartidos sejam demonizados. O apoio é difuso, mas efectivo. Para terminar, “os sinais desta crise\n\n(descontentamento, falta de bases sociais nos partidos, desconfiança face à política) são\n\nporventura mais distintos em Espanha do que noutras democracias ocidentais estabelecidas. A\n\nfalta de um legado democrático histórico provavelmente alimentou estas tendências, pelo que\n\npartidos e políticos não têm uma base de apoio como a que existe em outros países com um\n\npassado democrático mais prolongado.”53 (Méndez-Lago & Martínez, 2002, pág. 88).\n\nEm suma, os parlamentos têm um peso relativamente central nestes contextos e os partidos\n\ntêm um papel primordial no seu funcionamento. Espanha tem em comum com Portugal o seu\n\npassado ditatorial e o atraso relativo no desenvolvimento de uma cultura política democrática.\n\nMesmo assim, as suas transições foram diferentes, o que terá as suas consequências. Estes\n\nregimes autoritários procuraram desmobilizar a sociedade, desencorajando a participação política\n\ne dificultando uma futura cultura de participação. Também como no cenário português, a classe\n\npolítica espanhola foi alvo de vários escândalos de corrupção, o que contribuiu para o cepticismo.\n\nO Reino Unido e a Alemanha são democracias mais estabelecidas, mas com traços típicos de uma\n\ndemocracia europeia. Têm parlamentos fortes onde os partidos também têm uma posição central.\n\nCapítulo 2.2.2. A Assembleia da República portuguesa\n\nA análise da AR portuguesa, peça central desta dissertação, requer um estudo mais\n\ncuidado. Os estudos aos parlamentos são escassos e, no caso do português, este défice é ainda\n\n53\n\nTradução livre de “The signs of this crisis (discontent, lack of social roots of political parties, distrust in politics) are perhaps more distinct in Spain then they are in other Western established democracies. The lack of historical legacy of democratic practice probably enhanced these tendencies since parties or individual politicians do not have the reservoir of support that they do in other countries with a longer democratic background.”\n\n63\n\nmais evidente. Não obstante, a última década tem sido relativamente mais prolífica no estudo da\n\nrelação entre o público e a Assembleia. Existem dois livros mais marcantes, que são as obras mais\n\ncompletas sobre a Assembleia Portuguesa: Da Legislação à Legitimação: o Papel do Parlamento\n\nPortuguês (2002), uma edição adaptada da tese de doutoramento de Cristina Leston-Bandeira; e\n\nO Parlamento Português: Uma Reforma Necessária (2002), por André Freire, com a colaboração\n\nde outros autores. Cristina Leston-Bandeira tem dedicado muito do seu estudo a instituições\n\npolíticas, com especial foco nos Parlamentos e nos países do Sul da Europa. Tem vários artigos\n\npublicados sobre o Parlamento português, analisando a sua evolução ao longo do tempo e a sua\n\nrelação com os cidadãos. Esta autora veio ajudar a preencher uma lacuna na literatura em ciência\n\npolítica sobre a análise de instituições políticas nestes países, especialmente no estudo dos\n\nParlamentos. Tem contribuido para a compreensão do funcionamento dos parlamentos e a sua\n\nabertura para com o eleitorado. Explora até que ponto os parlamentos estão próximos do seu\n\neleitorado, correspondem às necessidades da população e defendem os seus interesses na\n\niniciativa legislativa. Além disso, os seus artigos são em inglês, o que ajuda a disseminação das\n\nsuas ideias no meio académico e compensa o facto de que a literatura existente seja\n\nmaioritariamente escrita nas línguas originais.\n\nPor sua vez, André Freire tem aprofundado os seus estudos neste tema da abertura das\n\ninstituições, especialmente do parlamento. No livro O Parlamento Português: Uma reforma\n\nnecessária (2002), conta com a contribuição de vários autores: António de Araújo, Cristina\n\nLeston-Bandeira, Marina Costa Lobo e Pedro Magalhães. Trata da Assembleia da República,\n\nanalisando as suas faltas e até que ponto necessita de reforma (cuja conclusão é que precisa).\n\nDentro dessa linha, avança com algumas sugestões de medidas com fim à “dignificação” do\n\nparlamento português. O livro discorre sobre dois défices importantes detectados na AR: o défice\n\nde competência – os deputados estão pouco preparados em termos técnicos para as questões com\n\nque lidam e o défice de identidade – entre povo e deputados. O trabalho dos deputados é\n\n64\n\ndominado pela dicotomia entre dois lados em constante competição: por um lado, a competência\n\ntécnica e, por outro, a representatividade política. O crescimento da comunicação social trouxe\n\noutras fontes de criação de opinião pública, o que pode alimentar a personalização do poder e\n\nprejudicar o estatuto individual dos deputados. Explica que a função tribunícia do parlamento\n\npode estar a ser sequestrada pelas inúmeras colunas de opinião nos jornais e comentários políticos\n\ntelevisivos.\n\nPortugal é uma democracia relativamente recente. Teve a sua democratização em 1974,\n\nabrindo o desfile das transições democráticas da Terceira Vaga de Democratização de Samuel\n\nHuntington. Comparando com a sua vizinha Espanha, teve um processo de democratização mais\n\nincerto e menos consistente. Stepan e Linz (1996) avaliam ambos estes processos exaustivamente.\n\nOs autores consideram que Portugal teve a transição mais incerta e mais passível de regressão:\n\numa transição levada a cabo por militares sem uma estrutura hierárquica rígida. Isto pode\n\nconduzir (muitas vezes acontece) à tentativa de preservação de bolsas de poder por parte dos\n\nmilitares. Isto pode inviabilizar ou atrasar o processo de democratização, ou pior, fazer o país cair\n\nnuma ditadura militar. Espanha, pelo contrário, teve a forma mais segura de transição: o pacto\n\nentre as forças autoritárias e as novas forças democráticas de oposição. Foi um processo\n\nconsistente, que, apesar de alguns momentos de incerteza, manteve-se sempre num caminho\n\nprogressivo na rota da democracia. A forma da transição influencia profundamente o desempenho\n\nposterior do regime. Além disso, ambos os países se encontravam numa posição social e\n\neconómica enfraquecida pela altura das suas transições: “Os países da Europa do Sul eram\n\nestruturalmente capazes e escolheram conscientemente concentrar-se primeiro na política, em\n\nsegundo nas políticas de segurança social e só mais tarde nas reformas estruturais.”54 (Stepan &\n\n54\n\nTradução livre de “The southern European countries were structurally able and consciously chose to concentrate first on politics, second on social welfare policies, and only later on structural economic reforms.”\n\n65\n\nLinz, 1996, pág. 139); o que os autores consideram a sequência óptima para este tipo de\n\ntransformação num país. Espanha defrontou problemas de coesão social adicionais.\n\nPortugal tem uma tradição democrática pouco consistente. As primeiras tentativas no\n\nprincípio do século X X foram mal-sucedidas e retomadas só em 1974. Desde então, a democracia\n\nportuguesa tem percorrido um caminho mais suave, não sem os seus sobressaltos. O papel da AR\n\nnos primeiros anos de democracia foi crucial, devido à sua contribuição na criação das primeiras\n\nleis de estruturação do sistema político e sócio-económico. Recuando um pouco, numa análise\n\naos primeiros 20 anos do funcionamento da Assembleia em Portugal, Leston-Bandeira (2001)\n\ndestaca uma primeira década bastante conturbada, em que a democracia procurou consolidar-se,\n\nmas foi constrangida pela cultura política ainda imberbe, a falta de profissionalização das figuras\n\nno seu centro e o passado autoritário. Depois dessa, seguiu-se uma década marcada por uma\n\nestabilidade mais tranquilizadora. Efectuaram-se mudanças na direcção da democracia\n\nplenamente funcional, garantindo que o regime permaneceria, independentemente das\n\ndificuldades. Leston-Bandeira refere-se à cultura política portuguesa da seguinte forma: “A\n\ncultura política provavelmente não se desenvolveu da mesma forma que as instituições políticas\n\ne a profissionalização da política em Portugal ainda está longe de ser uma realidade. Depois de\n\nduas décadas, o hiato entre as instituições políticas e a cultura política permanece a\n\ncaracterística dominante que mostra a inexperiência da democracia portuguesa.”55 (Leston Bandeira, 2001, pág. 154). Os constitucionalistas portugueses tentaram conferir uma estrutura\n\npartidária forte ao regime português aquando da democratização, numa tentativa de amenizar\n\nestes efeitos. Por isso, Portugal usufrui de um sistema partidário forte e estável. Isso, por um lado,\n\né bom, pois é uma componente essencial para a estabilidade política. Por outro, pode bloquear um\n\n55\n\nTradução livre de “Political culture has probably not developed in the same way as political institutions and professionalisation of politics in Portugal is still a long way from reality. After two decades, the gap between the political institutions and the political culture remains the main characteristic showing the newness of Portuguese democracy.”\n\n66\n\npouco a comunicação entre os cidadãos e as instituições, sendo que ela é feita, quase\n\nexclusivamente, através dos partidos (no caso da AR, através dos grupos parlamentares) que\n\npodem, por vezes, agir como constrangimentos, mais do que facilitadores.\n\nNa legislatura em que houve maioria do PSD 56, houve um certo recuo do peso da\n\nAssembleia, acompanhado de uma perda de visibilidade nos média e uma imagem mais negativa\n\ndos deputados. Desde então, tem havido um desenvolvimento de ambas as funções da AR, como\n\narena e como transformadora57, “A prática, desde então, mostrou que o parlamento tem\n\nrespondido muito mais imediata e directamente às contribuições da sociedade.”58 (Leston Bandeira, 2001, pág. 154). A Assembleia fortaleceu-se e viu aumentar o seu papel de instituição\n\nde legitimação, quando antes se cingia mais ao de legislação. Todavia, esta evolução não foi\n\nacompanhada por um aumento nas capacidades humanas e materiais, cuja mera sugestão costuma\n\nser muito criticada pela opinião pública. A cultura política das primeiras décadas de democracia\n\nparece não se ter desenvolvido tanto quanto as instituições.\n\nO sistema político português é considerado semi-presidencial. Desde 1976, ano da primeira\n\nversão da Constituição Portuguesa, houve 7 revisões constitucionais. A primeira em 1982, foi\n\numa tentativa de retirar o pesado cariz ideológico presente devido ao ambiente que se vivia\n\n56\n\nO primeiro-ministro de então era Cavaco Silva, conhecido pelo cavaquismo, um estilo de liderança bastante pragmático e de cariz neo-liberal. O seu executivo tencionava levar a cabo reformas que encontraram muita resistência na Assembleia da República.\n\n57\n\nA assembleia como arena significa que a legislatura é controlada externamente, geralmente pelos partidos políticos. A assembleia transformadora implica que a legislatura é controlada de dentro, geralmente pelas comissões e grupos parlamentares.\n\n58\n\nTradução livre de “Pratice since has shown parliament responding in a much more immediate and direct way to\n\n67\n\naquando da criação da versão inicial de 1976. Outra, em 1989, de modo a liberalizar a economia.\n\nNovamente em 1992 e em 1997, para adaptar o texto constitucional aos tratados europeus de\n\nMaastricht e Amesterdão. Em 2001, a revisão destinou-se a incorporar a Convenção do Tribunal\n\nPenal Internacional. A de 2004 alterou o estatuto das Regiões Autónomas e, finalmente, em 2005,\n\na última serviu para estabelecer condições de aprofundar a União Europeia. Uma nova revisão\n\nestá a ser preparada desde 2010, mas ainda não concluída. O Parlamento português é constituído\n\npor uma câmara única, a Assembleia da República, que desempenha um papel central na criação\n\nde legislação e de controlo ao executivo. Actualmente, tem 230 deputados, cuja eleição se faz\n\natravés de um sistema de lista com representação proporcional (método de Hondt).\n\n“O sistema político não favorece uma relação próxima entre parlamento e cidadão.”\n\n(Leston-Bandeira, 2002, pág. 145). A principal causa disto é este sistema eleitoral que se mantém\n\ninalterado desde 1976. O sistema eleitoral condiciona a organização dos partidos em distritais\n\ncoincidentes com os círculos, mais ou menos centralizada, consoante o partido. Os círculos\n\neleitorais dificultam o contacto entre deputados e cidadãos. Aliás, o artigo 152º explicita que os\n\ndeputados não representam apenas o seu círculo mas, sim, o país todo, numa tentativa de\n\ncombater o caciquismo que grassava em décadas anteriores. Os círculos são de diferentes\n\ndimensões e é difícil identificar os candidatos. Ao mesmo tempo, o sistema eleitoral favorece a\n\ncompetição dentro do partido, pelo que pode fomentar o faccionalismo. Nos círculos maiores, há\n\npouco incentivo à comunicação entre deputados e cidadãos. A possibilidade de mudança de\n\nsistema eleitoral tem sido discutida desde os primeiros anos de democracia, a fim de aumentar a\n\ngovernabilidade (facilitar a formação de maiorias absolutas) e aproximar os deputados/candidatos\n\ndos cidadãos. A primeira dificuldade foi colmatada (há mais estabilidade no presente), mas a\n\nsegunda preocupação ainda se mantém. A intenção é mudar para um sistema misto, com pendor\n\nproporcional, uns defendem, ou com pendor maioritário, outros preferem. Mas não se consegue\n\nchegar a um consenso. Outro aspecto apontado é a fraca profissionalização dos deputados\n\n68\n\nportugueses. Bons candidatos dão bons deputados e podem vir a dar bons membros do governo.\n\nO recrutamento parlamentar parece dar a mesma hipótese a muitos, ou seja, parece ser aberto à\n\nparticipação, no entanto, isso é só à primeira vista. Na realidade, os candidatos são escolhidos\n\npelos partidos políticos e ainda têm de obedecer a regras do sistema eleitoral que podem trazer\n\nmais exigências. Eles rodam muito ao longo de um mandato e poucos se dedicam exclusivamente\n\na carreira de deputado. Este problema tem-se amenizado depois das maiorias. O sistema de\n\nsubstituições, apesar de mais restrito agora, possibilita a eleição de candidatos que nunca chegam\n\na ocupar o cargo59. A revisão constitucional em 1997 introduziu a possibilidade de criar círculos\n\nuninominais em conjugação com a representação proporcional60. Qualquer reforma nesse sentido\n\nimplicaria uma descentralização da escolha dos deputados, a qual terá sempre resistência. No\n\nentanto, pode ser bom, pois pode dar origem a uma democratização do recrutamento. Numa\n\navaliação do grau de democratização no recrutamento, Portugal aparece com a classificação de\n\n“Fraca”; a Alemanha com “Média/Fraca”; o Reino Unido com uma democratização “Média” e a\n\nEspanha com “Fraca”61. Caracterizando os deputados na AR, são na sua maioria, homens,\n\ninstruídos, de meia-idade. Recentes evoluções mostram uma tendência em aumentar o número de\n\nmulheres e de nível de instrução. Ultimamente, os deputados têm envelhecido. Isto pode ser\n\nconsiderado benéfico no sentido de uma profissionalização mais consistente da carreira de\n\nparlamentar, mas também pode significar entraves à entrada de sangue novo. Pode estar a\n\nacontecer uma conjugação dos dois fenómenos. Um bom indicador para aferir a\n\n59\n\nOs partidos fazem isto frequentemente. Levam em campanha as suas figuras mais carismáticas para recolherem votos que, depois de eleitas, cedem o seu lugar a um outro elemento do partido com muito menor notoriedade.\n\n60\n\nCRP, Artigo 149º.\n\n61\n\nQuadro nº 9, pág. 94, em O Parlamento Português: Uma reforma necessária (2002), de André Freire. Existem\n\n69\n\ninstitucionalização do parlamento é a experiência anterior dos deputados. Nos dados de 2001,\n\nmuitos deputados já tinham cumprido mandatos nas autarquias ou mesmo na AR. Nesse ano,\n\nentraram muitos novos deputados. A profissionalização parece não ser muito estabelecida,\n\ncontudo o facto de os deputados não poderem desempenhar cargos no governo ao mesmo tempo\n\npode ter a sua influência. A partir da VI Legislatura, se avaliarmos os parlamentares com alguma\n\nexperiência anterior (indiscriminada), o valor ascende a 80%. As alterações ao estatuto dos\n\ndeputados têm sido num sentido de conferir mais estabilidade ao cumprimento dos mandatos e\n\nincentivar a profissionalização da carreira de parlamentar. Freire (2002) defende que poderia ser\n\nbom permitir a sobreposição do mandato na AR com um cargo no governo. As regras sobre\n\nausências são claras e rigorosas, no entanto dificilmente cumpridas pela falta de aplicação de\n\nsanções. Existe também muita incompreensão por parte da opinião pública face aos deputados.\n\nMuitas vezes não estão presentes nas sessões plenárias, mas apenas porque estão a trabalhar nas\n\ncomissões especializadas. Não obstante, o abstencionismo é uma realidade na AR.\n\nNa estrutura da AR, existem duas características centrais: a democraticidade recente e a\n\ncentralidade dos grupos parlamentares. Leston-Bandeira (2002) explica que o sistema de\n\nrepresentação proporcional (Hondt) e o facto de as listas serem formadas exclusivamente pelos\n\npartidos de forma centralizada favorece esta organização. Dentro do parlamento, as facções\n\ndividem-se por grupos parlamentares que são coincidentes com os partidos. A disciplina\n\npartidária é bastante rígida. Os independentes são os que saíram por não concordarem mais com a\n\nsua acção, contudo são penalizados por menos oportunidades em participar. Além disso, os\n\ndeputados não representam apenas o seu círculo eleitoral, mas sim o país, num todo. A\n\nConstituição Portuguesa é das que mais detalhadamente descreve poderes/direitos exclusivos dos\n\ngrupos parlamentares (GPs)62. Todo o quotidiano gira à volta desta configuração. Os deputados\n\n62\n\nFixar a ordem do dia ou fazer uma interpelação ao governo são dois exemplos.\n\n70\n\nsão quase que como “simples delegados do partido” (Leston-Bandeira, 2002, pág. 78). Na\n\nConferência dos Líderes, os GPs negoceiam e decidem sobre os principais pontos de discussão na\n\nAR. Essa é a que tem o poder real apesar de formalmente ser a Mesa o órgão mais poderoso.\n\nAlém das revisões constitucionais, também foram sendo efectuadas revisões frequentes aos\n\nprocedimentos internos da Assembleia, ao longo dos anos (sensivelmente, a cada dois ou três\n\nanos). Sinais óbvios de uma democracia recente são ter muitos documentos normativos com\n\npráticas ainda não muito sedimentadas e a quantidade de alterações que os mesmos já sofreram.\n\nAs grandes alterações operadas nos regimentos foram sempre em alturas de maioria parlamentar.\n\nAs mais profundas, durante a maioria absoluta. As revisões têm sido num intuito racionalizador\n\nem relação ao trabalho e ao tempo despendido. O plenário tem perdido relevância em detrimento\n\ndas comissões. À medida que estas foram acontecendo, as comissões parlamentares foram\n\nadquirindo mais peso63. O trabalho da Assembleia passou de um debate que acontecia apenas na\n\ngrande câmara para ser dividido entre esta e as comissões. Procedeu-se, assim, a uma\n\nracionalização da actividade parlamentar. Desde 1993, muitas das reuniões das comissões foram\n\nabertas aos média (são abertas à comunicação social, mas não ao público, em geral). Foi\n\nintroduzido o debate periódico do Estado da Nação, que procura dar oportunidade para os\n\ndeputados inquirirem o governo, “o plenário tende a preencher uma função de legitimação mais\n\ndo que uma de legislação.”64 (Leston-Bandeira, 2001, pág. 144). Nas duas primeiras décadas de\n\nfuncionamento, a proporção entre leis aprovadas provenientes da própria Assembleia e do\n\nGoverno mudou em favor deste último, denunciando que a AR era dominada no que toca à\n\n63\n\nProgressivamente, as comissões começaram a poder reunir-se ao mesmo tempo que o Plenário (1985); foi-lhes atribuída a segunda leitura (1988); deixaram de precisar do consentimento do Presidente da Assembleia em algumas decisões e foi-lhes permitido encomendar estudos e contratar investigadores. para dar alguns exemplos.\n\n64\n\nTradução livre de “(...) the plenary has tendend to fulfil a legitimation function rather than a legislative one.”\n\n71\n\niniciativa legislativa. No entanto, Leston-Bandeira sublinha que muita desta legislação constituía\n\napenas regulação realizada pelo governo (estatutos reguladores), resultante de legislação criada\n\nanteriormente pela AR. Apesar disso, estas leis continuam a estar fora da esfera de controlo\n\nparlamentar na forma em que são redigidas.\n\nNo seu livro mencionado anteriormente, Leston-Bandeira (2002) avalia a Assembleia da\n\nRepública portuguesa de 1983 a 1995, mais concretamente a V Legislatura, que se denotou por\n\nter uma maioria absoluta e, por isso, tornou-se um bom caso de estudo dentro do panorama\n\nportuguês. A AR estava mais apagada neste período face ao poder crescente dos partidos e do\n\ngoverno. O enquadramento teórico contou com as contribuições de Packenham (1970), Norton\n\n(1990b) e Mezey (1979). Do primeiro autor, retirou um esquema das várias funções que o\n\nparlamento pode desempenhar65: legitimação; recrutamento, socialização e formação; e decisão\n\npolítica ou influência. Packenham conclui que a tarefa de legitimação é a que parece de maior\n\nutilidade, apesar de a legislativa ser aparentemente mais imediata para a AR. Em segundo lugar, a\n\ntipologia de Mezey ajuda a classificar os parlamentos, consoante duas dimensões: o policy making e o apoio. Dentro dessa última, há 3 graus de poder: “Forte: o parlamento pode\n\nmodificar e rejeitar as propostas do executivo; Moderado: o parlamento não tem capacidade\n\npara rejeitar as propostas do executivo, mas não consegue modificá-las; e Pouco ou nenhum: o\n\nparlamento não consegue modificar, nem rejeitar as propostas do executivo.” (Leston-Bandeira,\n\n2002, pág. 31). Mais tarde, Norton aprimorou estas noções e desenhou uma tipologia mais\n\ncerteira:\n\na. Parlamentos produtores (policy-making legislatures): que conseguem modificar ou\n\nrejeitar as medidas governamentais, assim como substituí-las pelas próprias propostas que\n\nformulam.\n\n65\n\nEstes processos desdobram-se em outros onze, que estão sistematizadas numa tabela de Norton (1990b).\n\n72\n\nb. Parlamentos influenciadores (policy-influencing legislatures): que conseguem modificar\n\nou rejeitar as medidas apresentadas pelo executivo mas não conseguem substituí-las pelas\n\nsuas próprias propostas.\n\nc. Parlamentos com pouco ou nenhum impacto (legislatures with little or no policy affect):\n\nque não conseguem nem modificar ou rejeitar as medidas apresentadas pelo executivo, nem\n\nsubstituí-las pelas suas próprias propostas.\n\nSegundo a tipologia de Norton, a AR terá sido: um parlamento influenciador (na III\n\nLegislatura); um parlamento produtor (na IV Legislatura), e um parlamento com pouco ou\n\nnenhum impacto (nas V e VI Legislaturas). No entanto, a autora defende que a verdadeira\n\nmudança deu-se no seu papel primordial. A função de legitimação é encarada como inerente à\n\ninstituição parlamentar, mas, só a partir da V Legislatura, com a falta de voz que sofreu por via da\n\nmaioria absoluta, a AR conseguiu finalmente assumir concretamente esse papel. Além dos\n\nautores apontados por Leston-Bandeira no seu livro (editado no ano anterior), o Freire também\n\nmenciona Polsby (1975) com as suas legislaturas arena e transformativa.\n\nOs recursos da AR, apesar de terem sofrido uma grande melhoria nos últimos anos, ainda\n\nestão aquém do nível de outros países da Europa Ocidental. Existe um plano para um Centro de\n\nEstudos Parlamentares, mas que ainda não foi concretizado. Em termos de investigação e apoio\n\ntécnico, existem ainda faltas substanciais. A biblioteca e os serviços de informação eram pouco\n\nutilizados pelos deputados à data. Os estudos analíticos são em quantidade reduzida e quase todos\n\nde uma perspectiva jurídica. Cada comissão parlamentar tem direito a pelo menos um assistente\n\nespecializado. Na revisão do regulamento de 1993, as comissões passaram a ter o poder de\n\ncontratar assessores técnicos, mas acabaram por reutilizar recursos já existentes de outros\n\nserviços. Quanto aos GPs, só os maiores têm direito a pessoal administrativo. Em 2000, foi\n\ninaugurado um novo edifício que concedeu mais espaço para trabalhar. Entre 1983-95, o nº de\n\n73\n\ncomissões variou entre 11 e 14 e o nº médio de deputados foi de 23.3 por cada uma. A duração\n\ndos debates diminuiu, quer seja por redução explícita, quer seja por se ter dado o poder à\n\nConferência de Líderes de estabelecer a duração dos debates. “Por outro lado, a experiência das\n\nmaiorias absolutas realçou por seu turno a necessidade de se criarem mais oportunidades para a\n\ndiscussão de assuntos da actualidade num fórum público. É neste contexto que o plenário tem\n\ndesempenhado cada vez mais uma função de legitimação, em vez de uma função legislativa.”\n\n(Leston-Bandeira, 2002, pág. 91). Foram criados: o debate de urgência, o debate sobre assuntos\n\nda actualidade, o debate das comissões especializadas e o estado da nação. Outro aspecto que\n\ndenota a racionalização é a transformação de muitos critérios consensuais em maioritários na\n\ndistribuição de direitos e responsabilidades. Os debates plenários passaram a ser muito mais\n\ndeterminados pela Conferência de Líderes e os GPs maiores passaram a ter vantagem sobre os\n\nmais pequenos no tempo atribuído e número de perguntas permitido. A quantidade de projectos lei apresentados, aprovados e rejeitados tem aumentado. Em 2002, o número de propostas-de-lei\n\n(PPLs) era menor que o de projectos-de-lei PJLs, mas as primeiras são quase todas aprovadas.\n\nPor outro lado, os decretos-lei são muito mais abundantes que as leis. A análise de aprovação,\n\nrejeição e ratificação dos decretos-lei demonstra que, sem maioria no parlamento, a AR consegue\n\nainda restringir algum do poder do governo.\n\nOs estudos de Leston-Bandeira (2002) mostram-nos que as conturbações da Monarquia\n\nConstitucional e da I República deixaram um legado de corrupção e, mais concretamente do\n\ncaciquismo, na política portuguesa. O Estado Novo, por sua vez, actuou numa despolitização da\n\nsociedade que foi bastante eficaz. Como resultado, no presente, o escrutínio ao desempenho das\n\ninstituições políticas portuguesas é muitas vezes encarado como autoritário, associado com a\n\ncensura e o interrogatório. No passado, era comum ser usado só em caso de gravidade extrema,\n\nquando o governo (ou mesmo o regime) era posto em causa e não era encarado como algo\n\nquotidiano. O controlo do governo e da administração pública não era considerado algo a ser\n\n74\n\nincorporado na actividade normal do parlamento. Apesar das melhorias nestes “maus hábitos”, a\n\ncultura política e o envolvimento nas instituições por parte dos cidadãos foi afectada e é de difícil\n\nrecuperação. Porém, isso tem mudado nas últimas décadas. O escrutínio ao executivo tem-se\n\nimposto, não só na quantidade, como também na qualidade.\n\nI. A supervisão\n\nInicialmente, a AR foi criada com um intuito legislativo. A função de fiscalização era\n\nfracamente regulamentada e os mecanismos que existiam (moção de censura e interpelações)\n\neram consideradas instrumentos de último recurso. “De certa forma, a função de controle era\n\nencarada como uma garantia de democracia, e não como uma prática da democracia. “ (Leston Bandeira, 2002, pág. 125). Esta visão mudou muito desde então. Nos anos 90, a fiscalização\n\ntornou-se rotina e não só. Também foi através dela que a AR se abriu ao público em busca de\n\nsatisfazer a necessidade de legitimação. Isto foi proporcionado pelas maiorias absolutas, que\n\ndespertaram os deputados para a necessidade de estabilidade política. “Foi nesse contexto que se\n\ndesenvolveu um conjunto de iniciativas visando, por um lado, institucionalizar a profissão de\n\ndeputado e, por outro, aproximar os cidadãos do parlamento; prestou-se, nomeadamente, uma\n\natenção particular ao instrumento da petição.” (Leston-Bandeira, 2002, pág. 126). Os métodos\n\nde controlo tradicionais revelaram-se insatisfatórios, pelo que se criaram formas de escrutínio\n\ncomplementares nas legislaturas com maiorias absolutas. Estas passam por duas vertentes\n\ndiferentes: por um lado, a promoção do debate público e, por outro, o reforço da função de\n\ninformação da AR.\n\nOs instrumentos de fiscalização disponibilizados à AR são: a moção de rejeição; a moção\n\nde censura; a moção de confiança; a moção de rejeição do programa do governo; o voto de\n\nconfiança pedido pelo governo; os requerimentos; as perguntas ao governo; as interpelações, os\n\n75\n\ninquéritos parlamentares e as comissões de inquérito. Além disso, também existe um debate sobre\n\no Programa do Governo (10 dias após a nomeação do PM), o debate da Conta geral do Estado\n\n(apreciação de um relatório com as contas do Estado no final de cada ano civil), a apreciação de\n\nrelatórios de entidades externas (Segurança Interna e Provedor de Justiça, por exemplo) e a\n\napreciação de decretos-lei (a AR pode corrigir deficiências na lei do governo). A moção de\n\nrejeição só foi usada com eficácia uma vez, em 1978. Os requerimentos sempre foram usados,\n\nmas com uma taxa de resposta muito baixa pelo governo (cerca de 37% na VI Legislatura). A\n\nalteração na legislação permitiu melhorar esses mecanismos. Na VII Legislatura, a taxa chegou\n\naos 65%. As perguntas ao governo são o instrumento mais criticado. O regulamento neste sentido\n\né ainda demasiado rígido e previsível para ter algum impacto significativo. Foi melhorando mas\n\nestá aquém dos seus parceiros europeus. “As críticas centraram-se nas perguntas ao governo.\n\nSão consideradas demasiado irregulares, demasiado esporádicas e demasiado ineficazes. Além\n\ndisso, o governo pode escolher as perguntas que quer responder. (…) cada grupo pode propor\n\napenas duas interpelações por ano – e não permitem uma resposta rápida a tópicos do dia. (…)\n\nApesar de os comités de inquérito portugueses usufruírem de poderes alargados de investigação,\n\nquase todos estão dependentes de uma decisão maioritária.”66 (Leston-Bandeira, 2001, pág.\n\n151). O governo, antes, podia escolher as perguntas a responder e, apesar de essa regra ter sido\n\nsuprimida, isso ainda acontece na prática. Alguns deputados vão repetindo a mesma pergunta até\n\nser finalmente respondida. Este mecanismo costuma ter muita visibilidade noutros parlamentos, o\n\nque não acontece em Portugal. As interpelações estão presentes na constituição e não mudaram\n\nmuito desde 1976. Contudo, foram perdendo solenidade/formalidade. Hoje em dia, parecem\n\nmuito rígidas (cada GP só tem direito a 2 por ano). As propostas de comissão de inquérito têm\n\n66\n\nTradução livre de “Strong criticism has centered on the questions to the government. These are considered too irregular, too infrequent and too ineffective. What is more, the government may choose the questions it wishes to answer.(…) each group may propose only two interpellations per year – and they do not allow an expeditious answer to topical issues of the day.(…) Although the Portuguese committees of inquiry do enjoy wide powers of investigation, most are dependent on a majority decision.”\n\n76\n\npoder judicial, mas os deputados queixam-se de fornecimento tardio e reduzido de informação.\n\nNão obstante, funcionam em chamar atenção para os assuntos tratados. Mesmo assim, muitos\n\nprocessos acabam por ilibar o governo e a administração pública. O controlo parlamentar\n\ndesenvolveu-se verdadeiramente na segunda década de democracia. Antes disso, era mais solene\n\ne descontínua. “As alterações vieram, por um lado, com a própria prática parlamentar no 2º\n\ndécada democrática, numa altura em que preocupações primárias de assegurar a transição para\n\na democracia tinham sido substituídas por preocupações de eficácia, com o objectivo essencial\n\nde pôr a democracia a funcionar; e, por outro, a própria experiência de duas maiorias absolutas\n\nconsecutivas.” (Leston-Bandeira, 2002, pág. 139). A análise indica que a prática da fiscalização\n\nsó se tornou rotina quando perdeu o seu carácter solene. Durante as maiorias absolutas, os meios\n\nde controlo criados em alternativa surgiram por meio da promoção do debate público e o reforço\n\nda função informativa do parlamento. O poder atribuído às comissões especializadas também\n\nauxiliou. Antes disso, as oportunidades para criticar o governo eram aproveitadas no PAOD 67.\n\nEntretanto, introduziu-se em 1997, o debate de urgência e o debate da actualidade. Por fim, existe\n\no anual Debate do Estado da Nação. Os debates mensais com o PM e as audições públicas das\n\ncomissões especializadas descrevem outras formas de aumentar a transparência e promover a\n\nfiscalização do governo. Alguns GPs também promovem audições públicas a entidades públicas.\n\nFoi criado um site68 onde se passou a poder comentar/criticar o trabalho do governo. Os debates\n\nespeciais passaram a realizar-se com mais frequência e desde António Guterres, tentou fomentar se o hábito do PM ir à AR mensalmente69. Ter audiências públicas também se tornou mais\n\n67\n\nPeríodo antes da Ordem de Trabalhos.\n\n68\n\nEndereço em www.parlamento.pt.\n\n69\n\n77\n\ncomum e ajudou os comités a ganhar peso. Desde 1976, que a AR é constitucionalmente obrigada\n\na ouvir as partes interessadas com a criação de nova legislação (os sindicatos, comités de\n\ntrabalhadores ou as regiões autónomas, por exemplo). No regulamento interno, diz também que\n\nterá de consultar os governos locais quando apropriado. A AR passou a ter mais acesso a\n\ninformação aquando da consideração de nova legislação (1993) e a VIIª Legislatura inclui nos\n\nrelatórios anuais muito do trabalho complementar, como debates fora da assembleia e seminários\n\npor ela organizados. “Estas actividades têm envolvido grupos de interesse, especialistas e\n\ncidadãos comuns” (Leston-Bandeira, 2002, pág. 145).\n\nA função de escrutínio ganhou muito mais seriedade à medida que a AR desenvolveu a sua\n\nactividade. No entanto, repare-se no pouco espaço (apesar de crescente) que se dá à opinião\n\npública nestes instrumentos. Qualquer controlo feito ao governo provém sempre dos grupos\n\nparlamentares. O público interfere pouco nesta tarefa. Mas existem outras formas de o eleitorado\n\nparticipar no trabalho parlamentar. Nos anos 90, houve uma preocupação explícita em melhorar o\n\nsistema de petições. O que se iniciou como uma prática muito inconsequente ganhou peso, bem\n\ncomo aumentou a participação por parte do público. As principais críticas às petições são a sua\n\nineficácia, ou seja, que frequentemente não dão resposta ao problema posto, o longo tempo entre\n\na sua apresentação e a apreciação no parlamento e o facto de serem maioritariamente utilizadas\n\npor grupos de interesse do que por cidadãos comuns. Desde 1995, as petições têm tido menos\n\nvisibilidade e a comissão de petições foi eliminada. Além de todas as coisas enunciadas\n\nanteriormente, também foram instituídos (1993) intervalos de tempo para cada deputado poder\n\nintervir em nome dos seus círculos eleitorais, bem como se criou uma provisão de tempo no\n\ntrabalho parlamentar e um gabinete para os contactos entre deputados e cidadãos. A cada duas\n\nNo entanto, em abono da verdade, na prática, os debates mensais só aconteceram duas vezes nos primeiros anos do seu mandato.\n\n78\n\nsemanas, os deputados poderiam reunir-se com cidadãos nos respectivos governos civis. Estes\n\núltimos não tiveram muito êxito.\n\nII. Os Partidos e a Representação\n\nPara compreender o funcionamento do parlamento num contexto de participação política, é\n\nnecessário conhecer o papel dos partidos no sistema. Um dos aspectos-chave desta emergência de\n\nnovas atitudes prende-se com os partidos e a forma como monopolizam a representação nas\n\ndemocracias estabelecidas ocidentais. Os partidos tornaram-se a principal via de comunicação\n\nentre a sociedade civil e o poder político. Nas últimas décadas, contudo, tem-se observado um\n\ncerto desencantamento do eleitorado face aos mesmos nestas sociedades. A ideologia diluiu-se e\n\nmuitos dos partidos tornaram-se catch-all, premiando a quantidade de seguidores acima da\n\nqualidade dos seus princípios. Como consequência, o apoio partidário é cada vez mais difuso.\n\nMuitos cidadãos continuam a ser simpatizantes, mas já não se tornam militantes dos partidos.\n\nDesenvolveu-se uma ideia no senso comum de que os membros dos partidos (onde se incluem os\n\ndeputados da AR), cada vez mais, são provenientes de uma elite que se prova cada vez mais\n\nafastada da realidade e dos problemas do seu eleitorado. A investigadora Ana Maria Belchior tem\n\ntrês artigos-chave que interligam a qualidade de representação do eleitorado por parte dos\n\npartidos com o pós-materialismo e como os partidos portugueses se encaixam na teoria da\n\nmodernização cultural. É a autora cuja investigação do contexto português está mais próxima do\n\ntema desta tese. É uma importante adição no estudo dos partidos que se designam habitualmente\n\nde Nova Esquerda (na mesma linha da Nova Política advogada por Dalton). Os seus valores\n\nparecem coadunar-se mais com os pós-materialistas, o que não significa necessariamente melhor\n\nrepresentação dos seus interesses.\n\n79\n\nBelchior (2010) faz uma análise aos partidos políticos europeus e ao seu grau de aproximação\n\nao eleitorado. Presta especial atenção ao surgimento dos novos partidos com características pós materialistas (mais concretamente, os Verdes). Sugere que estes podem ser mais adeptos da\n\ndemocracia e que podem constituir representações mais próximas dos seus eleitores que os outros\n\npartidos na cena política.\n\nEm primeiro lugar, Belchior dá conta das mudanças a acontecer na sociedade e da Teoria de\n\nModernização Cultural que as tenta explicar. O grau de representação é medido pela congruência\n\nMP-eleitor. A teoria fala de um novo modelo de “fazer política”, praticado pela “nova esquerda”.\n\nEstes partidos caracterizam-se por: “uma democracia pluralista, participativa, libertária e até\n\nanti-capitalista, (...) preocupada com assuntos ecológicos, feministas e relativos à paz, bem\n\ncomo, problemas políticos colectivos em geral. (…) fidelidade ideológica fraca, liderança\n\npartidária frágil e lealdade incipiente por parte dos militantes.”70 (Belchior, 2010, pág. 3/4). Os\n\nseus eleitores estão entre os mais jovens, mais educados e provenientes da classe média. Os\n\npaíses contemplados são: a Bélgica, a França, Alemanha e Luxemburgo. Na análise aos partidos\n\ndestes países, quase todos têm algumas características pós-materialistas, mas são os deputados\n\nverdes que têm mais probabilidade de as apresentarem (à esquerda, mais jovens e com educação\n\nsuperior). A Alemanha era o país, à data, com mais deputados verdes. No passo seguinte,\n\nBelchior mede a satisfação com a democracia nos países e verifica uma relação significativa entre\n\ndescontentamento com a democracia e os partidos verdes (excepto os alemães, devido à partilha\n\nde poder no sistema alemão). Ela existe também entre eleitores desses partidos, apesar de mais\n\nténue.\n\n70\n\nTradução livre de “pluralist, participative, libertarian and even anti-capitalist democracy, (…) concerned with ecological, feminist and peace matters, as well as collective political issues in general.(...)feeble ideological anchorage, fragile party leadership and incipient partisan loyalties...”\n\n80\n\nA medida de congruência compreende o centrismo (medida de representação dos deputados\n\nrelativamente às preferências políticas médias dos eleitores e a diferença entre o posicionamento\n\nmédio entre MPs e eleitores (como proxy da ideologia). O que se observa neste estudo é que as\n\nposições dos partidos costumam ser mais à esquerda do que o eleitorado, incluindo os verdes.\n\nEstes últimos não parecem ser os mais congruentes, nem favorecer as posições dos seus eleitores.\n\nLuxemburgo e Alemanha têm as congruências mais elevadas, que, mesmo assim, são moderadas.\n\nBelchior justifica estes resultados com lealdade difusa aos partidos e uma base ideológica fraca.\n\n“Apesar de se ter demonstrado que os Verdes representam os pós-materialistas melhor, isto não\n\nparece ter uma relação significativa com terem um melhor desempenho na congruência\n\nideológica.”71 (Belchior, 2010, pág. 18). Alguns deputados verdes são críticos da democracia,\n\nmas isso não se reflecte numa melhor representação do eleitorado. Na verdade, partidos verdes\n\nnão mostram níveis mais elevados de congruência e não parece haver ligação entre o pós materialismo e maior congruência em geral, “Parece haver uma lacuna entre crenças idealistas e\n\npolítica pragmática.”72 (Belchior, 2010, pág.21). A congruência parece depender mais da\n\nideologia do próprio deputado do que das suas características pós-materialistas (mas mais estudo\n\né recomendado). Contudo, há que ter em conta que a análise foi feita qualitativamente, a partir\n\ndos manifestos dos partidos, pelo que há uma grande dependência da interpretação que é dada ao\n\ntexto. Adicionalmente, a fidelidade ao partido entre pós-materialistas não costuma ser muito\n\nforte, pelo que o apoio formal que recolhem (o registado) pode estar longe do efectivo, que é mais\n\ndifuso. Outro pormenor a ter em conta é que os partidos verdes europeus são muito diferentes\n\n71\n\nTradução livre de “Although it has been shown that the Greens represent post-materialists better, this does not appear to be significantly related to their performing better on ideological congruence”\n\n72\n\nTradução livre de “There seems to be a gap between idealistic beliefs and pragmatic politics”\n\n81\n\nentre si e, por isso, torna-se difícil fazer uma comparação que não suprima aspectos importantes\n\ncaracterísticos de cada contexto.\n\nO seu segundo artigo Party Political Representation in Portugal (2008) destina-se a analisar\n\no grau de congruência (political congruence) entre as visões políticas dos candidatos e dos\n\neleitores portugueses, em termos de posição ideológica e atitudes para com a democracia. As duas\n\nhipóteses avançadas são a da ideologia - os deputados parecem ter uma ideologia mais radical que\n\no eleitor médio – e das atitudes - as elites são mais favoráveis à democracia que o eleitorado. O\n\nmodelo delegate de representação é verosímil em teoria, mas não acontece na prática, sendo\n\nencarado actualmente como utópico. O estilo representative73 é considerado mais próximo do que\n\nocorre hoje em dia. No entanto, a nível normativo, pensa-se sempre que o representante deve\n\ndefender os interesses do povo (quer este último os conheça ou não). “Como actores\n\nfundamentais no processo democrático, os partidos políticos são os canais-chave formais que\n\nligam a vontade do povo à sua representação no parlamento.”74 (Belchior, 2008, pág. 459).\n\nBelchior faz uma análise empírica entre a posição ideológica média da elite partidária/programa\n\npartidário e eleitores. Utiliza parâmetros de Aschen (1978): proximidade, centrismo e capacidade\n\nde resposta (responsiveness). Nos resultados que já existem, a congruência geral entre partidos e\n\neleitores verifica-se mais em assuntos socio-económicos e morais, enquanto é menor em termos\n\nde política externa e muito fraca no que toca a ajuda externa e leis. Isto traduz-se numa maior\n\nproximidade em termos de ideologia, mas não em temas práticos, menos politizados. Na análise\n\n73\n\nNo delegate model, o deputado age como um simples delegado, obedecendo às vontades literais dos eleitores do seu distrito eleitoral. A este, costuma opor-se o representative model que vê o deputado mais como um representante, que, uma vez eleito, tem a confiança dos eleitores para tomar as suas próprias decisões, tendo em conta o bem comum.\n\n74\n\nTradução livre de “As fundamental actores in the democratic process, political parties are the key formal channel connecting the will of the people to its representation in parliament.”\n\n82\n\ndo contexto português, os deputados parecem estar mais à esquerda do que o seu eleitorado,\n\nexceptuando o CDS-PP, em que acontece o oposto. A CDU aparece como a mais distante dos\n\nseus eleitores, o que se confirma na realidade de outros países. Nas outras medidas, a\n\nproximidade é maior no PS. O que se tira é que a elite política reflecte as divisões no eleitorado\n\nem termos de ideologia, mesmo que a primeira se mostre um pouco mais radical que o segundo.\n\nDepois, estabeleceu-se uma comparação de ideologias entre o auto-posicionamento dos\n\ndeputados e as suas percepções quanto à posição ideológica do partido e dos eleitores. O\n\nresultado foi, nos cinco partidos, os deputados posicionaram todas estas visões muito próximas\n\numas das outras. No entanto, a realidade é diferente. Os deputados prevêem algum enviesamento\n\nà direita para o partido e o eleitorado, mas a distância é maior do que pensam: “de uma\n\nperspectiva ideológica, a elite pressupõe que existe uma quase-congruência. As minhas análises\n\nrevelam que não. (…) Esta mesma diferença de percepção foi encontrada em todos os 15\n\nEstados-Membros.”75 (Belchior, 2008, pág. 468). Como potenciais causas alternativas,\n\napresentam-se a maior heterogeneidade entre eleitores ou uma falha na percepção dos votantes\n\nquanto à ideologia do seu partido. “Com a excepção do PS e, em menor grau, do CDS/PP, há\n\numa discrepância substancial entre o posicionamento dos partidos na percepção dos deputados e\n\ndo eleitorado.”76 (Belchior, 2008, pág. 468). Porém, o que se observa é que, com excepção do\n\nPSD, o eleitorado tende a estimar correctamente as posições do partido. O público parece\n\nperceber as discrepâncias entre estas e as suas próprias posições relativas mais eficazmente que os\n\ndeputados. No que toca às atitudes perante a democracia, usou-se como medida o grau de\n\n75\n\nTradução livre de “(...) from an ideological perspective, the elite presupposes that a near-congruence exists. My findings reveal that it does not.(...) This same misperception has been found in all the 15 EU Member-states.”\n\n76\n\nTradução livre de “With the exception of the PS and, to a lesser degree, the CDS/PP, there is a substantial discrepancy between the positioning of parties as perceived by their MPs and by their electorate.”\n\n83\n\nconcordância com três citações. Nesta situação, regista-se uma abordagem mais negativa do\n\neleitorado do que da elite. Outro aspecto curioso é que apenas cerca de 1% dos deputados, contra\n\n14% de cidadãos discorda que a democracia será o melhor sistema político disponível. Há mais\n\nsemelhança das opiniões entre cidadãos e entre deputados, do que uma ligação de cidadãos com\n\ndeputados do mesmo partido. Isto significa que a opinião será mais influenciada pela condição de\n\nse ser deputado ou cidadão do que necessariamente se pertencer a um dado partido. Se\n\nconsiderarmos o posicionamento no espectro político, no eleitorado a relação não é significativa,\n\nmas, entre deputados, a esquerda mostra-se mais favorável à democracia.\n\nConcluindo, há muita variância a nível de congruência à esquerda. O PS aparece como o mais\n\ncongruente, opondo-se à CDU que é o menos. O eleitorado tem opiniões mais semelhantes entre\n\nsi (mais centrista) do que entre a elite parlamentar, o que pode ser justificado por uma menor\n\nsofisticação política da opinião pública. Além disso, têm uma melhor percepção das posições dos\n\nseus representantes e partidos do que, ao contrário, acontece com os deputados. Estas\n\ncaracterísticas são partilhadas com a generalidade dos outros países europeus. Há mais\n\ncongruência em termos de atitudes perante a democracia do que perante ideologia. Por outro lado,\n\nhá mais homogeneidade em ideologia entre o eleitorado do que entre deputados. Alguma\n\ndivergência entre MPs e eleitores é esperada. Todavia, há que ter atenção para que a distância não\n\naumente, enfraquecendo os partidos. Belchior verifica que, em Portugal, a congruência é razoável\n\ne em linha com a Europa, mesmo que advertindo ainda para a falta de dados, o tamanho reduzido\n\ndas amostras e a necessidade de ser conservador a tirar grandes conclusões dos resultados.\n\nFinalmente, no seu terceiro artigo Democracia nos Partidos Políticos Portugueses (2008),\n\nBelchior faz uma análise ao perfil do eleitorado português, numa tentativa de ver se a base social\n\nestá próxima ou não da esquerda libertária. Igualmente, estuda o programa político dos partidos\n\nportugueses e a sua organização/estilo partidário (funcionamento interno nos estatutos), para ver a\n\nproximidade com princípios e procedimentos democráticos. A sofisticação do público é crescente\n\n84\n\ne, consequentemente as suas exigências à elite política. Na caracterização do eleitorado dos\n\npartidos, o BE destaca-se como tendo a maior fatia relativa de eleitorado com características pós materialistas, ou seja, jovem, educado e urbano, que trabalha na administração pública, com\n\nrendimentos típicos de classe média. Um pormenor interessante é que mais de 70% diz-se apenas\n\nsimpatizante e não militante do partido. Surpreendentemente, o BE não apresenta um programa\n\npós-materialista. O CDS-PP suplanta-o em termos de características libertárias. O PEV revela-se\n\no mais libertário de todos, advogando o “governo pelo povo”. Nos estatutos, o PCP destaca-se\n\ncomo o mais paradoxal, com um “conservadorismo da revolução”. O PSD e o PS convidam mais\n\nà participação política (eleição directa do líder do partido). No entanto, em geral, a influência dos\n\nmilitantes nas listas, dentro do partido, é difícil (CDS e PCP são os mais top-down e PSD, o mais\n\ndescentralizado). As análises de Belchior permitem afirmar que, no sistema partidário português,\n\nhá maior congruência entre o eleitorado e um partido da esquerda tradicional, em oposição a um\n\nda nova esquerda, que se teorizava. Em Portugal, ser de um partido ecologista ou de nova\n\nesquerda, com um eleitorado pós-materialista não se traduz necessariamente num\n\naprofundamento democrático. Belchior conclui que a hipótese da teoria da modernização cultural\n\nnão se verifica no caso português. Todavia, esta última conclusão pode ser um pouco precipitada.\n\nAs conclusões foram baseadas em análises qualitativas, pelo estudo dos programas e dos\n\nestatutos. Existe sempre uma diferença entre os que os partidos dizem e o que fazem na prática.\n\nAo mesmo tempo, não parecem haver verdadeiras alternativas pós-materialistas neste cenário. O\n\nBE é um partido com muitos dissidentes do PCP e o PEV partilha com este o seu grupo\n\nparlamentar, pelo que está muito dependente. As principais opções para o eleitorado pós materialista português são, portanto, dois partidos que emanam de alguma forma do PCP. Dizer\n\nque são alternativas verdadeiras a novos fenómenos e novas formas de fazer política seria algo\n\nredutor. Para mais, o facto de não haver ainda partidos de cariz pós-materialista não significa que\n\no eleitorado não esteja a sofrer essa transformação e não queira tais partidos. Apenas significa que\n\nesses ainda não foram criados. Mais recentemente, por ocasião das eleições europeias, surgiram o\n\n85\n\nMovimento 3D e o Partido Livre. Esses parecem ter mais potencial dentro da teoria da\n\nmodernização cultural, mas mais estudo na matéria seria aconselhável.\n\nIII. Os eleitores portugueses\n\nA percepção que se tem na vida quotidiana é de descontentamento geral com o\n\ndesempenho da classe política, mas o Parlamento português passa, agora, mais leis que alguma\n\nvez passou e abriu-se ao público mais que alguma vez antes registada. Continua, apesar disso, a\n\nusufruir de menos recursos que o nível europeu. Resta saber se a incongruência vem de uma\n\nopinião pública portuguesa mal informada ou com o cepticismo e exigência crescentes típicos das\n\nsociedades advogadas por Dalton.\n\nUma quebra no apoio específico parece traduzir uma insatisfação conjuntural. Uma quebra\n\nno apoio difuso77 significa problemas estruturais ou uma alteração nos valores fundamentais na\n\nsociedade. “Mudança e variações nos valores e tradições dominantes ou nos padrões de\n\ninteracção e socialização política reflectir-se-ão inevitavelmente no grau de apoio difuso\n\nconcedido às instituições democráticas. Assim, para autores como Putnam, as democracias\n\nocidentais atravessam hoje uma fase de diminuição de confiança nas instituições e nos agentes\n\npolíticos, atribuível, em parte, à erosão dos laços familiares e comunitários, ao papel dos meios\n\nde comunicação social (especialmente da televisão) na ocupação dos tempos livres e na\n\nsocialização política e à crescente mobilidade social.78 Já para Inglehart, o desenvolvimento\n\n77\n\nApoio específico é o grau de satisfação com o desempenho das instituições políticas e apoio difuso é o valor\n\nintrínseco que lhe é atribuído pelos cidadãos.\n\n78\n\nPutnam 1995; Brehm e Rahn 1998; Pharr, Putnam e Dalton 2000\n\n86\n\neconómico e a expansão do ensino das últimas décadas terão contribuído para uma mutação nos\n\nvalores sociais no sentido daquilo que designou por 'pós-materialismo', implicando um crescente\n\nquestionamento das tradicionais fontes de autoridade, entre as quais as próprias instituições\n\ngovernativas.” (Freire, 2002, pág. 136). Outras razões apontadas para oscilações/quebras no\n\napoio difuso são o carácter recente da democracia, ou a adesão dos cidadãos em função d'”a\n\nforma como distribuem poder, facilitam a responsabilização política e a introdução de interesses\n\ne exigências no sistema político.” (Freire, 2002, pág. 136). Com dados do painel Expresso Euroexpansão, entre 1986 e 2000, o autor dá conta de uma opinião sobre a AR “globalmente\n\npositiva, embora sem entusiasmos”. A possível causa será o facto de ser um órgão colectivo e não\n\npersonalizado, o que dificulta a criação de laços afectivos e a atribuição clara de\n\nresponsabilidades. Outras apontadas serão o distanciamento dos cidadãos, a pouca visibilidade da\n\nAR e a pouca autonomia percepcionada face ao governo. Nos dados, a popularidade da AR,\n\napesar de menos sujeita a flutuações, parece acompanhar a do governo. Em 1993, procedeu-se a\n\numa reforma parlamentar com o intuito de aproximar a AR dos eleitores. No entanto, esta parece\n\nnão ter tido um impacto significativo no apoio dado à instituição, uma vez que medidas concretas\n\nde apoio à AR foram poucas. Freire, num outro estudo79, conclui que “a confiança na AR\n\naumenta consoante a idade, a escolaridade, a religiosidade, a classe social e entre os indivíduos\n\nque indicam uma preferência pelos partidos do centro.” (Freire, 2002, pág. 144).\n\nCom a ajuda de dados do Eurobarómetro (1997, 1999, 2000), Freire (2002) extrai o saldo\n\nde confiança no parlamento, ou seja, a diferença entre os entrevistados que “tendem a confiar” na\n\nAR e os que “tendem a não confiar”. Regista-se uma grande volatilidade ao longo dos países nos\n\n3 anos estudados. Em Portugal, o saldo de 4%, em 1997, evoluiu para -10%, em 2000. A\n\n79\n\nFreire, André (2001). “Religião e política em Portugal, na Irlanda e na Noruega”, in José Machado Pais Manuel Villaverde Cabral e Jorge Vala, Religião e Bioética. Atitudes sociais dos Portugueses 2, Lisboa, ICS\n\n87\n\nconfiança parece depender da conjuntura. Isto é conjugado com o posicionamento no espectro\n\npolítico, o interesse na política, variáveis socioeconómicas, macroeconómicas e político institucionais numa regressão. Daqui, tiraram-se cinco principais conclusões. A primeira é que os\n\nindivíduos mais interessados em temas políticos depositam menor confiança no Parlamento: “em\n\nPortugal, o apoio difuso à instituição parlamentar depende muito menos de posicionamentos\n\npolítico-ideológicos duradouros do que da percepção de benefícios políticos conjunturais.”\n\n(Freire, 2002, pág. 152). Depois, em Portugal, a variável que mais explica a confiança é a\n\nintenção de votar ou não no partido no poder, o que dá uma percepção de benefício neste último\n\ncaso. Em terceiro, o grupo das variáveis macro tem maior peso. As diferenças entre países são\n\nmais marcadas do que intra-países e o desemprego tem impacto na confiança no parlamento. O\n\ngrau de desproporcionalidade no sistema eleitoral também parece influenciar negativamente. A\n\ndescentralização tem um papel positivo pequeno, mas efectivo. Em quarto lugar, “Os resultados\n\npermitem-nos concluir que a personalização das candidaturas e do voto proporcionada pelo\n\nsistema eleitoral é, a par com a performance económica de cada país (medida pela taxa de\n\ndesemprego), a variável mais importante para explicar os níveis de confiança no parlamento.”\n\n(Freire, 2002, pág. 153). A sua relação é negativa. Por último, os portugueses parecem confundir\n\nconfiança no parlamento com confiança no sistema político ou desempenho do governo.\n\nO autor tem um outro ensaio, Issue Voting in Portugal: The 2002 Legislative Elections\n\n(2004), o qual elucida sobre o comportamento dos eleitores portugueses, através da análise da\n\nimportância relativa de certos temas comparada com outros elementos do comportamento\n\neleitoral. Nessas legislativas de 2002, ganhou o PSD com 40.2% dos votos. Seguindo-o, o PS\n\n(37.8%), o CDS/PP (8.7%), a CDU (6.9%) e, por último, o BE (2.7%). A campanha foi marcada\n\npor uma pobre partilha de ideias (de todos), reservando-se a um apelo aos votos. Os temas mais\n\nfrequentes na campanha foram o futebol, a mercado laboral, a economia e as finanças do Estado.\n\nOutros assuntos mais residuais foram imigração, a liberalização do aborto e a protecção\n\n88\n\nambiental. Artigos anteriores do mesmo autor concluíram que o padrão de voto não tem uma\n\ninfluência significativa da posição dos partidos face a assuntos ditos fracturantes, nem do\n\nposicionamento esquerda/direita dos eleitores. Os mesmos também registaram uma tradição fraca\n\nde militância entre os cidadãos portugueses. “Portugal é um estudo de caso crucial para o\n\ncomportamento eleitoral: dada a militância muito pouco apoiada em vínculos sociais, espera-se\n\nque o seu impacto de determinantes de curto-prazo, tal como os assuntos ou os candidatos,\n\nsejam consideráveis.”80 (Freire, 2004, pág. 782). Os eleitores parecem tomar a sua decisão de\n\nvoto, baseando-se na aproximação da ideologia dos partidos ao seu posicionamento no espectro\n\npolítico, no programa dos partidos e na hierarquização que fazem dos assuntos que lhe\n\ninteressam. Estes assuntos podem ser considerados consensuais (quando toda a gente concorda\n\nserem importantes, mas apenas discordam da ordem com que devem ser tratados) e os\n\nfracturantes (assuntos que, pela posição que se toma, definem a nossa ideologia). Além destas\n\napreciações, os eleitores também avaliam a performance passada destes partidos. Dados vários\n\nassuntos, a análise faz-se mediante duas dicotomias: o egocentrismo vs. sociotropismo e\n\nretrospectiva vs. prospectiva. Na regressão linear, os assuntos económicos parecem ter maior\n\npeso, seguidos da segurança social. Na regressão bivariada, a relação entre a hierarquização dos\n\nassuntos e o voto não mostra-se não linear. Na análise multivariada, as variáveis mais influentes\n\nsão a avaliação dos candidatos e, depois, o posicionamento político do próprio eleitor. As\n\navaliações retrospectivas quanto ao desempenho na economia vêm em terceiro lugar. Os assuntos\n\nfracturantes têm mais impacto nas pontas do espectro político, o que, segundo Freire, podem\n\ndenotar um menor impacto da ideologia na política portuguesa. Os partidos catch-all (PS e PSD)\n\nsão os que denotam menos fidelidade militante e o PCP está no outro extremo. Este ensaio\n\ntransmite que assuntos fracturantes não têm impacto significativo no voto, no entanto o autor\n\n80\n\nTradução livre de “Portugal is a crucial test case for issue voting: due to the very weak social anchoring of partisanship, it is expected that the impact of short-term effects on the vote, such as issues and candidates, is\n\n89\n\nadverte para o modelo de voto poder precisar de mais especificação relativamente a políticas\n\ncontroversas. Segundo, os partidos não foram claros nas suas propostas programáticas e essa\n\nlacuna pesa mais do que a educação ou sofisticação política do eleitor. No acto do voto, as\n\nvariáveis com mais peso são, por ordem, a apreciação dos candidatos, o posicionamento político\n\ndo eleitor e, em geral, a economia. As ligações ideológicas e sociais do eleitorado com os partidos\n\nmostram-se muito ténues.\n\nIV. Confiança no Parlamento\n\nA confiança dos cidadãos nas suas instituições é uma peça tão importante na política de um\n\npaís quanto fugidia. É algo extremamente subjectivo, que se alicerça em crenças e condições\n\npessoais, mais do que em desempenho propriamente dito e muito difícil de se quantificar. No\n\ncaso das instituições legislativas, esta dificuldade também se aplica. As recolhas de opinião\n\npública que abordam esta problemática costumam questionar ao cidadão qual o seu nível de\n\nconfiança face ao seu parlamento, dentro de uma escala com mais ou menos segmentos, no\n\nentanto esta será sempre uma classificação abstracta. Como se classifica a confiança? Alguns\n\nacadémicos tentaram criar metodologias que ofereçam mais informação e que possibilitem saber\n\nmais sobre o que contribui para estas percepções dos eleitores. Thomas van der Meer foi um\n\ndeles, tendo ido um pouco mais longe, ao analisar a confiança subjacente na relação cidadão Parlamento, confrontando a percepção do sujeito (o cidadão/ eleitor) com a do objecto (o\n\nParlamento)81, numa perspectiva mais holística. “Confiança no sistema político é crucial para\n\ngarantir a legitimidade do sistema: a confiança política funciona como a cola que mantém o\n\n81\n\nOs dados são tirados do European Social Study.\n\n90\n\nsistema unido e como o óleo que lubrifica a máquina política.”82 (van der Meer, 2010, pág. 518).\n\nEm acréscimo, a análise foi efectuada a três níveis: o do indivíduo (nível 1), as tendências dentro\n\nde um país ao longo do tempo (nível 2) e o país comparado com outros (nível 3). Para atestar\n\nestas relações todas, gera regressões multivariadas e testa várias hipóteses. Segundo ele, este nível\n\nde confiança pode revestir-se de quatro dimensões: a competência, o cuidado intrínseco, a\n\nresponsabilidade83 e a fiabilidade. Explicando cada uma delas, em primeiro lugar, a competência\n\nimplica a crença do sujeito de que o objecto tem capacidade para desempenhar a tarefa que lhe é\n\natribuída ou defender os interesses do sujeito (o output da política é bem-sucedido a nível social,\n\neconómico e político. Segundo, o compromisso intrínseco (ou o cuidado com…) implica a crença\n\ndo sujeito de que o objecto irá agir segundo os interesses do primeiro por duas razões: ou existe\n\npreocupação mútua e partilha de objectivos (care), ou o sujeito tem alguma forma de sancionar o\n\nobjecto, mesmo que seja só por retirada de confiança. Em terceiro lugar, a responsabilidade\n\nilustra a possibilidade de o objecto pode ser coagido a prestar satisfações ou justificar as suas\n\nacções ao sujeito, que acaba por ter no seu próprio interesse a defesa dos interesses do sujeito.\n\nTraduz, em última análise, a capacidade dos eleitores de tirar do poder figuras que não estão a ter\n\num bom desempenho. Em quarto lugar, a previsibilidade/fiabilidade relaciona-se com a\n\nconsistência e estabilidade passada do comportamento do objecto, em que o sistema mostra-se\n\nbem estabelecido e os mandatos são levados até ao fim.\n\nO modelo de regressão mostra que as diferenças em confiança provêm mais do nível 1 (84%),\n\n“Diferenças [de confiança no parlamento] entre cidadãos importam mais do que aquelas entre\n\n82\n\nTradução livre de “Trust in the political system is crucial to warrant the legitimacy of the system: political trust functions as the glue that keeps the system together and as the oil that lubricates the policy machine.”\n\n83\n\nUsa-se a palavra “responsabilidade” à falta de melhor termo para descrever o que em inglês se chama de accountability.\n\n91\n\nanos e países.”84 (van der Meer, 2010, pág. 525). A seguir, vêm 15% de diferenças de nível 3 e\n\napenas 2% explicadas ao nível 285. Dentro das suas principais descobertas, as diferenças de nível\n\n3, inter-países, mostram que a confiança política tende a ser mais elevada nos países escandinavos\n\ne Holanda e muito baixa nos países da Europa Central e de Leste. Estas diferenças são marcadas\n\npela corrupção, isto é, a confiança mostra tendência a diminuir com a percepção de corrupção\n\ngeneralizada; pelo sistema eleitoral, onde sistemas proporcionais tomam a dianteira ao inspirarem\n\nmais confiança que os maioritários, bem como o regime anterior, em que países que tiveram\n\nregimes autoritários ou totalitários86 tendem a resistir a confiar nas suas instituições. A corrupção\n\ndetém um papel central neste assunto. Podemos dizer que é a antítese da confiança para as\n\ninstituições públicas. É possível estabelecer aspectos negativos simétricos aos enunciados\n\nanteriormente como dimensões da confiança. A corrupção generalizada prejudica a eficácia e a\n\neficiência da actividade parlamentar (o contrário da competência). Ser-se corrupto implica a\n\nausência de escrúpulos, mostrando falta de cuidado para com os eleitores, pelo que não merecerá\n\nconfiança a longo-prazo (simétrico à relação de preocupação e cuidado com os eleitores). A\n\ncorrupção alastra-se pela falta de meios de os eleitores sancionarem os seus deputados (motivada\n\nfalta de responsabilidade - accountability). Por fim, as sociedades corruptas não são fiáveis, pois\n\nos resultados das políticas não são previsíveis (que é o contrário do desejado no que respeita ao\n\n84\n\nTradução livre de “Differences between citizens matter more than those between years and countries.”\n\n85\n\nNo entanto, o autor explica que seria aconselhável a utilização de mais anos, caso estivessem disponíveis. A evolução deste tipo de tendências estende-se por gerações e só será visível com um intervalo de tempo de algumas décadas.\n\n86\n\nNo seu estudo, van der Meer dá especial atenção aos regimes ex-comunistas. As análises à confiança no parlamento, dada uma herança de regime autoritário/totalitário são baseadas maioritariamente em contextos deste tipo.\n\n92\n\naspecto da previsibilidade). Outra conclusão interessante prende-se com a fragmentação do\n\nparlamento. A hipótese testada não se confirma, pelo que denota que uma assembleia que tenha\n\ndificuldades em chegar a consensos, que seja quebrada por divisões partidárias não é sinónimo de\n\npior desempenho das suas funções, segundo a percepção dos eleitores. Surpreendentemente, o\n\ndesenvolvimento económico do país parece não ter influência significativa sobre a confiança no\n\nparlamento. Apenas a situação económica pessoal parece poder afectá-la ligeiramente. Van der\n\nMeer testou também o crescimento económico, uma evolução da economia numa perspectiva\n\nmais puramente quantitativa (em oposição ao desenvolvimento económico) e descobriu que, da\n\nmesma forma, o crescimento geral não tem impacto significativo sobre a confiança, mas que\n\nexiste um efeito ao nível individual que, estranhamente, é de maior rendimento no lar contribuir\n\npara menos confiança no parlamento. No nível 2, a evolução da confiança parece manter-se\n\nestável dentro dos países, quando analisada ao longo do tempo. Portugal teve uma média de\n\n22.4% entre 2002 e 200687, o que é considerado um valor relativamente baixo. Em comparação, a\n\nDinamarca tem uma média de 64.3% das três vagas e a Polónia, no limite inferior, tem 10%. No\n\nmodelo referente ao nível 1, van der Meer encontrou que, entre os mais educados dentro do\n\nmesmo país, o grau de confiança prende-se mais com o desempenho propriamente dito da\n\ninstituição do que de um sentimento subjectivo, misturado com crenças pessoais; “Isto implica\n\nque os mais educados são afectados por critérios externos e objectivos de desempenho,\n\ncompromisso e fiabilidade mais do que os menos educados.”88 (van der Meer, 2010, pág. 531).\n\nDe todas as conclusões, a mais interessante será a constatação de que, para os eleitores, parece\n\n87\n\nPercentagem de entrevistados que atribuíram entre 6 e 10 numa pontuação de 0 (nenhuma confiança) a 10 (toda a confiança) no seu parlamento.\n\n88\n\nTradução livre de “This implies that the higher educated are affected by objective, external criteria of performance, commitment, and reliability more than the lower educated.”\n\n93\n\nmostrar-se mais importante a emoção que a mestria, ou seja, “Os desenhos institucionais que\n\nenfatizam o cuidado e a integridade parecem ser mais benéficos do que os que enfatizam a\n\ncompetência e o desempenho.”89 (van de Meer, 2010, pág. 518); e ainda “relações de\n\ncuidado/afecto podem ser mais importantes para a confiança no parlamento do que a\n\nresponsabilidade”90 (van der Meer, 2010, pág. 530/1). No caso de Portugal, Leston-Bandeira\n\nresume muito bem o estado em que se encontram as relações cidadãos-parlamento: “Um período\n\nde 155 anos de experiência de mandatos corruptos deixou, não só um sentido de desconfiança\n\nnos representantes, mas também negou a oportunidade de nutrir uma cultura mais cívica de\n\nenvolvimento público na política parlamentar.”91 (Leston-Bandeira, 2012b, pág. 386). Além\n\ndisso, as instituições que, por altura da transição se preocupavam com representatividade e\n\nlegitimidade, passam a ter que responder às crescentes exigências da opinião pública em serem\n\nmais eficazes e estáveis.\n\nNoutro artigo de 2012, Leston-Bandeira dá conta das tentativas dos parlamentos pelo mundo\n\npara se aproximarem dos seus eleitorados. Foca a relação cidadão-parlamento na perspectiva da\n\nrepresentação simbólica. As impressões iniciais são: “que o público não valoriza o parlamento.\n\nMas os mesmos estudos também mostram que os parlamentos nunca foram tão activos no\n\ndesenvolvimento de ligações com os cidadãos, nem tão transparentes ou acessíveis. Na verdade,\n\né nos casos em que a confiança no parlamento se mostra mais baixa que há mais actividade,\n\n89\n\nTradução livre de “Institutional designs that emphasize care and integrity appear to be more beneficial than ones that emphasize competence and performance.”\n\n90\n\nTradução livre de “care relationships may be more important to trust in parliament than accountability”.\n\n91\n\nTradução livre de “A period of 155 years’ experience of ill-formed representative mandates left not only a general sense of distrust of representatives, but it also denied the opportunity to nurture a more civic-like culture of public engagement with parliamentary politics.”\n\n94\n\ntransparência e acessibilidade, tal como acontece nas legislaturas britânica e alemã.”92 (Leston Bandeira, 2012a, pág. 514). Existem três níveis de relacionamento público-AR a considerar: o do\n\ndeputado; o do partido (grupo parlamentar) e a legislatura como um todo. Os estudos de caso\n\nmostram que o enquadramento histórico e cultural são determinantes para a escolha dos\n\ncandidatos e as expectativas em relação aos mesmos. Leston-Bandeira apresenta a variedade\n\npresente nos parlamentos dos casos estudados, deixando os mecanismos formais para segundo\n\nplano. Foca-se nas actividades que estão no centro das relações entre os cidadãos e os\n\nparlamentos em concreto, bem como no seu significado. Observa-se uma abertura progressiva\n\ndestas instituições93 por todo o mundo, independentemente do tipo de relação entre o parlamento\n\ne o cidadão. Além da abertura, também a transparência tem obtido maior relevância e as novas\n\ntecnologias têm proporcionado novas plataformas de comunicação94. A comunicação institucional\n\nfoca-se em dar mais visibilidade à legislatura. Ajuda a informar o público sobre a AR e aproximar\n\nas duas partes sem, todavia, dar um cunho político muito óbvio para que seja uma visão\n\nimparcial. Mais acessíveis, transparentes e visíveis, os parlamentos do novo milénio tornaram-se\n\ninstituições verdadeiramente públicas. No entanto, ainda existe uma diferença muito grande entre\n\nos países de alto rendimento e os de baixo e, em países que saíram há relativamente pouco tempo\n\nde regimes autoritários, estes esforços não se têm traduzido numa relação efectiva. Apesar de se\n\nusar os novos média de forma relativamente eficiente para se informar o público, regista-se uma\n\n92\n\nTradução livre de “(…) that the public does not value parliament. And yet the same studies also show that parliaments have never been so active in developing linkages with citizens, or as transparent and accessible. In fact it is those cases where confidence in parliament is at its lowest that there is the most activity, transparency and accessibility, such as the British or the German legislatures.” 93\n\nPara dar um exemplo, na Alemanha, há visitas ao Bündestag com viagem e despesas cobertas.\n\n94\n\nO Parlamento português publica o Diário da República online e já 71% dos deputados do Bündestag usam o Facebook e o Twitter para estabelecer contacto com os eleitores, por exemplo.\n\n95\n\nconexão meramente unilateral, melhor mas ainda irregular. Trata-se mais de informação do que\n\nverdadeira comunicação.\n\nIgualmente, os instrumentos como as petições e a iniciativa legislativa por parte de cidadãos\n\ntêm aumentado (no Reino Unido, o sistema de petições tradicionais tem perdido força, mas tem\n\nsido compensado pelo sistema e-petition e pela introdução destes instrumentos nos parlamentos\n\nregionais escocês e galês). A Alemanha apresenta o caso mais complexo, tendo incluída a petição\n\nna sua Constituição como um direito (ver se nós também) e tendo criado um comité\n\npropositadamente para lidar com este assunto. Mais recentemente, desenvolveu-se um sistema de\n\npetições online que permite recolher assinaturas e gerir fóruns de discussão. Em Portugal, existem\n\npetições online, mas que permitem só o seu registo, não estando ainda equipadas para a sua\n\ndiscussão. Leston-Bandeira encontra um reforço no envolvimento dos eleitores, ligado com a\n\ndisponibilização destas ferramentas (Portugal e Alemanha mostram). No Reino Unido, pelo\n\ncontrário, as petições têm pouca visibilidade e nenhum comité a analisá-las. As análises aos\n\nparlamentos mostram que a percepção da justiça do processo parece importar mais do que o\n\npróprio resultado, que o interesse nas petições parece mover-se num sentido crescente e que, dada\n\na adequada visibilidade e facilidade, os cidadãos usam efectivamente esta ferramenta. “As\n\npetições são a ferramenta parlamentar dirigida ao cidadão que está mais estabelecida. (...) este\n\nvolume [cujo documento presente serve de introdução que abre o periódico The Journal of\n\nLegislative Studies] mostra que as iniciativas legislativas tornaram-se progressivamente\n\npopulares – mas um fenómeno mais contemporâneo.”95 (Leston-Bandeira, 2012a, pág. 519). No\n\nentanto, tem sido mais bem usada na América Latina, persistindo ainda o uso destes mecanismos\n\napenas por partidos e/ou grupos de interesse em vez de por cidadãos em alguns países, como é o\n\ncaso da Itália ou a Hungria, onde, além disto, também os referendos são dominados por grupos\n\n95\n\nTradução livre de “Petitions are the most well-established parliamentary citizen-based tool. (…) this volume shows that citizens’. legislative initiatives have also become increasingly popular – and more of a contemporary phenomenon.”.\n\n96\n\npolíticos. Outro aspecto presente é que as ligações com os eleitores são habitualmente feitas top down, mas que os deputados têm usado as novas ferramentas tecnológicas (site, Facebook e\n\nTwitter são alguns dos exemplos mais conhecidos). A internet permite desenvolver uma relação\n\nmais pessoal e próxima com os eleitores. Estas alterações têm proporcionado algumas melhorias,\n\nmas, ao contrário do que pensavam os mais optimistas, não se deu uma revolução na\n\ncomunicação. Mesmo com esta aproximação relativa, os níveis de confiança no parlamento\n\npermanecem nos mais baixos de sempre e são mais evidentes para com este do que com outras\n\ninstituições políticas. Neste campo, existem alguns estudos que mostram uma situação complexa.\n\nA tendência decrescente não parece ser tão acentuada quanto se pensa. Falando no geral, a\n\nconfiança diminui na Europa, mas aumenta em África e na América Latina. No Reino Unido,\n\nHolanda e Finlândia, a baixa da confiança vem associada a escândalos políticos. Mesmo assim, os\n\nestudos mostram que o nível de confiança continua a ser relativamente mais alto do que noutras\n\ninstituições e que é importante separar entre confiança no parlamento, nos deputados em geral e\n\nnos deputados em particular. Quando existe uma relação mais próxima, o público tende a apreciar\n\nmelhor o seu deputado (do seu distrito). Segundo Norris (1999), “à medida que os cidadãos se\n\ntornam mais informados, também mais educados, mas tornam-se também mais cépticos e\n\ncapazes de criticar”96 (Leston-Bandeira, 2012a, pág. 521). Ilonszki e Papp (2012) concluem que\n\na relação entre confiança e abertura é concêntrica, o que significa que apenas abrir o parlamento\n\nnão será suficiente. Dalton et al. (2003) denuncia que estes novos instrumentos podem ser uma\n\nnova forma de acentuar desigualdades, uma vez que a capacidade necessária para fazer uma\n\npetição é maior do que para votar. Outros ainda falam do facto de a apreciação dada ao\n\nparlamento ser frequentemente a dada ao sistema político, no geral, e não ao seu desempenho, em\n\nespecífico. Muitas vezes, a avaliação do parlamento reflecte o nível de corrupção ou desemprego,\n\n96\n\nTradução livre de “as citizens become more informed, but also better educated, they also become more skeptical and able to criticize”.\n\n97\n\na percepção subjectiva do eleitor do desempenho económico ou do governo. Nas sociedades pós industrializadas, há uma rede mais complexa de interesses muito variados, tornando muito difícil\n\na tarefa do parlamento de agradar a todos, pelo que vão tentando ganhar terreno com estas\n\niniciativas (mais acessibilidade, visibilidade e transparência). Pitkin (1967) é citado com o\n\nseguinte: “O conceito de representação é, pois, uma constante tensão entre cada conquista e o\n\nideal. Deve apresentar um desafio contínuo, mas não sem esperança: o de construir instituições\n\ne de treinar indivíduos de tal forma que eles se envolvam na realização do interesse público; e\n\nque, ao mesmo tempo, permaneçam críticos dessas instituições e desse treino. Para que, assim,\n\nconsigam estar sempre abertos para melhor interpretação e mais reforma.”97 (Leston-Bandeira,\n\n2012a, pág. 522). Leston-Bandeira acrescenta ainda que “está na natureza da instituição\n\nparlamentar permanecer focada nas críticas.”98(Leston-Bandeira, 2012a, pág. 522). Leston Bandeira recorre a Pitkin (1967) para uma classificação da representação dividida em 4\n\ndimensões: a formal, que trata da autoridade que se dá ou que se tem; a descritiva, ou seja, grau\n\nde proximidade entre as características dos representantes e representados; a simbólica, em que\n\ngrau os representantes descrevem os representados mas a nível de símbolos e a substantiva, no\n\nsentido de “acção tomada em nome de...”, trata a representação de interesses particulares. Os\n\nestudos parlamentares têm-se focado mais na forma substantiva (trustee vs. delegate systems) e na\n\ndescritiva (feminismo). A representação formal é contemplada sempre que se discutem\n\nprocedimentos. A perspectiva simbólica é, muitas vezes, ignorada. As duas últimas são as que\n\n97\n\nTradução livre de “The concept of representation thus is a continuing tension between ideal and achievement. Should present a continuing but not hopeless challenge: to construct institutions and train individuals in such a way that they engage in the pursuit of the public interest, the genuine representation of the public; and, at the same time, to remain critical of those institutions and that training. So that they are always open to further interpretation and reform.”\n\n98\n\nTradução livre de “it is in the nature of a parliamentary institution to be the focus of criticism.”\n\n98\n\nmais mudaram com os desenvolvimentos recentes. A representação simbólica apoia-se em\n\naspectos muito subjectivos, “apoia-se no emocional, afectivo e nas respostas psicológicas\n\nirracionais mais do que em critérios justificados racionalmente. (…) Não importa o desempenho\n\ndo parlamento, o que importa é se os cidadãos identificam os símbolos parlamentares de\n\nrepresentação e os significados afectivos que lhes atribuem. (…) a representação não se reduz à\n\nresponsabilidade (accountability); é também feita de ligações irracionais (...) a expansão das\n\nferramentas da democracia representativa, tais como petições também mostram que a\n\nrepresentação não pode ser percepcionada meramente da perspectiva dos representantes a agir\n\nem prol dos interesses dos representados; esses mesmos representados podem agora apresentar\n\npessoalmente os seus interesses ao parlamento. (…) o cidadão da sociedade industrializada\n\ncompreende uma multitude de interesses tão especializada, volátil e complexa que não é possível\n\nser eficaz na representação de todos os cidadãos, a todo o momento, na instituição\n\nparlamentar.”99 (Leston-Bandeira, 2012a, pág. 524). Alguns autores falam de representação\n\ncomo a partilha de uma identidade comum em vez de a mera representação de interesses.\n\nA investigação de Leston-Bandeira (2012b) dá como via preferida de participação, em\n\nPortugal, a petição, que existe nos vários documentos constitucionais desde o primeiro em 1822.\n\nNo entanto, as provisões legais para efectuar uma petição de jure só foram definidas em 1990. A\n\nAR portuguesa é um bom exemplo para analisar como um parlamento pode desenvolver ligações\n\ncom os cidadãos num sistema partidário forte, algo comum nas democracias ocidentais. Os\n\npartidos ainda são o principal intermediário na relação dos cidadãos com a AR, mas começam a\n\n99\n\nTradução livre de “rest on emotional, affective, irrational psychological responses rather than on rationally justifiable criteria.(...) it does not matter how parliament is performing, what matters is whether citizens identify parliamentary symbols of representation and the affective meanings they give to these. (…) representation is not just about accountability; it is also about irrational connections (…) the expansion of advocacy democracy tools such as petitions also demonstrates that parliamentary representation cannot be perceived merely from the perspective of representatives acting for the interests of represented; those same represented can now also present their own interests directly to parliament. (...) the citizen of the advanced industrial society encompasses such a specialised, volatile and complex multitude of interests that it is effectively not possible for all citizens to be represented at all times within a parliamentary institution.”\n\n99\n\nestabelecer-se caminhos alternativos. Leston-Bandeira explora a relação parlamento-cidadão em\n\nPortugal, que parece ter-se aprofundado na primeira década do século X XI, apesar do grande peso\n\ndos partidos e da pouca relevância que toma a relação com os círculos eleitorais. Esta\n\naproximação foi feita, mais em concreto, com a ajuda de iniciativas públicas e dos novos média.\n\nO legado histórico tem grande impacto nestas relações actuais, tanto numa perspectiva\n\ninstitucional, como cultural, assentando em mais de 100 anos de grande desconfiança em relação\n\naos políticos (monarquia constitucional, 1ª República e Estado Novo), rematada por uma\n\nrevolução convulsa. O caciquismo100 (nos dois primeiros períodos descritos) foi uma herança que\n\nficou bastante enraizada no contexto português e pode pôr em causa a respeitabilidade das\n\ninstituições. Por outro lado, o Estado Novo promoveu um afastamento da política, para fugir à\n\ncorrupção e instabilidade do tempo anterior. Neste cenário, a representação não teve oportunidade\n\nde se institucionalizar e ganhar peso. Por isso, aquando da revolução e criação da nova\n\nConstituição democrática, o regime procurou adquirir mais legitimidade e evitar os males do\n\npassado. Havia dois caminhos alternativos entre militares com democracia directa e partidos civis\n\ncom democracia representativa. A maioria silenciosa escolheu os segundos. Só agora o país tem\n\nsistemas de controlo que permitam responsabilizar a classe política. Mesmo assim, restou um\n\nsentimento de profunda desconfiança pelos representantes nacionais e locais. No presente,\n\nquando os cidadãos querem contestar alguma coisa, dirigem-se habitualmente ao partido ou ao\n\nseu grupo parlamentar respectivo. Podem mesmo às autoridades locais, mais do que a um\n\ndeterminado deputado designado como seu representante. Os níveis de confiança no parlamento\n\nsão relativamente baixos, mas parecem estar muito relacionados com um desconhecimento da\n\ninstituição ou com a popularidade do governo, no entanto a autora também fala de uma noção\n\nlargamente aceite de que a democracia portuguesa está frequentemente em apuros. Por isso, desde\n\n100\n\nLeston-Bandeira define caciquismo como uma actividade levada a cabo pelos representantes, em que prometem favores a uma dada localidade em troca de votos.\n\n100\n\nos anos 1990, a AR levou a cabo várias reformas que permitiram uma maior proximidade dos\n\ncidadãos. Como resultado, hoje a AR tem muita informação disponível online, promove\n\nactividades em que os cidadãos podem se envolver e facilitou o acesso directo aos deputados.\n\nLeston-Bandeira explica que estas modificações tiveram três vias diferentes: a promoção da\n\nactividade do parlamento a um nível individual, o desenvolvimento de canais de comunicação\n\ndirectos e a promoção do envolvimento dos cidadãos no processo parlamentar. Em primeiro\n\nlugar, fizeram uma revisão intensa do regulamento, introduzindo dias específicos dedicados aos\n\ndistritos eleitorais, dando possibilidade aos deputados de propor leis sem terem de passar pelo\n\nlíder parlamentar, disponibilizando informação sobre os deputados no site da AR e\n\nproporcionando mais condições para trabalharem (condições básicas são um gabinete, um\n\nassistente, um email institucional e uma página na internet), para dar alguns exemplos. A autora\n\nadverte que o aumento de condições dadas aos deputados não foi muito popular, pois pareceu ao\n\npúblico e à comunicação social mais um aumento desnecessário de recursos. “Uma maior\n\nindividualização do trabalho dos deputados pode levar a um maior envolvimento com o público,\n\njá que o trabalho parlamentar se torna menos anónimo e os problemas individuais podem\n\nadquirir maior visibilidade. (...) há sinais de um desenvolvimento tímido de uma representação\n\nmais do tipo trustee com maior visibilidade dos MPs individuais e representação mais local.”101\n\n(Leston-Bandeira, 2012b, pág. 390). Em segundo lugar, a AR passou a receber visitas e aumentou\n\na sua presença online (melhorias no site, mais informação, publicação do Diário da República\n\nonline). Criou-se também o Parlamento Jovem e começaram a organizar-se eventos e exposições\n\nregulares no edifício. Por fim, em terceiro lugar, começaram também a fazer fóruns de debate\n\npara novas leis, mas a participação tem sido muito baixa. Igualmente, o direito das petições foi\n\n101\n\nTradução livre de “A higher individualisation of deputies’ work can lead to better engagement with the public, as parliamentary work becomes less anonymous and individual issues can acquire greater visibility. (…) there are signs of a fledging development of a more trustee type of representation with higher visibility of individual MPs and a more locally based representation.”\n\n101\n\nmelhorado. No entanto, há críticas de que o processo não leva a grandes consequências. As\n\npetições são geralmente apresentadas por escrito, mas, desde 2003, também se pode submetê-las\n\nelectronicamente. Elas são avaliadas por uma comissão permanente adequada ou uma criada\n\napenas para esse propósito. Petições com 1000 assinaturas garantem uma audiência com a\n\ncomissão em questão. Se tiver 4000, tem direito a ser discutida na sessão plenária. Desde que\n\ncomeçou funções, as petições entregues à AR têm aumentado, com maior incidência na última\n\ndécada (de média de 5.52 ao mês no mandato de 1976-1980 para 11.88 no de 2011-2012). Houve\n\ndois picos de submissões coincidentes com as maiorias absolutas, períodos típicos de maior\n\nescrutínio. Antes dos anos 90, as petições eram quase sempre submetidas por sindicatos ou outros\n\ngrupos análogos, enquanto, no presente, já têm origem mais em indivíduos (de 37% individuais\n\nno mandato 1976-80 para 76% no de 2005-09). A principal crítica às petições é que levam muito\n\ntempo a atingir algum resultado concreto. Por lei, devem ser consideradas num espaço de 60 dias,\n\nmas isso quase nunca acontece na prática, podendo até demorar anos a chegar a alguma\n\nconclusão. Desde 1993, a AR tem um outro instrumento para ajudar a agilizar as petições,\n\nchamado de Diligência Conciliadora, em que deputados se reúnem com o cidadão que interpôs a\n\npetição e a entidade de que se queixa, numa tentativa de resolver o problema mais rapidamente\n\ncom acesso e negociação directos entre as partes.\n\nA propósito das petições, Do Legislative Petitions Systems Enhance the Relationship\n\nbetween Parliament and Citizen? (2012), da autoria de Richard Hough, é um artigo actual dos\n\nefeitos que a petição pode ter no estímulo à participação política. Leston-Bandeira também cita\n\nprofusamente o autor e vice-versa. As petições, apesar de serem um instrumento muito comum e\n\nantigo nos parlamentos, continuam a ser vistas como bastante ineficientes. Por essa razão, os\n\nsistemas de petições têm sido revistos por várias legislaturas, num contexto de afastamento do\n\npúblico da vida política. Este artigo analisa os sistemas de petições na Austrália, no Canadá, na\n\nAlemanha, na Escócia, Gales e Reino Unido, numa tentativa de perceber qual a sua real\n\n102\n\ncontribuição para a relação do parlamento com os cidadãos. É habitual a percepção de que as\n\npetições são “buracos negros” legislativos, pelo que as opiniões se dividem. Segundo o autor, as\n\npetições proporcionam três grandes vantagens: permitem uma outra ligação entre cidadãos e\n\nparlamento, mais informação e mais escrutínio e dão ao cidadão influência na alteração de\n\nlegislação. Os sistemas de petições variam muito de país para país, uns mais simples, outros mais\n\ncomplexos. O autor apresenta os critérios que pensa serem importantes para avaliar um processo\n\nde petições. São eles: se a legislatura tem ou não uma comissão dedicada às petições, se o\n\nacompanhamento é feito pelos deputados, se é permitida a submissão apenas por representantes\n\nou se todos o podem fazer, se há possibilidade de fazer petições online ou não, quando tempo\n\ncostuma demorar todo o processo, se o mesmo é justo e equilibrado, se tem um número mínimo\n\nde assinaturas estipulado e se tem prazo para a obtenção de uma resposta ou não. O crescimento\n\ndo e-petitioning, petições realizadas através da internet, é um sinal para optimismo. Facilitam em\n\nmuito o processo, reduzem os seus custos e burocracia. A Alemanha é um dos países onde esta\n\nferramenta está já a funcionar e se prova bastante eficaz e o Reino Unido, em 2011, criou o\n\nprimeiro site para o efeito. Todavia, este meio é ainda alvo de cepticismo e precisa de ser\n\ndesenvolvido. Num estudo feito aos deputados no parlamento escocês, descobriu-se que muita da\n\nmá imagem ou descrença em relação às petições prendia-se mais com desconhecimento do\n\nprocesso ou do papel das petições no sistema político. Assim que os cidadãos tinham algum\n\ncontacto efectivo, a sua opinião costumava alterar-se positivamente. Em geral, o processo de\n\npetições costuma ser moroso. As expectativas são de uma acção directa e imediata, o que pode\n\ntrazer algumas desilusões ao público. Mas mesmo não tendo os resultados desejados muitas das\n\nvezes, continuam a representar uma importante forma de mobilização de opinião, de recolha de\n\nsimpatias e de “válvula de segurança”. Hough aprecia que interessa mais o processo do que o\n\nresultado. Ter a oportunidade para apresentar uma petição parece ser mais relevante do que o\n\nefeito que ela terá. Mesmo que o resultado não seja o desejado, as pessoas, por regra, aceitam-no\n\nse acham que foram tratadas com justiça.\n\n103\n\nV. Novas tecnologias\n\nAs novas tecnologias têm sido uma aposta dos parlamentos para tentarem se aproximar\n\ndo eleitorado. Leston-Bandeira e Griffith (2012) explicam que muitos já recorreram a este meio,\n\nmas os seus resultados não são ainda muito visíveis, evidenciando a necessidade de um certo\n\nperíodo de adaptação. Uma boa gestão, pessoal capaz e financiamento são cruciais. As redes\n\nsociais, em especial, têm-se provado muito úteis nas campanhas. São das ferramentas favoritas\n\npara tornar os parlamentos mais abertos ao público, transparentes e passíveis de serem\n\nresponsabilizados. A primeira parte do artigo aborda o potencial da utilização de novas\n\ntecnologias no processo político. Os novos média permitem criar novas relações e aprofundar as\n\njá existentes. Oferecem um canal directo de comunicação e uma fonte de informação substancial.\n\nEles dão uma maior visibilidade aos parlamentos. Existem três níveis diferentes de relações: o\n\nparlamento, como um todo; os partidos e os deputados em nome individual. O parlamento, como\n\ninstituição, prova-se o mais difícil de fazer funcionar com sucesso uma relação deste género. “Os\n\nparlamentos têm de manter uma postura imparcial e apolítica enquanto transmitem conteúdo\n\npolítico.”102 (Leston-Bandeira & Griffith, 2012, pág. 398). Além do mais, os processos são\n\nsempre complexos e pesados, o que não se coaduna com a rapidez das novas tecnologias. Todos\n\nos três níveis enfrentam expectativas muito elevadas. Os autores explicam que a instituição\n\nparlamentar está habituada a ser bastante fechada ao público, dada a sua natureza de poder, de\n\ntomada de decisão, conciliação de interesses e resolução de conflitos. Estes, muitas vezes,\n\nrequerem deliberação à porta fechada, mas que isso já não é suficiente para a opinião pública. A\n\ninternet trouxe uma oportunidade de inverter esta tendência. Faz-se, pois, uma análise aos\n\nparlamentos pelo mundo com a ajuda dos resultados do Global Survey 2009, um relatório\n\n102\n\nTradução livre de “Parliaments have to keep na impartial and apolitical posture whilst conveying political content.”.\n\n104\n\nrealizado pela União Inter-parlamentar (IPU). Observa-se que, hoje em dia, os websites são a\n\nforma preferida de divulgar informação (97% dos parlamentos tinham o seu site próprio em\n\n2009). Ao fazer isso, tornam-se também uma importante fonte de legitimação. Há ainda sites\n\ndestinados ao trabalho das comissões especializadas (34% dos parlamentos usa sites para as\n\ncomissões) ou para os deputados (51% dos parlamentos responderam que “alguns” dos seus\n\ndeputados têm site próprio). Porém, a maior parte deles destina-se a passar informação para o\n\nexterior, ao invés de também procurar recolher informação ou opinião do público. Estas\n\ninovações não se têm desenvolvido da mesma forma em todo o mundo. Alguns parlamentos estão\n\nmais avançados do que outros e em níveis diferentes da relação com os cidadãos devido à falta de\n\nrecursos que alguns sofrem. Os autores também mencionam que, em certos países com um\n\nsistema partidário forte, os cidadãos podem preferir contactar o grupo parlamentar em vez de um\n\ncerto deputado. Dão o exemplo de uma comparação entre Portugal e o Reino Unido, onde, no\n\nprimeiro, se fazem contactos mais entre cidadão e GP e, no segundo, mais directamente ao M P. A\n\nanálise conclui que, apesar dos recentes desenvolvimentos, ainda muitos parlamentos falham em\n\ninformar convenientemente sobre o seu trabalho que cobre os seus principais deveres\n\nconstitucionais. Os que o fazem, preferem emissões de áudio e vídeo pela T V, rádio ou internet\n\nde actividades parlamentares (47% dos parlamentos, 29% planeiam fazê-lo num futuro próximo)\n\ne o envio de informação para dispositivos móveis (19% para MPs e 12% para o público). Um\n\ncampo que pode ser mais explorado é o dos meios alternativos para pessoas com deficiência.\n\nExistem alguns parlamentos que afirmam já tomar essas precauções, mas ainda muitos precisam\n\nde alargar o alcance das suas comunicações. Quanto aos emails, que já permitem um diálogo\n\nentre partes, 41% dos parlamentos, em 2009, tinha já a maioria dos MPs a usá-los e 27% em que\n\nas comissões já o faziam. Uma questão igualmente importante nas respostas aos cidadãos é quem\n\no deve fazer. Entre deputados, funcionários públicos, pessoal de apoio, representantes dos\n\npartidos e membros das comissões, quem está capacitado para falar em nome da instituição?\n\nOutros instrumentos usados que são interactivos, mas muito menos comuns, são as petições\n\n105\n\nelectrónicas, a consulta da opinião pública em certas leis ou a sua discussão em fóruns. Estes\n\nmostram uma tendência a se generalizarem no seio dos parlamentos. Os blogs também são\n\npopulares, especialmente entre os países de mais alto rendimento. Entre todos estes esforços para\n\nse aproximar dos cidadãos, há uma porção deles que são canalizados propositadamente para a\n\npopulação mais jovem, mais afastada desta realidade. Os parlamentos foram questionados sobre\n\nos 5 principais desafios que enfrentavam nesta área. Os resultados foram, em ordem decrescente:\n\na necessidade de simplificar estes meios para os deputados usarem; a simplificação dos processos\n\nlegislativos para permitir uma maior compreensão ao cidadão comum; o aumento de recursos e de\n\npessoal; melhoria das regras e procedimentos institucionais e uma optimização da estrutura\n\norganizacional, bem como das suas práticas.\n\nConcluindo, as novas tecnologias fizeram, até agora, um significativo e bem-sucedido\n\ncaminho na comunicação dos parlamentos com o público. No entanto, ainda há muito espaço para\n\nmelhorar. O relatório estudado estabelece critérios mínimos de desempenho e, segundo eles, a\n\nclassificação média de qualidade da comunicação e informação a nível mundial está muito aquém\n\ndo ideal normativo. Devido às grandes diferenças na disponibilidade de recursos, os mais ricos\n\ntêm um grande avanço em relação aos mais pobres. Avanço esse que não se justifica, se\n\ncomparado com outras dimensões avaliadas do desempenho do parlamento103. Neste relatório, só\n\na América Latina se aproxima da Europa. Contudo, isto pode ser motivado também por uma\n\ntímida penetração da internet nos países de baixo/médio rendimento. As diferenças institucionais\n\ne políticas também são importantes. O grau de independência que o parlamento tem em relação\n\nao governo pesa, assim como a autonomia relativa dos deputados face ao parlamento e aos grupos\n\nparlamentares.\n\n103\n\nNo mesmo relatório foram avaliados: a gestão e supervisão; os sistemas e documentos; serviços bibliotecários e de investigação e infraestrutura técnica.\n\n106\n\nBridging the e-democracy gap in Portugal (2006) é um ensaio que descreve os esforços da\n\nAssembleia portuguesa para chegar aos cidadãos através do uso das novas tecnologias. O artigo\n\nanalisa as práticas dos deputados portugueses relacionadas com a comunicação, quais as suas\n\nopiniões sobre o papel da internet na democracia e discute-se a designada e-democracy gap, o\n\nfosso na democracia electrónica, em Portugal. A hipótese proposta é que a forma como a internet\n\ntem sido usada na integração institucional não se tem traduzido numa maior participação política\n\nde facto. Os média são a principal fonte de opinião pública. Por isso, os políticos usam-nos\n\namplamente. Nos últimos tempos, registou-se um afastamento do público que os autores atribuem\n\na uma maior exigência da população perante um ideal de democracia e a respectiva divergência\n\nque acontece na prática. Neste sentido, as novas tecnologias e as possibilidades que oferecem\n\napresentam-se como uma forma fresca de tentar aproximar os cidadãos das suas instituições,\n\npromovendo a participação política. A internet tem potencialidade para isso, providenciando um\n\nespaço que, bem usado, pode fomentar o debate sem a pressão das hierarquias. Os autores\n\nmencionam que a internet tornaria possível uma espécie de “auditoria democrática”.\n\nAlgumas dificuldades estruturais são apontadas. A centralidade dos grupos parlamentares\n\né referida como um entrave à autonomia dos deputados em Portugal. Quando se deseja\n\nestabelecer contacto com algum deputado, quase sempre se faz através do grupo parlamentar.\n\nAdicionalmente, não existe o hábito de os deputados terem contacto próximo com o distrito por\n\nque são eleitos. O sistema português está delineado para que o deputado represente o país todo.\n\nAlém disso, muitos são substituídos ao longo do mandato, conferindo alguma inconstância na\n\nrepresentação. A AR perdeu alguma relevância na cena política durante as maiorias absolutas,\n\ntendo passado de uma posição mais forte na função legislativa para uma mais de legitimação. No\n\nentanto, desde os anos 90, empreendeu vários esforços para se tornar uma instituição mais forte e\n\nse abrir ao público. Foi nesta altura que se criou a ART V, o canal que emite as sessões plenárias.\n\nNo entanto, ironicamente, a entrada das novas tecnologias foi inspirada por uma petição por parte\n\n107\n\ndos eleitores. A petição foi submetida em 1999 por um grupo de seu nome GUIA – Grupo\n\nPortuguês pelas Iniciativas em Acessibilidade. O GUIA constituiu-se como um movimento social\n\n(em tudo parecido com os ideais pós-materialistas) e foi capaz de mobilizar vários organismos,\n\ngrupos e agentes sociais e o público em geral, através do recurso a muitas dessas mesmas vias que\n\ndefendiam perante o parlamento (exemplos são fóruns online, listas de email, grupos de debate,\n\nvoto online, divulgação de documentos e relatórios relacionados, conferências de imprensa e\n\nsímbolos de protesto).\n\nNa comunicação com o público, um estudo de 2001/02 descobriu que os deputados\n\nportugueses preferem o uso da televisão, em primeiro lugar, e, depois, os jornais. Somente um\n\nterço considera a internet importante. Mais de metade, 56.4%, usa email e cerca de 5 em cada 6\n\nconsultam-no diariamente. Quanto a páginas pessoais, apenas 5.1% tinha em 2001/02. Como\n\nferramenta, a internet é usada, tanto para comunicação interna, como externa. No entanto, dentro\n\nda comunicação externa, o contacto com os eleitores do seu distrito é o que acontece menos (2.8\n\nnuma escala de 1 a 7, em que 1 é nenhum uso de novas tecnologias e 7 é o uso frequente das\n\nmesmas). Também só uma pequena minoria é que participa em fóruns de discussão e pouco\n\nfrequentemente. O estudo revela que os deputados preferem contactar com outros agentes\n\nsemelhantes, em vez de falar directamente com os cidadãos, apesar de os eleitores serem os que\n\nmais pedem atenção. A comunicação horizontal é mais frequente que a vertical. Conclui-se que\n\nos deputados sabem e, efectivamente, usam as novas tecnologias, mas não as aproveitam\n\nconvenientemente para se aproximar do público. Quando questionados sobre este facto, muitos\n\ndeputados apontaram razões estruturais e culturais, além da demasiada afluência para poucos\n\nrecursos. Mencionam também a ideia de que as intervenções dos cidadãos são maioritariamente\n\n“irreflectidas” e “simplistas”. A maioria dos deputados concorda com a inserção destes novos\n\ninstrumentos no campo político, no entanto são desfavoráveis ao voto electrónico e à votação na\n\npopularidade. São ainda algo cépticos em relação ao efeito positivo que estes podem trazer na\n\n108\n\nparticipação pública. Do lado do público, num estudo de 1997, 68% dos entrevistados respondeu\n\nque não participava nestas iniciativas da AR, no entanto a internet não se havia espalhado ainda\n\npela generalidade da população.\n\nOs autores recomendam que essas actividades continuem a ser desenvolvidas e que os\n\ndeputados procurem formas de usar a internet como forma de instigar a participação e a\n\nmotivação. A sua conclusão é que existia, em 2006, mesmo um fosso na e-democracy em\n\nPortugal. “Não só há uma fraca propensão para participar e uma visão negativa do papel dos\n\nMPs por parte do público; mas também há uma falta de incentivos na parte dos deputados, no\n\nque toca a participação pública via internet. (…) Infelizmente, os MPs não aproveitaram a\n\noportunidade. (…) No presente a reacção parece ser de aumentar o envolvimento do público na\n\nrelação com a administração pública via a acessibilidade de serviços online, o designado e governo. Não obstante, o público (mesmo que não todo) parece continuar a usar a internet como\n\numa ferramenta para a acção cívica através do protesto, mobilização e, por vezes, propostas\n\ndireccionadas aos órgãos soberanos, desta forma exercendo uma democracia digital.”104\n\n(Cardoso, Cunha & Nascimento, 2006, pág. 467).\n\nVI. O Futuro da Assembleia da República\n\nDepois da sua análise, Freire (2002) apresenta uma série de medidas para uma reforma à AR.\n\nQuanto ao número de deputados na AR, Freire acha que é adequado. Existem muitas sugestões\n\n104\n\nTradução livre de “Not only is there a weak propensity to participate and a negative vision of the role of the MPs on the part of the public; but there is also a lack of incentive on the part of Deputies regarding public participation via the Internet. (…) Unfortunately, the MPS have not capitalized on the opportunity. (…) Currently the institutional response appears to be to increasingly involve the public in a relationship with the public administration via online service accessibility, the so-called e-government. Nevertheless, the public (even if not all) appears to continue to appropriate the Internet as a tool for civic action through protest, mobilization and, at times, proposals directed to sovereign organs, in this way exercising digital democracy.”\n\n109\n\npara diminuir esta quantidade, mas, em comparação, o autor diz que o país se enquadra no resto\n\ndos países europeus. Contudo, uma sugestão que faz é tornar o número de deputados ímpar para\n\nprevenir situações de empate técnico, o que já causou dissabores à AR. Sobre a possiblidade de\n\ncriação ou não de uma segunda Câmara, o autor defende que os riscos que se correm em criá-la\n\n(aumento da animosidade do público face ao parlamento e entre regiões autónomas, demasiado\n\npeso dado à técnica legislativa em detrimento da política) não compensarão, porventura, os\n\nganhos. Numa perspectiva mais funcional, Freire sugere acabar com as listas bloqueadas e com\n\npossibilidade de prolongar os mandatos nos cargos a eleger pela AR. No processo de integração\n\neuropeia, a cargo da AR, acha que: se deve permitir um voto desfavorável a todos os programas\n\nnormativos da EU que compreendam competências da AR; dar poder de participação à AR nesse\n\nprocesso normativo; dar poder de participação na eleição de altas figuras da EU (Comissão);\n\nincumbir o governo de apresentar um relatório anual sobre a implementação das normas\n\ncomunitárias; abrir uma representação em Bruxelas; prever a integração de deputados nas\n\ndelegações nacionais, na sede do Conselho e, por fim, aprofundar as ligações entre deputados da\n\nAR e do Parlamento Europeu (PE).\n\nOs instrumentos de fiscalização são considerados suficientes. A sua prática poderia ser\n\nmelhorada, mas depende mais dos hábitos ou da mudança de regras noutras estâncias que a eles\n\nestão relacionados (sistema eleitoral e partidário, por exemplo). Mesmo dentro da AR, o autor\n\nmenciona reformular o processo de perguntas ao governo; melhorar o processo dos inquéritos\n\nparlamentares e acertar os debates especiais, (duas voltas nos debates de urgência e a\n\ninstitucionalização da periodicidade dos debates das comissões especializadas e do debate mensal\n\ncom o PM). Nas competências legislativas, não há necessidade de aumento, mas aconselha-se a\n\nracionalização de algumas delas. Quanto à forma como se organiza o trabalho parlamentar, o\n\nautor aponta para uma necessidade de aumentar a sua flexibilidade, tanto no debate plenário,\n\ncomo no trabalho das comissões, mais concretamente com o aumento do apoio técnico e da\n\n110\n\nprofissionalização do trabalho parlamentar e com a promoção de uma relação mais próxima entre\n\nparlamento e cidadãos. Desde a IV Legislatura, o nível de profissionalização dos deputados ronda\n\nos 80%.“ (...) as propostas que se apresentam têm dois objectivos principais: criar condições\n\npara uma maior aproximação entre deputados e eleitores; e fortalecer o papel dos deputados na\n\nfunção de representação política, tornando-os mais autónomos perante as direcções dos seus\n\npartidos e mais legitimados face aos militantes.” (Freire, 2002, pág. 163). Mais importante, na\n\nrelação com o cidadão, Freire aconselha: o desenvolvimento de instrumentos já existentes (como\n\né o caso das linhas verdes e da internet); a alteração do modelo de debate de petições, com\n\npossibilidade de pedidos de esclarecimentos e adopção do debate, na generalidade; a recriação da\n\nComissão de Petições, ainda que diferente das restantes comissões especializadas (coordenação\n\ndo tratamento das petições distribuídas às comissões especializadas, agendamento e outras\n\niniciativas relativas ao tratamento das petições e difusão de informação sobre esta matéria). No\n\nsistema eleitoral: diminuição dos círculos eleitorais grandes e médios, criação de um círculo\n\nnacional de compensação à proporcionalidade; maior apoio ao trabalho dos deputados nos seus\n\ncírculos eleitorais. Para fechar, no que concerne o recrutamento: a descentralização do\n\nrecrutamento; uma maior transparência no recrutamento; promoção da diversidade\n\nsociodemográfica e profissional do perfil dos parlamentares (mais mulheres, mais jovens e\n\nindivíduos de mérito que não sejam políticos profissionais) e alterações sugeridas nos estatutos\n\ndos deputados.\n\n111\n\nCapítulo 3. Análise comparativa\n\nEsta parte da análise estatística abrange os conceitos teóricos apresentados anteriormente,\n\naferindo o seu alcance em Portugal e, comparando alguns dos dados com outras três democracias\n\neuropeias, no sentido de proporcionar uma perspectiva comparada do assunto. Os países\n\nescolhidos sao: a Espanha, a Alemanha e o Reino Unido. Espanha por ser também ser uma\n\ndemocracia recente e relativamente parecida com a portuguesa. A Alemanha era um dos países\n\napontados por Dalton como uma das democracias com mais pendor pós-materialista e o Reino\n\nUnido que, apesar de ter a mais antiga democracia que ainda se mantém nos dias de hoje, parece\n\nalicerçar-se muito na tradição e resistir ao avanço desta mudança de valores. Tal como foi\n\nanteriormente referido, esta secção será compreendida por três partes distintas, mas todas\n\nrelacionadas entre si. A primeira compreende uma percepção do perfil do cidadão pós materialista, em oposição ao materialista, no que toca a valores e comportamentos; a segunda,\n\numa análise da relação entre os cidadãos e as suas respectivas instituições e a terceira, também\n\numa relação, mas mais especificamente a convergência entre deputados e eleitorado. A partir de\n\ninformação proveniente do European Values Study105, tentar-se-á identificar se a sociedade\n\nportuguesa mostra sinais do despontar pós-materialista. Portugal, participou nas vagas de 1989 1993, 1999-2004 e 2008-2010. Depois, com o auxílio do Eurobarómetro, do Banco Mundial, do\n\nEurostat, dos dados da ONU e da Transparency International, tenta-se construir um contexto que\n\npermita perceber condições favoráveis ou desfavoráveis ao desenrolar do pós-materialismo. Por\n\nfim, usando o estudo feito pelo CESOP junto dos deputados, afere-se o nível de congruência entre\n\n105\n\nNeste estudo, a delimitação geográfica do Reino Unido restringe-se à Grã-Bretanha, pelo que a análise será efectuada para a última como proxy do primeiro. Da mesma forma, o último momento de recolha na Grã-Bretanha foi em 2009, enquanto, nos outros países, foi em 2008. Apesar de terem sido em anos diferentes, fazem parte da mesma vaga de pesquisa, pelo que podem ser comparáveis. Há, apenas, que ter em mente esse pormenor.\n\n112\n\nas suas opiniões e as dos seus eleitores para detectar o seu grau de proximidade ideológica e no\n\nestabelecimento de prioridades para o país. Todas estas perspectivas são complementares entre si,\n\numa vez que todas procuram observar mais de perto o mesmo fenómeno, mas de ângulos\n\ndiversos.\n\nRecapitulando, os dois principais autores a escreverem a respeito do fenómeno surgente\n\ndo pós-materialismo foram Ronald Inglehart (1977) e Russell J. Dalton (2008). O primeiro\n\navançou com a Teoria da Modernização Cultural, que previa (e estudava os primeiros sinais) de\n\numa alteração na matriz axiológica das sociedades em países desenvolvidos, que foi possibilitada\n\npelo período de relativa paz no mundo seguido da Segunda Grande Guerra e intenso crescimento\n\neconómico, que permitiu aos indivíduos terem assegurada a sobrevivência nos seus primeiros\n\nanos de vida. Uma pessoa com acesso a boas condições de vida em criança tende a crescer para\n\nser um adulto que se concentra menos em segurança e estabilidade material e mais em valores\n\nmais abstractos como a qualidade de vida, a individualidade, a liberdade e a igualdade. Inglehart\n\nfez uso dos termos “pós-capitalista” e “pós-bourgeois”, ambos bastante descritivos da disposição\n\ndeste tipo de indivíduo, uma vez que a sua principal característica será a sobreposição de valores\n\nde liberdade individual e de expressão pessoal em detrimento de valores materiais, como um\n\nrendimento confortável, por exemplo. O emprego do termo bourgeois é especialmente\n\ninteressante, pelo facto de esta alteração fundamental na sociedade ter sido principalmente\n\nmotivada por uma classe média/ média-alta que acabou por se tornar dominante nestes países e o\n\nprincipal motor desta mudança. Dalton, algum tempo depois, usou informação empírica para dar\n\nconta de um aumento progressivo da sofisticação do eleitor/cidadão e, com isso, um maior\n\ninteresse na política, o que abre todo um novo leque de potencial participação. Dalton esteve na\n\norigem da expressão mais usada actualmente, que é “pós-materialismo”.\n\nO perfil pós-materialista, em concreto, compreende uma deslocação de valores\n\ntradicionais para outros de cariz mais individualista e secular. O pós-materialista encara a\n\n113\n\ndiversidade cultural e de opiniões como algo positivo, que, a ser encorajado, trará\n\nnecessariamente benefícios. A globalização e as novas tecnologias possibilitaram-lhe estar mais\n\nligado ao mundo e, por isso, concebê-lo, não apenas como um conjunto de lugares e povos\n\ndiferentes, mas mais como um todo, com uma só Humanidade. As fronteiras raciais, étnicas,\n\nreligiosas, de género e de preferência sexual esbatem-se. O materialista, em contraste, é apegado\n\nà tradição e à autoridade, tendo, por norma, receio do diferente e do desconhecido, desafiando\n\npouco o status-quo. Nas suas prioridades, está o conforto material e a defesa militar. Ao contrário\n\ndas gerações anteriores, o pós-materialista tem preocupações mais filosóficas e com a qualidade\n\nde vida. É mais avesso à autoridade, premiando organizações de carácter horizontal (com uma\n\nhierarquia pouco rígida), em que cada um tem algo a contribuir. A individualidade e a expressão\n\npessoal são encorajadas. A liberdade é bastante prezada e a sua protecção é central nesta\n\nsociedade. A religião perde o seu lugar de relevância na moralidade e uma visão mais secular\n\nprolifera. No entanto, esta quebra na religião não significa necessariamente uma quebra na\n\nprocura espiritual, que parece até intensificar-se. Estes indivíduos parecem procurar cada vez\n\nmais o seu próprio caminho e a sua própria realização pessoal. Além disso, o nível de confiança\n\nentre a população costuma ser elevado e a corrupção com pouca expressão. No contexto do pós materialismo, muitos são os conceitos que vão reaparecendo sob uma nova forma ou\n\ninterpretação. Entre eles, é importante mencionar a abordagem à política. A democracia neste\n\ncontexto está plenamente instalada, mas não é constante, nem estanque. As expectativas face às\n\ninstituições crescem, pelo que o cepticismo alastra nestas sociedades. Cada vez se regista uma\n\nmenor participação através do voto. Esta tendência foi inicialmente encarada como um mero\n\ndesinteresse crescente por parte dos eleitores. Contudo, Dalton conclui que tal não é o que\n\nefectivamente se passa. Os pós-materialistas, motivados pelas expectativas frustradas quanto ao\n\nfuncionamento das suas instituições, desvalorizam o voto, encarando-o como uma participação\n\nmínima e manifestam uma maior vontade de se envolver de outras formas, mais intensas, na sua\n\npolítica local e nacional, ou até internacional. Os contornos da participação política são\n\n114\n\nrenovados. Da mesma forma, a militância em partidos dá lugar a iniciativas civis, movimentos\n\nsociais, petições, boicotes e protestos variados e criativos. Os assuntos na agenda do dia são de\n\num cariz diferente, com mais atenção à protecção ambiental e às liberdades individuais (alguns\n\nexemplos são o casamento homossexual, eutanásia, a igualdade entre sexos ou até a pirataria\n\ninformática). A noção de comunidade também é desafiada. O cidadão pós-materialista é, em\n\ngeral, mais instruído, interessa-se mais pelo que se passa e não pretende deixar o controlo da sua\n\nvida a mãos alheias. Dele, é conhecido um maior sentido de responsabilidade social e maior\n\nentrega à sua comunidade através de mais trabalho voluntário em associações cívicas ou\n\norganizações não-governamentais/sem fins lucrativos.\n\nMas não é só do lado da sociedade civil que se registam mudanças. Também as\n\ninstituições têm procurado abrir-se ao público. A Assembleia da República empreendeu uma série\n\nde reformas, com maior intensidade a partir dos anos 90, que abriram a instituição ao eleitorado\n\ncomo nunca antes. É verdade que, em Portugal, o protesto tem-se generalizado e diversificado, as\n\npetições submetidas têm aumentado e tivemos alguns referendos (três, mas nunca com uma\n\nparticipação acima dos 50%). No entanto, como vimos, isso parece não se traduzir ainda numa\n\nparticipação mais intensa ou numa influência efectiva na actividade das instituições políticas,\n\ncom maior atenção à AR, para este caso.\n\nPor fim, há que salientar que os indivíduos não são puramente materialistas ou pós materialistas, mas, sim, movem-se ao longo de um espectro cujos extremos são essas duas\n\nmodalidades. É comum uma pessoa ter uma mentalidade materialista para certos temas e noutras\n\náreas revelar-se com um pendor mais pós-materialista. No decorrer do processo de transformação\n\nsocial, que dura várias gerações, é natural observar-se uma grande porção de indivíduos que\n\napresentam um perfil misto dentro desta dicotomia. Analisemos, então, as estatísticas.\n\n115\n\nI. Perfil do cidadão\n\nO European Values Study contempla uma série de perguntas que se destinam a saber mais\n\nsobre os cidadãos dos vários países europeus, nomeadamente no que diz respeito aos seus valores,\n\na sua forma de estar na vida, percepção de si próprio e dos outros, da vida em sociedade, entre\n\noutros aspectos. Estas perguntas, apesar de não serem inequívocas quanto à classificação de um\n\ncidadão como pós-materialista, podem proporcionar bons indicadores (variáveis “proxy”) para\n\nconfirmar ou negar determinados traços característicos que estão muito presentes na literatura\n\nsobre o assunto. Por conseguinte, reuniu-se uma bateria de perguntas desse tipo que ajudam a\n\ndescrever nove eixos de traços dicotómicos entre as duas posturas, de entre as várias categorias\n\ndo EVS que cobrem essas características e, em comparação lado-a-lado com as outras três\n\ndemocracias seleccionadas, permitem ter uma noção de onde Portugal se situa em termos\n\nrelativos e se mostra sinais de alguma transformação social ou não. Em alguns pontos de análise,\n\ninformação complementar é tirada das agências da ONU, do Banco Mundial e do Eurostat para\n\ndar a conhecer melhor o contexto em que estas populações se desenvolvem.\n\nTodas estas características, apesar de aqui enunciadas em separado, estão, na verdade,\n\ninterrelacionadas, constituindo partes de um todo que é essa disposição pós-materialista. A\n\ncontraposição com o materialismo e a divisão em vários pontos que constituem traços\n\ncaracterísticos serve somente o propósito de facilitar a análise, mas é bom ter em mente que estes\n\nsão diferentes faces de uma totalidade indivisível e complexa.\n\n116\n\nQuadro 2: Materialismo vs. Pós-materialismo – características\n\nMaterialismo Pós-materialismo\n\nSobrevivência incerta nos primeiros anos de\n\nvida\n\nSobrevivência garantida nos primeiros anos\n\nde vida\n\nPrioridade dada ao conforto material Prioridade dada à qualidade de vida\n\nReligiosidade Secularismo\n\nDeferência à autoridade Pouca deferência à autoridade\n\nFoco em manter a tradição Foco na expressão pessoal\n\nPouco ecológico Muito ecológico\n\nNacionalista Internacionalista\n\nO Outro como ameaça/competição O Outro como semelhante (ser humano)\n\nSociedade civil fraca Sociedade civil forte\n\ni. Sobrevivência nos primeiros anos de vida\n\nA probabilidade de sobrevivência de uma criança nos seus primeiros anos de vida revela\n\nbastante sobre o contexto em que veio ao mundo. Revela as condições de saúde oferecidas no seu\n\npaís aquando do seu nascimento, eventuais cuidados pré-natais e saúde da mãe, bem como\n\ncuidados médicos no próprio dia. Quando um país começa a desenvolver-se, a quebra na\n\n117\n\nmortalidade infantil é, regra geral, um dos primeiros sinais da mudança. Isso não significa que um\n\npaís com uma baixa mortalidade infantil seja necessariamente desenvolvido. Existem países em\n\ndesenvolvimento com taxas de mortalidade infantil reduzidas, no entanto não se conhecem países\n\ndesenvolvidos que tenham taxas de natalidade ditas elevadas. Por esta razão, este indicador é\n\nusado muitas vezes para demonstrar o grau de avanço na modernização de um país. Além disso,\n\nInglehart e Dalton mencionam a garantia de segurança na primeira infância como uma\n\ncaracterística determinante para se ser pós-materialista. É esse facto de não ter tido a sua\n\nsobrevivência ameaçada que muda de forma fundamental a maneira do cidadão encarar o mundo.\n\nOs valores que ele adquire nesta idade perdurarão, mais ou menos estáveis, pelo resto da sua vida.\n\nGráfico nº 1: Taxa de Mortalidade Infantil (0-5 anos) 106\n\nFonte: Organização Mundial de Saúde - ONU\n\n106\n\nDescreve a probabilidade de uma criança morrer entre os 0 e os 5 anos, por cada 1000 nascimentos.\n\n118\n\nPortugal, em 1980, aparece claramente desfasado do grupo de países escolhidos. A\n\nAlemanha e o Reino Unido mostram taxas muito mais reduzidas que as de Portugal e Espanha. A\n\núltima, apesar de se posicionar um pouco atrás dos outros dois, continuava muito mais perto\n\ndestes do que do seu país limítrofe. Para uma pessoa que tenha nascido no início dos anos 80,\n\ncom 30 e poucos anos por agora, a taxa de sobrevivência era ainda muito diferente entre os quatro\n\npaíses. No Reino Unido e na Alemanha, era mais provável ter os primeiros anos de vida sem\n\ngrandes sobressaltos. Os anos 80 e 90 parecem ter sido importantes para Portugal em termos de\n\nmelhoria dos cuidados de saúde. De um nível de cerca de 15 crianças perdidas, por cada mil,\n\npassou a apenas 7 em 2000, o que representa uma quebra de acima de metade (53%) na\n\nmortalidade infantil em apenas 10 anos. Em 2010, Portugal atingiu o patamar da Alemanha,\n\nultrapassando a Espanha e o Reino Unido. Os quatro países viram melhorar continuamente as\n\nsuas capacidades para assegurar a sobrevivência dos seus cidadãos mais novos. No entanto,\n\nnenhuma melhoria foi tão acentuada quanto a portuguesa. Em duas décadas, a mortalidade\n\ninfantil portuguesa foi reduzida em cerca de 73%. No Reino Unido, apenas 44%. Em 2012, o ano\n\nmais recente de que há dados, os números e as posições relativas mantiveram-se. Estes valores\n\nparecem indiciar que Portugal, pelos anos 90, ainda estava consideravelmente mais atrasado que\n\nos seus companheiros europeus, mas que, em 20 anos, conseguiu desenvolver-se e melhorar as\n\ncondições de vida da sua população de uma forma significativa.\n\n119\n\nGráfico nº 2 – Esperança Média de Vida\n\nFonte: Banco Mundial\n\nPara completar um pouco este raciocínio, a Esperança Média de Vida (EMV) é também um\n\nbom indicador de boas condições de vida. As populações que vivem mais tempo, geralmente\n\nlevam uma vida mais saudável e têm bom acesso a cuidados de saúde. E pode ver-se que,\n\nrealmente, a EMV tem aumentado bastante nas últimas duas décadas, apesar de, em 1990, a\n\nEuropa já ter pessoas a viver mais tempo que no resto do mundo. Como se trata de países\n\neuropeus, as diferenças não são muito acentuadas. Em todos, a tendência é crescente. Portugal\n\ntem a EMV mais reduzida ao longo de todo este período (78.7 anos em 2009), enquanto a\n\nEspanha tem a mais elevada, chegando aos 81.5 anos de vida em 2009. Em termos de aumento\n\nefectivo, portugueses e alemães foram os que tiveram, em média, uma vida mais prolongada, com\n\nmais 6.4 anos entre 1990 e 2009. O Reino Unido foi, de todos, o que sofreu um aumento mais\n\nligeiro, rondando os 5.4 anos.\n\n120\n\nii. Prioridade na vida\n\nA grande diferença entre materialistas e pós-materialistas, dir-se-ia a primordial, é na relação\n\nque têm com os bens materiais. Os materialistas cresceram num ambiente em que a comodidade\n\nmaterial era intermitente e, por isso, a sua valorização desta componente na sua vida tem a\n\nmáxima prioridade. Os materialistas dedicam grande parte do seu tempo e restantes recursos para\n\ngarantir esta estabilidade. Procuram um emprego estável, uma casa e um carro. Estes são os\n\ncomponentes necessários à sua realização pessoal. No caso dos pós-materialistas, a sobrevivência\n\nnão era ameaçada e, por isso, não havia essa preocupação nos primeiros anos, o que permitiu que\n\num outro tipo de valores, mais abstractos e mais filosóficos, se elevassem em detrimento dos\n\nmateriais. O pós-materialista aprecia a segurança material, mas não se contenta com isso. Quer\n\num emprego que lhe permita expressar a sua individualidade, mesmo que o salário seja mais\n\ncomedido. Ter uma boa qualidade de vida é de suma importância. Ser saudável de corpo e mente\n\né muito importante e, muitas vezes, não passa por ter muito dinheiro, mas em o usar bem.\n\nGráficos nº 3 e 4 – Relação dos cidadãos com o dinheiro\n\n121\n\nBase: Total de 20 144 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nNo seio dos pós-materialistas, o dinheiro perde um pouco o seu brilho. É muito mais\n\nencarado como um meio do que como um fim. Os bens materiais, neste contexto, adquirem um\n\npapel secundário. Nos gráficos, estão representadas opiniões dos cidadãos de cada país,\n\nrelativamente a considerarem uma menor ênfase no dinheiro algo bom ou mau. Em geral, todos\n\nos países desta selecção consideram isto algo bom (mais de metade da população em todos). Estes\n\nresultados são interessantes, pois a Alemanha, que, noutras variáveis, se revela\n\nproporcionalmente mais pós-materialista, continua a dar grande importância ao dinheiro, mais do\n\nque os outros países que aqui figuram. A Espanha destaca-se como a que se preocupa menos,\n\nenquanto a Alemanha é a que se preocupa mais. Portugal, mais uma vez se destaca, pela maior\n\nevolução. Depois de uma ligeira redução na primeira década (de 63.2% para 58.4%), a\n\npercentagem de portugueses que consideram bom o facto de dar menos peso à parte material\n\naumentou consideravelmente (78.4%). A tendência simétrica pode observar-se nos que\n\nconsideram a atribuição de menos peso ao dinheiro como algo mau – um ligeiro aumento na\n\nprimeira década e uma quebra acentuada na segunda. Em 2008, Portugal (10.8%) aproxima-se de\n\n122\n\nEspanha (10.1%) e Grã-Bretanha (6.2%), deixando a Alemanha isolada (23.7%). Os cidadãos de\n\nPortugal, Espanha e Grã-Bretanha parecem ter uma relação cada vez mais desinteressada com o\n\ndinheiro, ao passo que os da Alemanha persistem nesta convicção.\n\nGráfico nº 5 – Taxa de Crescimento real anual do Produto Interno Bruto\n\nFonte: Eurostat\n\nInglehart defende que a relação com o dinheiro esmorece em detrimento de outras\n\nnecessidades mais abstractas se começarmos a vida com o suficiente para estar confortável. Por\n\nisso, é relevante verificar o crescimento económico de que tiram partido as gerações actuais.\n\nAqui, recua-se um pouco a análise para ver o ambiente a que foram expostos os indivíduos com\n\n30 anos, ou seja, quem está em plena condição de cidadão (maior de 18 anos), mas ainda é\n\nrelativamente novo para não ter vivido sob o regime salazarista. As economias da Alemanha e o\n\nReino Unido eram mais avançadas do que as de Portugal e Espanha em 1984.No início do\n\nperíodo, é clara a desvantagem de Portugal em relação aos outros países, com um crescimento\n\nnegativo. Os outros três cresceram, mesmo que moderamente, algo típico da Europa desta altura.\n\n123\n\nA segunda metade da década de 80 foi bastante diferente, de maior crescimento nos quatro países\n\ne especialmente favorável a Portugal e Espanha, o que, muito provavelmente, foi incentivado pela\n\nadesão à então Comunidade Económica Europeia (CEE), actual União Europeia, que teve lugar\n\nem 1986. Em 1989, a economia espanhola cresceu 4,8% e a portuguesa atingiu um confortável\n\naumento de 6,4%. A evolução posterior do panorama português teve altos e baixos, evidenciando\n\nalguma instabilidade económica. Espanha, Alemanha e Reino Unido também mostram algumas\n\noscilações, mas de menor amplitude. A crise financeira de 2008 não poupou nenhum deles. Em\n\n2009, todos tiveram taxas negativas de crescimento, com impacto mais forte na Alemanha e\n\nReino Unido. Não obstante, este dois últimos conseguiram recuperar e, em 2012, apresentaram\n\ncrescimento positivo, enquanto Espanha e Portugal ainda se debatiam. A economia portuguesa,\n\nem recessão, teve um crescimento negativo em 3,2% em 2012 face ao ano anterior. Estas\n\ndificuldades podem prejudicar a progressão do pós-materialismo, uma vez que introduzem mais\n\nincerteza na prosperidade das populações.\n\nGráfico nº 6 – Grau de Desenvolvimento Humano (IDH)\n\n124\n\nFonte: Relatório de Desenvolvimento Humano, Programa das Nações Unidas para o Desenvolvimento - ONU\n\nDa mesma forma, mas num âmbito mais alargado do que o simples crescimento económico, o\n\nÍndice de Desenvolvimento Humano dá conta do nível de qualidade de vida das populações\n\nnestes países. É atribuída uma cotação entre 0 e 1 que os coloca em posições relativas uns aos\n\noutros. Portugal é, mais uma vez, o que vai mais atrasado neste campo, mesmo que\n\nacompanhando a tendência crescente. Os países que viram a sua posição relativa aumentar mais\n\nforam Alemanha e Espanha. Portugal foi o que menos evoluiu no ranking, pelo que terá um clima\n\nmenos favorável à multiplicação de indivíduos com carácter pós-materialista.\n\niii. Relação com a Religião\n\nQuanto às necessidades espirituais, os materialistas costumam ser mais devotos a uma\n\ndada religião, qualquer que ela seja. Como gostam de preservar a tradição, mantêm os preceitos\n\nmorais e comportamentos associados a cada credo. O seu quotidiano reveste-se de sinais da\n\npresença da religião. Com os pós-materialistas, o que acontece é um afastamento da religião. A\n\nsua vida quotidiana de eleição é secular. Em geral, os pós-materialistas consideram-se ateus. No\n\nentanto, não são completamente cépticos e desprovidos de espiritualidade. Tentam, sim, outras\n\nvias de traçar um caminho de procura espiritual mais íntimo e pessoal.\n\n125\n\nGráfico nº 7 – Importância da religião na vida do cidadão\n\nBase: Total de 20 411 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study107\n\nNeste aspecto, os portugueses mostram-se muito mais religiosos do que os seus pares\n\neuropeus. Nos anos 90, a tendência parecia seguir ainda uma rota ascendente. A década seguinte\n\nregistou uma ligeira descida, mas a grande maioria da população continua a afirmar-se religiosa.\n\nNa Alemanha, acontece o contrário. Em 1990, cerca de apenas um terço da população (34%)\n\ndizia-se religiosa. Nas duas últimas décadas, tem-se reforçado este afastamento (27% em 2008).\n\nNo meio destes dois países, estão os intermédios Espanha e Grã-Bretanha, mas a evoluir\n\n(ligeiramente) em sentidos diferentes. O número de religiosos espanhóis está em declínio (38.9%\n\nem 2008) e o britânico aumentou na última década (43.9% em 2008). Resta saber as motivações\n\npor detrás deste regresso à religião.\n\n107\n\nOs valores apresentados resultam da soma do número de respostas “very important” com as “quite important”, de modo a representarem o volume de entrevistados que são, de alguma forma, religiosos.\n\n126\n\nGráfico nº 8 – Importância da religião na vida do cidadão II\n\nBase: Total de 19 375 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nO gráfico 5 mostra a proporção de pessoas religiosas, não religiosas (podem simpatizar com\n\nalguma religião, mas não seguem os seus preceitos – o designado “não praticante”) e ateus\n\nconvictos. Este confirma a preponderância religiosa em Portugal indicada no anterior. Na\n\nAlemanha e em Espanha, o número de pessoas religiosas perde terreno para as não religiosas e as\n\nateias. Na primeira, em 2008, os não religiosos e ateus ultrapassaram o número de pessoas que\n\nsegue alguma religião. Mesmo em Portugal, a tendência parece ser de baixa, apesar de ainda a\n\npredominância da religião ser ainda muito forte. A Grã-Bretanha é marcada por um regresso\n\nligeiro à religiosidade, mas há que apontar a pouca diferença entre o grupo religioso (48.3% em\n\n2008) e o que se afirma não religioso (45.3%), enquanto nos outros países as diferenças são\n\nbastante mais acentuadas.\n\n127\n\niv. Relação com a autoridade\n\nA relação com a autoridade também é uma característica muito relevante na distinção entre\n\nmaterialistas e pós-materialistas. Os primeiros valorizam a obediência e ordem, por isso não\n\ncostumam contestar o que lhes é dito ou ordenado. Mesmo que concordem ou não com os\n\npreceitos dados pelo seu superior hierárquico, tendem a apenas aceder e não questionar. A pessoa\n\nque está nessa posição terá as suas razões, pensam. Como consequência, a sociedade materialista\n\né caracterizada por hierarquias rígidas, povoadas por organizações de cariz vertical. Os pós materialistas não são tão tementes à autoridade. Como valorizam muito a expressão pessoal e a\n\nindividualidade, também tendem a ser mais exigentes com as motivações e intenções de quem\n\ntem poder sobre si. Nas sociedades em transformação, assiste-se ao surgimento de organizações\n\ncada vez mais horizontais, onde hierarquias não fazem grande sentido e, por isso, vão se tornando\n\nmais flexíveis.\n\nNo começo da vida, os pais são as principais (e, muitas vezes, as únicas) figuras de\n\nautoridade. Mais tarde, quando crescemos, temos outras pessoas ou organizações que representam\n\nisso para nós, tais como os professores, os empregadores e o governo, mas a forma de lidar com a\n\nautoridade fica muito cristalizada deste contacto inicial com os pais. Saber a posição que o\n\ncidadão tem em relação à autoridade parental é, pois, muito próximo de conhecer a sua posição\n\nface à autoridade em geral.\n\nNo gráfico, está representada a percentagem de entrevistados que concordou que os pais\n\ndevem ser amados e obedecidos independentemente das suas qualidades ou defeitos e os que\n\nacham que esse mesmo amor e respeito devem ser merecidos.\n\n128\n\nGráfico nº 9 - Relação do cidadão com os pais (figuras de autoridade)\n\nBase: Total de 19 204 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nSão visíveis as diferenças entre Portugal e o resto dos países escolhidos. Alemanha e Grâ Bretanha começam, em 1990, com cerca de 68% e 69% da população, respectivamente, a\n\nconsiderar que se deve obedecer aos pais. Espanha também dá sinais de uma forte obediência\n\nperante os pais/autoridade (82% em 1990), mas ainda abaixo de Portugal. Um facto interessante é\n\nque esta postura dogmática em relação à autoridade tem sofrido alguma erosão, nas últimas duas\n\ndécadas, em todos os países, excepto em Portugal, onde até aumentou! Em 2008, apenas 15% dos\n\nentrevistados portugueses afirmaram acreditar que, para se ter autoridade, é preciso merecê-la.\n\n129\n\nGráfico nº 10 – Aspectos importantes a incluir na educação: obediência\n\nBase: Total de 20 584 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nNo segundo gráfico desta secção, está representada a proporção de entrevistados que defende\n\nque a obediência é uma característica importante a incluir na educação das crianças. Esta\n\npergunta foi realizada mediante várias outras características passíveis de serem incluídas ou\n\nconsideradas relevantes na educação de uma criança, isto é, as boas maneiras, o empenho, a\n\nhonestidade, a paciência, a perseverança, a fé religiosa, a responsabilidade ou o auto-controlo,\n\npara nomear apenas alguns. São 18 aspectos, ao todo. Neste caso, foi escolhida a obediência pela\n\nsua clara relação com a deferência à autoridade. Crianças cujos pais acham importante incutir a\n\nobediência, serão, provavelmente, mais tementes à autoridade. É interessante ver o afastamento\n\ndos outros países em relação à Alemanha, o que poderá indicar uma perda de relevância desta\n\ncomponente na educação. Os pais alemães parecem relegar a obediência a um lugar secundário.\n\nPara eles, ser obediente não parece ser uma característica desejável no seu filho quando for\n\nadulto. Em 2008, apenas um décimo dos alemães achava isso importante. A Grã-Bretanha\n\nmanteve-se sem grande variação ao longo das duas décadas, a um nível pouco acima dos 40% da\n\npopulação. Ambos Espanha e Portugal, os dois países que mais valorizam a obediência, mostram\n\n130\n\numa tendência decrescente, apesar da evolução portuguesa ser mais suave. Em 2008, os seus\n\nvalores eram muito próximos, 29.8% para Portugal e 29.1% para Espanha e indiciavam que a\n\nobediência continuará a perder peso na educação das crianças.\n\nGráfico nº 11 – relação com a autoridade no emprego\n\nBase: Total de 20 234 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nFinalmente, na vida adulta, a obediência aos pais já não é um factor tão relevante. Nesta\n\naltura, as situações mais comuns a que os indivíduos estão expostos em que existe uma hierarquia\n\ne em que são subalternos a qualquer outra pessoa ou entidade são no seu emprego, onde têm de\n\ncumprir regras e ordens, ou como cidadão de um país, onde devem cumprir as leis. Para tentar\n\nmedir a deferência à autoridade, o gráfico acima demonstra a quantidade de entrevistados que diz,\n\n131\n\nno emprego, seguir as instruções à risca sem as questionar, o que é um sinal de um traço\n\nmaterialista ou necessitar de uma boa explicação para seguir essa conduta, um traço típico pós materialista. O que acontece é que, na mentalidade pós-materialista, o indivíduo funciona mais\n\ncom cenouras do que com paus, isto é, é mais passível de fazer algo por inspiração do que por\n\nobrigação. Por esse motivo, é difícil coagi-lo a algo sem que ele compreenda o porquê desse\n\nempreendimento. Tem de fazer sentido para o pós-materialista. Com efeito, pode observar-se no\n\ngráfico que a proporção de pessoas que segue instruções no emprego cegamente é ainda\n\nsignificativa, mas em declínio em todos os países escolhidos. Espanha teve um ligeiro aumento\n\nnos anos 90 (36.9% em 1999), mas, em 2008 (28.3%), o nível era mais reduzido que o inicial de\n\n1990 (31.9%). Este país teve, sempre ao longo dos três momentos de medida, a sua proporção de\n\nrespostas “tem de ser convencido” mais elevada do que “segue instruções”. Portugal,\n\nsimilarmente, apenas contrariou essa tendência em 1990, mas sofreu um despontar de rebeldia em\n\n1999 e 2008. Parece que, ao contrário do que seria de esperar, a obediência no emprego é algo\n\nainda bastante enraizado na Alemanha. A variação mais notória foi no crescimento da proporção\n\nde entrevistados a responder “depende”, ou seja, mostram mais flexibilidade, mas ainda com um\n\nmisto de deferência. Na Grã-Bretanha, o número de inquiridos que “segue instruções” parece\n\nseguir uma rota descendente, que foi, no entanto, contrabalançado por um aumento nos que\n\nacham que “depende” ao invés dos que “precisam de ser convencidos”, deixando antever alguma\n\nrelutância na mudança de atitude face à autoridade. Portugal e Espanha são, no último momento\n\nmedido, os únicos dois países cujo número de inquiridos que questionam as regras ultrapassa\n\naqueles que dizem segui-las sem perguntas.\n\n132\n\nv. Tradição versus Individualidade\n\nOs materialistas destacam-se por serem apegados à tradição. Como resultado, costumam\n\nmostrar resistência em relação ao que seja novo ou diferente. Os pós-materialistas, por outro lado,\n\nvalorizam a expressão pessoal, a necessidade de ser a sua própria pessoa, acima do compromisso\n\nem manter a tradição. Ser livre e fiel a si mesmo é, para eles, mais importante do que cumprir\n\ncom preceitos morais e sociais que foram herdados das gerações anteriores. Sociedades pós materialistas têm, pois, uma forte mobilidade social, alicerçada no mérito. Pessoas com\n\ncaracterísticas e escolhas diferentes são aceites. A diversidade é geralmente celebrada pelos pós materialistas e rejeitada pelos materialistas. Isto significa que minorias experienciam um outro\n\nlugar de acolhimento e tolerância nas sociedades pós-materialistas, ao invés da rejeição que\n\nviviam anteriormente. Isto é especialmente visível na aceitação de diferentes credos, das variadas\n\npreferências sexuais ou mesmo na defesa da igualdade de género, ainda que seja uma batalha já\n\nantiga.\n\nGráfico nº 12 – Tolerância dos cidadãos à diferença/novidade\n\nBase: Total de 20 152 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\n133\n\nUma forma interessante e reveladora de analisar a abertura das populações destes países à\n\ndiferença ou à diversidade é ver que tipo de pessoa toleraria como seu vizinho, isto é, como seu\n\npróximo. No caso do gráfico 8, a pergunta é sobre ter ou não homossexuais como vizinhos.\n\nPortugal regista o nível mais elevado de desagrado, demonstrando uma menor tolerância que os\n\noutros países para as pessoas com preferências sexuais diferentes. No entanto, este sofreu uma\n\nredução em pouco mais de metade na década de 90 (de 52.4% em 1990 para 25.6% em 1999) e,\n\napesar de um ligeiro aumento na década seguinte (27.7% em 2008), continua a representar uma\n\nminoria da população. Com a Alemanha, aconteceu algo parecido. Sofreu uma quebra drástica\n\nnos anos 90 (de 33.8% para 14%) e um aumento ligeiro nos anos 2000 (17.1% em 2008). A\n\nEspanha e a Grã-Bretanha mostram-se os mais abertos neste sentido. Esta última passou de\n\nsensivelmente um terço da população em 1990 que afirmou não gostar de ter homossexuais como\n\nvizinhos para apenas um décimo em 2008. Espanha é a campeã da tolerância sexual, com um\n\nnível de 30.8% em 1990 e apenas 5.4% (uma vigésima parte da população!) em 2008. Em geral,\n\ntodos os países têm actualmente valores baixos de intolerância a este aspecto, no entanto será\n\nnecessário mais algum tempo para ter mais certeza quanto à evolução em Portugal e na Grã Bretanha.\n\nGráfico nº 13 – Aspectos importantes a incluir na educação: tolerância e respeito\n\n134\n\nBase: Total de 20 590 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nOutra forma eficaz de testar a abertura de uma sociedade é ver quais os valores que escolhe\n\nincutir às suas crianças. O gráfico acima representa a relevância que, dentro de uma lista de vários\n\nvalores diferentes, a “tolerância” e o “respeito” têm na educação dos mais novos. Observa-se que\n\ntem um peso significativo em todos os países. Apesar disso, Portugal revela os valores mais\n\nbaixos e sem alteração de maior nas duas décadas analisadas. Espanha e Grã-Bretanha, mais uma\n\nvez, competem pelo lugar de mais tolerantes. A Alemanha aparece numa posição intermédia\n\nneste grupo e com uma quebra muito ligeira, mas continua a ser um nível elevado de peso dado à\n\ntolerância e ao respeito na educação.\n\nvi. Ecologia\n\nConceber o Outro como seu semelhante e não como uma ameaça ajuda a alimentar a\n\nconfiança e a ter uma noção mais aprimorada dos benefícios e da necessidade de cooperação. Por\n\nisso, o pós-materialista tem tendência a estar mais envolvido com a sua comunidade e a participar\n\nactivamente na resolução dos seus problemas. A responsabilidade social é parte integrante da sua\n\npostura. Cada é livre de escolher a sua causa, mas o importante é que se envolva na luta pelo que\n\nacredita. Isto é especialmente evidente na luta pela preservação ambiental. A preocupação\n\necológica é, pois, uma característica muito reveladora deste espírito. Dalton, no seu livro, refere\n\nmuitas vezes que uma boa forma de assessar esta transformação seria ver até que ponto os\n\nindivíduos estão dispostos a sacrificar o seu próprio rendimento para garantir que a Natureza é\n\npreservada. Isto denota claramente uma perda da prioridade do dinheiro ou bens materiais em\n\n135\n\ndetrimento do cuidado com a preservação dos recursos naturais, um valor comum a todos, que,\n\npela falta de sentido de comunidade, sai muitas vezes prejudicado nos dias de hoje. O pós materialista percebe que este problema é mais grave e mais complexo do que ter uma vida\n\nmaterialmente cómoda e que se estende além-fronteiras, necessitando do contributo pessoal de\n\nmuitos.\n\nGráfico nº 14 – Sentimento ecológico dos cidadãos\n\nBase: Total de 19 119 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study108\n\nEstes resultados contrariam as teorias de Dalton discutidas no capitulo anteriorte. Em vez\n\nunde se observar um aumento na predisposição para abdicar de rendimento em prol da\n\npreservação ambiental, essa mentalidade parece recuar e manifestar-se mais em países\n\nconsiderados menos pós-materialistas. Resta saber que motivações estão por detrás destas\n\n108\n\nOs valores apresentados resultam da soma do número de respostas “strongly agree” com as “agree”, de modo a representarem o volume de entrevistados que, de alguma forma, concordam com esta posição.\n\n136\n\nposições. Inglehart fala de um possível recuo derivado de uma crise económica mais ou menos\n\ngrave. O ano de 2008 foi o último de medida no EVS e coincide com o contágio da crise\n\nfinanceira americana na Europa. No entanto, não há ainda dados disponíveis que possam\n\nesclarecer o desenrolar das opiniões depois de esta se instalar e se revelarem as suas repercussões\n\nmais graves (como é exemplo do plano de recuperação financeira de Portugal). De facto, pode\n\nobservar-se a Alemanha, em 1990, a registar o valor mais baixo de pessoas dispostas a ter menos\n\nrendimento pela garantia de preocupação ecológica e Portugal a liderar. Ao longo das duas\n\ndécadas de observação, em todos os países, a proporção de entrevistados com esta característica\n\npós-materialista diminuiu consecutivamente. Em 2008, apenas em Espanha esta proporção\n\nconstituía uma maioria (57.1%). Portugal estava muito perto (48.9%), bem como a Grã-Bretanha\n\n(46.7%). A Alemanha, a fechar, tinha pouco mais do que um terço (34.4%).\n\nvii. Nacionalismo versus Internacionalismo\n\nOs materialistas têm, usualmente, um forte sentido nacional. Quando posto em causa,\n\npõem o seu país e o seu povo acima dos demais. Como têm tendência a desconfiar do que é\n\ndiferente, mostram chauvinismo face a outras culturas ou nacionalidades. Os pós-materialistas,\n\npor outro lado, produto da globalização, são mais internacionalistas. Consideram-se cidadãos do\n\nmundo e concebem a sua cultura como parte de um todo que constitui a espécie humana. As\n\nfronteiras e a soberania nacional, ou a vantagem sobre outros países, perdem relevo perante esta\n\nvisão do mundo.\n\n137\n\nGráfico nº 15 – Sentimento dos cidadãos em relação à sua identidade nacional\n\nBase: Total de 19 183 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study109\n\nEm geral, todos estes países revelam um alto índice de orgulho nacional, tendo a maioria\n\nda população como adepta. Não obstante, estes dados confirmam a tendência pós-materialista que\n\ngrassa na Alemanha. Dos países neste lote, é o que se mostra menos nacionalista. Há que\n\nconsiderar, no entanto, que, historicamente, sofreu grandes desilusões com o nacionalismo\n\nexacerbado, pelo que pode ter fomentado um desejo de afastamento de ideais ou valores com\n\ngrande peso nacionalista. Portugal, pelo contrário, é o que se mostra mais abertamente orgulhoso.\n\nEspanha e Grã-Bretanha ficam-se pelos lugares intermédios, apesar de em níveis acima dos 80%.\n\nAs nacionalidades parecem estar ainda consideravelmente enraizadas nestes países europeus.\n\nPorém, analisar o orgulho nacional isolado é pouco conclusivo, pelo que há que contrapôr\n\ncom outras camadas de pertença. A União Europeia, por exemplo, prevê um nível significativo de\n\ncooperação entre os Estados-membros. Para manter a paz e conseguir afirmar-se como uma\n\n109\n\nOs valores apresentados resultam da soma do número de respostas “very proud” com as “quite proud”, de modo a representarem o volume de entrevistados que sentem orgulho na sua nacionalidade.\n\n138\n\npotência regional no mundo, a UE precisa de ter cidadãos europeus próximos entre si e que\n\ntenham também uma identidade/cidadania europeia. Ver o estado desta última pode ajudar a ver\n\nse a abrangência do nacionalismo, apesar de forte, traduz-se numa parte de uma identidade com\n\nvárias escalas, em que se inclui o sentimento europeu (ou o esbatimento das fronteiras nacionais,\n\ncomo se quer aqui descobrir) ou mantém-se como primeira e única identidade destes cidadãos.\n\nIsto pode fazer-se à escala local, regional, nacional, europeia e até planetária.\n\nGráfico nº 16 – Relação dos cidadãos com os seus contextos\n\nBase: Total de 18 974 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study110\n\nNo gráfico, temos essa informação. Os entrevistados foram questionados sobre o nível\n\ncom que se identificavam mais (entre a sua localidade, a sua região dentro do país, o seu país, a\n\n110\n\nOs valores referentes à Alemanha, em 1990, são recolhidos apenas no lado da República Federal da Alemanha (RFA), na altura, ainda separada da RDA.\n\n139\n\nEuropa e o mundo). Todos demonstram grande afinidade com a sua localidade, acima dos outros\n\ncontextos. Apenas Portugal constituiu uma excepção, em 1990, ao nomear o país como mais\n\nimportante. Entretanto, a localidade reafirmou-se entre os portugueses. O que interessa mais é\n\nanalisar os níveis supranacionais, onde é considerado mais difícil manter uma relação harmoniosa\n\ncom o Outro e/ou conceber como sítio de pertença. As populações dos países aqui representadas\n\nparecem sentir-se muito pouco europeias. A Alemanha começou muito bem em 1990, mas\n\npresentemente acompanha os outros estados-membros. Por outro lado, digno de nota é a\n\nidentidade mundial revelar-se mais preponderante que a europeia. De facto, parece que existe\n\numa porção de entrevistados que se consideram cidadãos do mundo antes de qualquer outra coisa.\n\nA sua evolução futura não parece muito optimista (apenas em Espanha esta proporção aumenta\n\nconsecutivamente), mas há que esperar para ver.\n\nviii. Percepção do Outro\n\nAs sociedades tradicionais são, geralmente mais fechadas. São, geralmente, mais avessas\n\nà novidade e à diversidade. Isto radica num receio e desconfiança em relação ao Outro. Valores\n\nou opiniões fora da norma são, geralmente, rejeitadas ou desconsideradas. Os materialistas estão\n\nmarcados pela insegurança quanto ao seu acesso a recursos. Tiveram a sua sorte incerta e, por\n\nisso, o Outro é percepcionado como uma ameaça à sobrevivência do indivíduo ou grupo em\n\nquestão. Em última análise, sociedades tradicionais costumam ter baixos níveis de confiança entre\n\nos seus indivíduos. Mais uma vez, no outro lado do espectro, as sociedades pós-materialistas\n\ndemonstram um comportamento oposto. Como a sua sobrevivência estava assegurada, a\n\ndiversidade é bem-vinda e o Outro não é percepcionado como uma ameaça ou competição no\n\nacesso a recursos. Os níveis de confiança interna destas sociedades costumam ser mais elevados.\n\n140\n\nGráfico nº 17 – Nível de confiança dentro de uma sociedade\n\nBase: Total de 19 414 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study111\n\nPara tentar perceber qual é o caso nos países escolhidos, apresenta-se um gráfico que\n\nrepresenta a proporção de entrevistados (cidadãos) que afirma não confiar na maioria das pessoas.\n\nAs sociedades retratadas dão evidências de terem níveis de confiança baixos. Em todos, a maioria\n\nda população mostra-se relutante em confiar nas outras pessoas. Portugal lidera estes valores,\n\ncom mais de 80% das pessoas, na maior parte do tempo estudado, a confessar não confiar nos\n\ndemais. Parece seguir uma tendência decrescente no presente, mas será necessário mais dados\n\nque corroborem esta ideia. A Grã-Bretanha, que começou, em 1990, com o valor mínimo de\n\n56,3%, viu a desconfiança aumentar em 1999 (71,1%) e voltar a 59,7%, o valor mais reduzido de\n\n111\n\nOs valores apresentados resultam da soma do número de respostas “very proud” com as “quite proud”, de modo a representarem o volume de entrevistados que sentem orgulho na sua nacionalidade.\n\n141\n\n2008, de entre os quatro países. Alemanha e Espanha percorreram um caminho semelhante, mas\n\ntambém é difícil perceber qual será a sua evolução.\n\nix. Sociedade Civil\n\nUm dos traços mais relevantes do pós-materialismo para esta dissertação é o facto de a\n\nsociedade civil resultante desta mentalidade ser uma bastante dinâmica. O pós-materialista tem\n\num grande sentido de comunidade e, graças a isso, almeja participar activamente na sua\n\nconstrução e preservação. Na política, costuma ser mais interessado e mais sofisticado que o\n\nmaterialista. É mais educado, o que lhe permite acompanhar e compreender melhor o desenrolar\n\ndos acontecimentos na cena política. Como não tem muita deferência perante a autoridade, não\n\ntem receio em declarar as suas intenções e opiniões. Assim, as sociedades civis onde prolifera o\n\npós-materialismo são marcadamente mais poderosas dentro da democracia, tendo voz e estando\n\nmais envolvidas no destino do seu país. As sociedades de cariz materialista, no outro lado da\n\nmoeda, costumam ser mais despolitizadas e deixar a política nas mãos das elites. Existe, em\n\nregra, um fosso de compreensão e de interesse entre as elites e o público em geral, o que deriva\n\nna alienação política de uma grande fatia (muitas vezes, a maioria) da população.\n\n142\n\nGráfico nº 18 - Importância da política na vida do cidadão\n\nBase: Total de 20 389 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study112\n\nPode ver-se, no gráfico acima, os entrevistados para quem a política é importante nas suas\n\nvidas. A Alemanha liderou estes resultados até, sensivelmente, a meio dos anos 2000. Depois, foi\n\nultrapassada pela Grã-Bretanha. Portugal e Espanha são os que se mostram menos interessados,\n\nmas estão a sofrer evoluções em direcções diferentes. A de Espanha parece positiva e a de\n\nPortugal, negativa. Houve uma pequena convergência dos países, com a Alemanha e Grã Bretanha a verem a importância da política a diminuir e, em Portugal e Espanha, a aumentar.\n\nTodavia, nenhum dos países atinge os 50%. Isto significa que seguir a política é importante para\n\nmenos de metade da população dos quatro países escolhidos. As prospectivas futuras parecem\n\nbeneficiar a Grã-Bretanha e Espanha, enquanto a Alemanha traça um caminho mais duvidoso e\n\nPortugal vai em rota descendente.\n\n112\n\nOs valores apresentados resultam da soma do número de respostas “very important” com as “quite important”, de modo a representarem o volume de entrevistados que acham que a política é relevante nas suas vidas.\n\n143\n\nGráfico nº 19 – Grau de participação/envolvimento da população em associações ou organizações da sociedade civil\n\nBase: Total de 20 656 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nAqui, a lógica da análise é inversa, efectuada pela negativa. Apesar de o questionário\n\nincluir uma série de formas de participação de e na sociedade civil passível de se estudar, aqui, e\n\npara simplificar, é mais relevante a não participação do que a participação. O gráfico figura a\n\nporção de população que se coíbe de participar em qualquer iniciativa da sociedade civil, seja a\n\naderir a uma causa, seja participando numa associação cívica. Isto signifca que estão\n\nrepresentados os nacionais de cada país que constituem a sociedade civil, mas não exercem o seu\n\ndomínio. Sublinhando as previsões, Portugal e Espanha aparecem como os que têm mais pessoas\n\nque afirmam não estar envolvidas em nenhuma actividade deste tipo. Espanha foi alvo de uma\n\nligeira quebra em 1999, ou seja, um aumento da participação geral. Em 2008, nos dois países,\n\ncerca de 4/5 das pessoas não se mostraram interessadas em fazer parte integrante de uma\n\nsociedade civil dinâmica. A Alemanha, em 1990, tinha sinais muito positivos no campo pós materialista, rondando um pouco acima de 1/5 da população (26.4%) que não incorria em\n\nnenhuma actividade cívica. Com o passar do tempo, esta tendência inverteu-se e, em 2008, esta\n\n144\n\nproporção chegava quase aos 3/5 (57.5%). A Grã-Bretanha foi a única a manifestar uma melhoria\n\nneste departamento.\n\nSeguidamente, estão dispostos cinco gráficos, todos referentes ao envolvimento político\n\nda sociedade civil, especificando, em cada um, as formas variadas de o fazer. Isto é feito com o\n\nintuito de perceber quais os moldes da participação destas sociedades e ver se coincidem ou não\n\ncom os preceitos pós-materialistas.\n\nGráfico nº 20 – Participação política da sociedade civil: petição\n\nBase: Total de 19 314 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nA petição é considerada um elemento valioso e um marco de relevo na abertura das\n\ninstituições ao público. É a forma mais directa que o eleitorado tem de se fazer ouvir e, por isso,\n\nconsiderado um porta-estandarte do comportamento típico pós-materialista, que procura vias de\n\nparticipação mais inequívocas e eficazes. A Alemanha e a Grã-Bretanha são os países onde as\n\npessoas mais assinam petições. O número de cidadãos que incorreu nesta acção diminuiu um\n\npouco em ambos, apesar de não de linearmente. Mesmo assim, essa perda foi largamente\n\ntransferida para “Pode vir a assinar”, pelo que se pode afirmar que parecem países dados à\n\n145\n\nparticipação em petições. Muito pelo contrário, em Portugal, estas últimas parecem não ter grande\n\npopularidade. A proporção de “Nunca assinaria” não parou de aumentar no tempo estudado,\n\ntendo o valor mais alto de todos em 2008, que corresponde a quase metade da população (47%).\n\nEspanha viu o seu número de assinantes de petições aumentar, mas o seu peso no todo da\n\npopulação é ainda modesto.\n\nGráfico nº 21.1 - Participação política da sociedade civil: boicote\n\nBase: Total de 18 638 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nOutra forma de fazer conhecer a sua vontade é através dos boicotes. Eles são uma forma\n\nmenos tradicional de fazer passar o descontentamento. O seu carácter alternativo torna o boicote\n\numa acção relativamente popular entre pós-materialistas. Os níveis de participação em boicotes\n\nnos quatro países são muito reduzidos. A sociedade civil que mais se mobiliza para boicotar é a\n\nbritânica, com mais de 1/10 da população a participar. Logo de seguida, vem a Alemanha. Em\n\nambos os países, mesmo tendo baixa adesão, têm altos índices de pessoas que afirmam “Pode vir\n\n146\n\na aderir”. Em 1999, a Grã-Bretanha chegou a ter este valor mais elevado que os “Nunca aderiria”,\n\nmas foi a única vez que isso aconteceu, no tempo estudado. Em Portugal e Espanha, os boicotes\n\nnão reúnem tantos adeptos. A proporção de inquiridos que responde “Nunca aderiria” tem uma\n\ngrande vantagem relativamente às outras respostas, estando perto dos 70% em quase todos os\n\nmomentos analisados. Mesmo os entrevistados que respondem “Pode vir a assinar” são\n\nproporcionalmente menos do que os registados na Alemanha e na Grã-Bretanha. Neste campo,\n\nestes últimos parecem dar sinais de maior transformação social.\n\nGráfico nº 21.2- Participação política da sociedade civil: manifestação ordeira\n\nBase: Total de 19 379 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nNuma sociedade pós-materialista, a participação em manifestações ter-se-á- transformado\n\nnum hábito. Em vez de, como anteriormente acontecia, ser um sinal de o regime estar em perigo\n\n(ou de o descontentamento estar a atingir um estado crítico), transformou-se num bom barómetro\n\n147\n\nda opinião pública e uma forma de aliviar alguma tensão do eleitorado. Nas democracias, cada\n\nvez mais se torna sistemático e aceite manifestar-se em caso de não se concordar com alguma\n\nmedida ou se querer mudar o status-quo. Com efeito, os índices de participação são mais\n\nelevados na Alemanha. Apesar disto, a quantidade de “Pode vir a participar” ainda excede a dos\n\nque participam, e a dos que afirmam que nunca participariam não fica muito atrás. Os três grupos\n\nestão muito contrabalançados. Espanha é o segundo país onde as manifestações são mais\n\npopulares e com cada vez mais participantes. Em 2008, esses eram já mais numerosos que os das\n\noutras duas categorias. A Grã-Bretanha vem em terceiro, tendo muito poucas pessoas que\n\nescolhem manifestar-se e muitas mais a recusar participar em qualquer tipo de demonstração. Por\n\nfim, Portugal é onde a manifestação recolhe menos apoiantes e o seu número diminui\n\nprogressivamente entre 1990 e 2008. Porventura fruto da herança autoritária, pode ser\n\nconsiderado pouco socialmente aceitável emitir juízos de valor em público sobre o governo ou as\n\ninstituições. As manifestações eram proibidas até 1974 e este sentimento de desaprovação perante\n\nas mesmas pode ter ficado enraizado, ou não ter tido tempo de se desvanecer ou transformar. No\n\nentanto, ele parece até crescer. Em 2008, uns surpreendentes 58.9%, quase 3/5 dos entrevistados\n\nportugueses, afirmaram que nunca participariam de uma demonstração pública, mesmo que\n\nordeira.\n\n148\n\nGráfico nº 21.3 - Participação política da sociedade civil: manifestação não oficial\n\nBase: Total de 18 882 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nUma outra hipótese de expressão da sociedade civil é através de manifestações não\n\noficiais. Isto acontece quando as autoridades não são informadas. É uma demonstração fora dos\n\nmoldes habituais, pois carece de legitimação, ou seja, não é oficial. É importante aqui fazer a\n\ndistinção entre manifestações ordeiras e não oficiais. Os pós-materialistas apreciam formas\n\nalternativas de comunicar a sua opinião, mas têm preferência por maneiras pacíficas de o fazer.\n\nPor isso, têm, em geral, mais simpatia por manifestações ordeiras do que por não oficiais. Nos\n\ndados, vê-se que, em geral, este tipo de demonstração não é muito levado a cabo. Os níveis de\n\nrespostas “Nunca participaria”, em todos os países, são consideravelmente mais elevados do que\n\nas restantes respostas. Aqui, a Alemanha é que tem menos pessoas a participar neste tipo de\n\nmanifestações e mais a recusar terminantemente. Em Portugal, a situação é intermédia, sendo que\n\nparece acontecer cada vez menos. Em 2008, obteve a maior porção registada de pessoas que\n\n“Nunca participariam”. Espanha e Grã-Bretanha têm os valores mais elevados de participação da\n\n149\n\nsociedade civil em manifestações não oficiais, bem como de entrevistados a responder “pode vir a\n\nparticipar”. Parece que, nestes países, vigora uma cultura mais rebelde e, quiçá, truculenta.\n\nGráfico nº 21.4 - Participação política da sociedade civil: ocupações\n\nBase: Total de 18 995 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nÚltimo desta série de gráficos, o apresentado acima refere-se a uma outra, ainda mais\n\nalternativa, forma de protesto – a ocupação de imóveis ou outros espaços. Este género de\n\niniciativa tem ganho admiradores, como podemos ver pelo famoso Occupy Wall Street. Nos\n\npaíses europeus que aqui se analisam, esta não é ainda uma forma de manifestar\n\ndescontentamento de eleição. Os valores de participação em ocupações rondam os 1 e 2% nos\n\nquatro países, sendo que a Espanha e a Grã-Bretanha, mais uma vez, se provam um pouco mais\n\nrebeldes.\n\n150\n\nNo todo, olhando para o perfil do cidadão, é notório um misto de sinais materialistas e\n\npós-materialistas em qualquer das sociedades. No entanto, afirmar algo com veemência seria\n\nmuito prematuro. A complexidade social e valorativa não permite uma classificação peremptória,\n\nmas parece haver mais traços pós-materialistas na Alemanha, apesar de parecerem recuar um\n\npouco na primeira década e voltar lentamente a esse desenvolvimento nos anos 2000. Entre 1990\n\ne 1999, a reunificação das duas Alemanhas pode ter influenciado os resultados, com a absorção\n\nde cerca de 17 milhões de cidadãos que tinham vivido até aí sob a égide de um regime autoritário.\n\nMais informações nos próximos tempos fornecerão alguns esclarecimentos. Logo de seguida,\n\nvem a Grã-Bretanha com uma evolução pouco clara e atabalhoada. É ainda incerto o caminho que\n\ntomará. Parece haver a semente do pós-materialismo, mas que é algo contrariada. Quanto à\n\nvariável ou variáveis que exercem esta força, a forte tradição pode ser uma sugestão, mas mais\n\nestudo no assunto será necessário. Espanha e Portugal vêm na cauda do desenvolvimento pós materialista. São democracias mais novas que, contudo, mostram, já, indícios de seguirem este\n\ntrilho. Espanha parece ir um pouco à frente, com Portugal ainda muito vergado a tradições,\n\nnormas sociais e religião. A recente crise financeira ameaça atrasar esta evolução e trazer estes\n\ncidadãos de volta ao materialismo, devido à insegurança quanto à sobrevivência e ao seu acesso a\n\nrecursos.\n\n151\n\nII. O Cidadão e as Instituições Políticas\n\nNa sociedade pós-materialista, o cidadão tem uma relação paradoxal com as instituições\n\npolíticas. Ao mesmo tempo que tem um cepticismo marcado quanto à competência do serviço\n\npúblico, por outro, continua a defender a democracia e ambiciona participar nela de uma forma\n\nmais activa. Quando os materialistas estão descontentes, mais facilmente põem o regime em\n\ncausa. O pós-materialista deseja a democracia, mas é exigente perante o que esta lhe pode\n\noferecer, não se contentando com instituições que começam a dar sinais de serem incipientes ou\n\nse tornarem obsoletas.\n\nGráfico nº 22 – Participação dos cidadãos nas eleições legislativas\n\nFonte: Eurostat\n\nUma das evidências mais notórias do avanço do pós-materialismo reside nas baixas taxas de\n\nturnout, ou seja, na reduzida quantidade relativa de eleitores que exercem efectivamente o seu\n\n152\n\ndireito de voto. A abstenção pode ser uma maneira de comunicar descontentamento e frustração\n\npara com a classe política. A postura pós-materialista é de que o voto não é suficiente para se\n\ntraduzir numa participação política eficaz. As eleições constituem ainda o meio de participação\n\npolítica de excelência na democracia e são a forma mais directa disponível de interferir com\n\nquem ocupa os cargos políticos. No entanto, isto que funcionou durante muitos anos, começa a\n\nparecer insuficiente para os novos eleitores. Eles acham que escolher os governantes a cada 4/5\n\nanos não é suficiente e promove ainda muita distância (não desejável) entre a classe política a o\n\neleitorado. Os partidos estão lá no alto e escolhem as suas listas internamente, um processo que\n\nem grande parte decorre a portas fechadas e muito distante do cidadão comum. Para não falar do\n\nintervalo de tempo entre eleições em que estes cidadãos sentem que não têm meios (ou poucos)\n\npara fazer valer as suas opiniões aos governantes que elegeram em primeiro lugar. Como\n\nresultado, estes cidadãos têm tendência a olhar as eleições com crescente cepticismo e alguns\n\ndeles, apesar de reconhecerem a sua importância, por vezes, afastam-se um pouco e tentam\n\nformas alternativas de se fazer ouvir. No gráfico, estão as taxas de turnout provenientes do\n\nEurostat, das eleições legislativas, desde 1999 a 2009. Nas primeiras eleições observadas, em\n\n1999, a realidade era muito diferente da que se observa no presente. Os quatro países registavam\n\ngrandes diferenças entre si. A Espanha dominava todos os outros, com 63.1% dos eleitores\n\nregistados a irem votar. Depois, a Alemanha e Portugal na faixa entre os 40% e os 50% e,\n\nfinalmente, o Reino Unido com o eleitorado mais abstencionista. É curioso a Alemanha estar\n\npróxima de Portugal, pois a primeira tem historicamente uma participação elevada nas eleições e\n\no segundo, exactamente o contrário. A despolitização da sociedade levada a cabo no Estado Novo\n\ndesacreditou muito este processo e permanece no seio dos portugueses um misto de um certo\n\ndesinteresse, por um lado, e cepticismo, por outro, em relação à sua influência real nas pessoas\n\neleitas. Na Alemanha, o que se observa pode ser já o processo de diminuição do turnout em\n\nmarcha que Dalton menciona. Na época de eleições seguintes, em 2004, os valores dos quatro\n\nconvergiram sem, no entanto, alterarem as suas posições relativas, isto é, uma quebra acentuada\n\n153\n\nna Espanha, descidas ligeiras na Alemanha e em Portugal e uma melhoria bastante acentuada no\n\nReino Unido. Em 2009, os valores não se alteram muito. Apenas se registou uma descida ligeira\n\nem Portugal, Espanha e com especial incidência no Reino Unido, dando conta de uma diminuição\n\nprogressiva da participação nas eleições na maioria dos países estudados. Somente a Alemanha\n\nobteve um aumento muito incremental de 0.3 pontos percentuais.\n\nGráfico nº 23 – Grau de satisfação dos cidadãos com a forma como funciona o seu regime\n\ndemocrático\n\nBase: Total de 19 732 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: Eurobarómetro\n\nTodavia, a análise da taxa de turnout isolada tem as suas limitações. Conjugar o grau de\n\nsatisfação com a democracia ajuda a dar uma imagem mais completa. Aqui, está disposto o\n\nvolume de respostas “Pouco satisfeito” e “Nada satisfeito” com a maneira como a democracia se\n\ndesenrola no seu país. Analisando nesta perspectiva, Portugal e Espanha são, de longe, os países\n\nque mais duvidam da eficácia da democracia. O sentimento de desilusão seguiu uma rota\n\nascendente em Portugal na primeira década analisada, que se acentuou bastante no período\n\n154\n\nseguinte entre 2009 (57%) e 2013 (85%), representando um aumento em 1/3. Espanha teve uma\n\nprogressão diferente na primeira década, reunindo mais simpatizantes até 2004. Contudo, no\n\nperíodo entre 2004 e 2013, a satisfação com a democracia entre os espanhóis sofreu uma quebra\n\nde 45%. Ambos parecem reflectir as dificuldades advindas da crise financeira que assolou estes\n\npaíses de forma mais intensa que os seus parceiros europeus aqui presentes. Os cenários do Reino\n\nUnido e da Alemanha contam uma história diferente. Em ambos, a insatisfação só ascende acima\n\ndos 40% no Reino Unido, em 2013 (41%). Antes disso, os seus valores foram sempre\n\nrelativamente baixos, apesar de mostrarem um aumento progressivo no período estudado. Na\n\nAlemanha, o país dito mais pós-materialista, as baixas taxas de turnout não são acompanhadas\n\npelo descontentamento com a democracia, evidenciando uma noção de que os dois são\n\nfenómenos relacionados, mas cujo desempenho deve ser avaliado separadamente. A Alemanha\n\nconstitui o único país deste lote onde a satisfação com a democracia, na realidade, aumenta.\n\nGráfico nº 24 – Grau de concordância com a afirmação “A democracia é o melhor tipo de regime político.”\n\nBase: Total de 10 844 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: European Values Study\n\nOs pós-materialistas têm reservas relativamente ao efeito concreto da sua participação nas\n\neleições, mas não negam que é em democracia que almejam viver. Não desejariam outro tipo de\n\n155\n\nregime, que, na mesma lógica de Churchill, é o menos mau que se inventou até à data. No\n\nentanto, essa mesma democracia pode ser aprofundada para se parecer mais com uma democracia\n\nparticipativa, ao invés do actual modelo em vigor da democracia representativa. Esta pergunta\n\nque mede o grau de concordância com a afirmação “A democracia é o melhor tipo de regime\n\npolítico” foi incluída apenas a partir das vagas de 1999-2004 e 2008-2010 do EVS. Em geral,\n\nnestes quatro países, a democracia é o regime de eleição. Em Portugal e na Grã-Bretanha, no\n\nentanto, parece haver uma camada da população com mais dúvidas. A transferência que se vê em\n\nPortugal de respostas “Concordo totalmente” em 1999, para “Concordo” em 2008 coincide com a\n\ninsatisfação registada no gráfico anterior, o que pode incluir a forma como a própria democracia\n\nfunciona, confirmando que ainda existe alguma tendência a confundir o regime com o\n\ndesempenho das instituições, bem como a herança autoritária que ainda grassa nestes contextos.\n\nOs ingleses mostram-se muito cépticos relativamente ao seu regime. Alemanha revela uma\n\naceitação ampla da democracia como o primeiro regime desejado, mas com mais reservas em\n\n2008 do que em 1999. Espanha mostra a evolução mais positiva neste sentimento.\n\nGráfico nº 25.1 – Grau de confiança dos cidadãos no Parlamento 1990-2008\n\nBase: Total de 19 802 entrevistados.; Fonte: European Values Study\n\n156\n\nGráfico nº 25.2 – Grau de confiança dos cidadãos no Parlamento 2004-2013\n\nBase: Total de 14 691 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: Eurobarómetro\n\nNo que toca ao grau de confiança em relação às instituições, também pode constituir\n\nevidência de cepticismo ou descontentamento face a como funcionam ou a hermeticidade que\n\ndemonstram perante o público. Desta feita, foram utilizados dois gráficos com a mesma\n\ninformação, proveniente de duas fontes diferentes, o European Values Study e o Eurobarómetro.\n\nOs dois são complementares, uma vez que o primeiro avalia a confiança nos partidos políticos\n\nentre 1990 e 2008 e o segundo, entre 2004 e 2013113. Os dados do EVS dão conta de uma\n\n113\n\nAs vagas de recolha para o EVS começaram nos anos 80 (usa-se a partir dos anos 90 nesta dissertação) e foram até 2008, ao passo que, no Eurobarómetro, este tipo de avaliação começou no início dos anos 2000. Juntar os dois (em gráficos diferentes) permite uma análise de um período de tempo mais longa, apesar de não se tratar da mesma base de entrevistados, mas que, no entanto, dada a representatividade da amostra, pode fornecer algumas impressões transportáveis de uma fonte para a outra.\n\n157\n\nprogressão crescente entre 1990 e 2008, o que representa uma quebra da confiança no\n\nParlamento. As posições iniciais de 1990 mostram Portugal e Espanha a liderar a desconfiança,\n\ncom 61.6% e 58.1%, respectivamente, da população a responder que confia “pouco” ou “nada”\n\nno parlamento. Nos anos 90, assistiu-se a uma inversão da tendência e a Alemanha e Grã Bretanha passaram a ocupar as posições de maior desconfiança. Entre 1999 e 2008, os valores do\n\nEVS mostram uma quebra adicional na confiança em todos os países, com excepção da Espanha.\n\nNo gráfico do Eurobarómetro, pode observar-se uma certa estabilização da Alemanha perto dos\n\n50%, o Reino Unido com um nível elevado mas em quebra e Portugal e Espanha a sofrer um pico\n\nna falta de confiança no parlamento entre 2009 e 2013, com 83% e 89%, na mesma ordem.\n\nGráfico nº 26 – Grau de confiança dos cidadãos nos partidos políticos\n\nBase: Total de 14 691 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: Eurobarómetro\n\nÉ importante compreender o grau de confiança nos partidos políticos e qual a percepção\n\nque os cidadãos têm sobre os partidos. Especialmente na Alemanha e em Portugal, o sistema\n\npromove, apesar de em formas diferentes, a supremacia dos partidos na escolha dos candidatos e\n\n158\n\nno funcionamento quotidiano dos órgãos legislativos. Desta feita, não é possível analisar antes de\n\n2004, uma vez que esta pergunta não foi incluída no EVS antes de 2008. Portanto, a partir de\n\n2004, pode ver-se uma multitude de direcções tomadas nos quatro países. Alemanha, Reino\n\nUnido e Portugal mostram valores elevados de desconfiança. Espanha começa com 66% e\n\nascende ao valor mais elevado que se regista, 93% de entrevistados espanhóis que afirmam não\n\nconfiar nos partidos políticos. Entre 2009 e 2013, Portugal e Espanha são os que demonstraram\n\numa desconfiança crescente, enquanto a Alemanha e o Reino Unido seguiram a tendência\n\ninversa.\n\nGráfico nº 27 – Cidadãos em situação precária\n\nBase: Total de 9813 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: Eurobarómetro\n\nUma condição que pode ser útil analisar, apesar de não ser uma característica apontada de\n\num pós-materialista, é um ambiente seguro e estável. Será, sem dúvida, convidativo à\n\n159\n\nproliferação desta mentalidade. No gráfico acima, estão representadas a percentagem de\n\npopulação de cada país que, entre 2009 e 2013, sentiu que não poderia fazer planos a médio ou\n\nlongo-prazo, tentando sobreviver dia-a-dia. O Eurobarómetro informa que, infelizmente, a\n\nAlemanha parece ser o único país que oferece a possibilidade à sua população de obter alguma\n\nsegurança e fugir da precariedade. Desde o estalar da crise financeira, 2 em cada 3 portugueses e\n\n5 em cada 9 espanhóis admite dificuldades em planear o futuro. No Reino Unido, flutua a cerca\n\nde 1/3 da população. Na Alemanha é que a situação é mais optimista, com somente 1 em cada 7\n\ncidadãos alemães a sentir o mesmo. Isto dá provas de um ambiente em que será mais difícil que\n\nse espalhe a postura pós-materialista em Portugal e Espanha, pela incerteza na sobrevivência.\n\nGráfico nº 28 – Grau de corrupção nos países\n\nFonte: Transparency International\n\nPor fim, para complementar as informações anteriores, o índice de corrupção permite ter\n\numa noção da confiança que existe na sociedade. A corrupção, ou mesmo apenas a percepção de\n\ncorrupção intensa pode afectar de forma negativa o grau de confiança entre indivíduos, com\n\nespecial atenção às instituições políticas e à administração pública, em geral. Este índice lançado\n\n160\n\npela Transparency International descreve o nível percepcionado de corrupção num país de 1 a\n\n10, sendo que 1 sinaliza o mais corrupto e 10 o menos corrupto. Ambos Alemanha e Reino Unido\n\ntêm uma classificação que ronda os 8 pontos entre 1999 e 2013, o que denota um grau\n\nrelativamente baixo de corrupção. Portugal e Espanha ficam aquém, entre os 6 e 7 pontos, o que\n\npode se traduzir numa confiança no Outro mais instável.\n\nIII. Cidadãos e Deputados: Convergência de interesses\n\nA Assembleia da República tem empreendido consideráveis esforços para se aproximar\n\ndo seu eleitorado, especialmente desde os anos 90. Contudo, uma das maiores queixas dirigidas a\n\nesta instituição sempre foi o distanciamento entre deputados e cidadãos. É verdade que, apesar de\n\nos deputados serem, também os próprios, cidadãos, a amostra de população formada por eles não\n\né muito representativa em termos de características das mais básicas. O rácio homem-mulher tem\n\ndiminuído nos últimos tempos, mas ainda está muito acima dos sensivelmente 47.6% de homens\n\ne 52.4% de mulheres a nível nacional. Além do mais, as idades concentram-se muito entre os 40 e\n\n50 anos e a instrução escolar está muito acima da média nacional. É bom ter deputados educados,\n\nmas desde que não isso os torne desligados da realidade do seu país. Em média, também auferem\n\nmais que o português comum. Há que tentar perceber se isso e as suas ideologias mais marcadas\n\ntêm ou não impacto na sua capacidade de compreender o lado do eleitorado e defendê-lo. Estudos\n\nrecentes efectuados pelo Centro de Investigação e Estudos de Sociologia (CIES-IUL) destinam-se\n\na investigar vários aspectos de dois grupos-chave na sociedade: os cidadãos e os deputados. As\n\nrecolhas feitas entre os deputados tiveram lugar em 2009 e 2011 e as realizadas aos cidadãos\n\nforam em 2008 e 2012.\n\n161\n\nGráfico nº 29 – Possibilidades de participação dos cidadãos: Opinião dos cidadãos\n\nBase: Total de 2559 entrevistados (1350 em 2008 e 1209 em 2012).\n\nFonte: CIES-IUL\n\nGráfico nº 30 – Possibilidades de participação dos cidadãos: Opinião dos deputados\n\nBase: Total de 391 entrevistados (201 em 2009 e 190 em 2011).\n\nFonte: CIES-IUL\n\n162\n\nOs gráficos acima mostram o grau de concordância com a afirmação “Os cidadãos têm\n\namplas oportunidades para participar em decisões políticas” da parte dos cidadãos e do grupo dos\n\ndeputados. Do lado dos eleitores, parece haver a percepção de que a situação se agravou entre\n\n2008 e 2012. Do lado dos deputados, as opiniões tornaram-se mais dispersas. Existe algo em que\n\ntodos parecem concordar, que é no facto de os cidadãos não terem, efectivamente, muitas\n\noportunidades para tomar parte em decisões políticas. No entanto, as posições são mais\n\ndemarcadamente negativas entre os cidadãos. Em 2011, cerca de 30% dos deputados, somando as\n\npercentagens entre os que responderam “Concordo” e “Concordo totalmente”, achava que os\n\ncidadãos têm possibilidades de participar na política, contra apenas 15.8% dos próprios cidadãos\n\nem 2012. No lado dos que discordam, o cenário é similar. Em 2011, 56.3% dos deputados\n\nresponderam “Discordo” ou “Discordo totalmente” face a uma proporção de 68.4% cidadãos em\n\n2012.\n\nGráfico nº 31 – Influência dos interesses na criação das leis – Opinião dos cidadãos\n\nBase: Total de 2559 entrevistados (1350 em 2008 e 1209 em 2012).\n\nFonte: CIES-IUL\n\n163\n\nGráfico nº 32 - Influência dos interesses na criação das leis – Opinião dos deputados\n\nBase: Total de 391 entrevistados (201 em 2009 e 190 em 2011).\n\nFonte: CIES-IUL\n\nÀ semelhança dos anteriores, estes gráficos mostram o grau de concordância dos\n\ncidadãos (2008, 2012) e dos deputados (2009, 2011) com uma outra afirmação: “Os interesses\n\ntêm demasiada influência na criação das leis”, isto é, se as leis são formuladas com base nos\n\ngrupos de pressão que defendem interesses específicos que beneficiam somente alguns ou se são\n\nfeitas tendo em conta o aumento do bem-estar comum. Neste caso, ambos os grupos entrevistados\n\nconcordam com esta afirmação, sendo que os deputados até o fazem com mais veemência,\n\nprovavelmente por terem um maior contacto com o que de facto decorre no processo de\n\nelaboração das leis. Esta percepção degradou-se entre a primeira e a segunda recolha em ambos\n\nos grupos. Em 2012, o volume de cidadãos que responderam “Concordo totalmente” ou\n\n“Concordo” ascendeu aos 77.8%. Em 2011, o mesmo com os deputados chegou aos 76.3%.\n\nEstes questionários também procuram saber os assuntos que deputados e cidadãos acham\n\nmais urgente resolver (só não foram incluídas essas perguntas no primeiro, realizado aos cidadãos\n\n164\n\nem 2008). Neste campo, ambos os lados parecem estar em sintonia. O desemprego é o principal\n\nproblema, mencionado transversalmente entre grupos e anos. Logo de seguida, vem a crise\n\neconómica e as dificuldades que a rodeiam (défice orçamental, por exemplo). Também apontados\n\ncomo prioridade, os cidadãos referiram o mau funcionamento do sistema de saúde em 2012 e os\n\ndeputados, falhas no funcionamento do sistema político em 2009 e exclusão e desigualdades\n\nsociais em 2011, que está relacionado com a crise, mas mais numa perspectiva social.\n\nGráfico nº 33 – Funções dos deputados por ordem de importância\n\nBase: Total de 68 entrevistados.\n\nFonte: CESOP - Universidade Católica\n\nEste último gráfico resulta de uma pergunta que foi permitida à autora desta dissertação\n\nincluir num estudo levado a cabo pelo Centro de Estudos de Sondagens e Opinião (CESOP), da\n\nUniversidade Católica, respeitante ao Quadro Financeiro Europeu. Na representação, tomou-se\n\npartido somente dos segmentos de resposta “Muita importância” e “Bastante importância”, pois\n\nsão os que deixam antever as rubricas que os deputados valorizam e quão as valorizam. O\n\n165\n\nobjectivo desta pergunta prende-se com a importância que os deputados atribuem a cada uma das\n\nsuas funções. Em geral, valorizam todas estas tarefas que têm em mãos, mas consideram umas\n\nmais prementes que outras. Os três papéis mais classificados como tendo “Muita importância”\n\nsão, por ordem, “Resolver os problemas do país”, “Representar a nação” e “Controlar a actuação\n\ndo governo”. Os mais classificados com “Bastante importância” são “Elaborar leis”, “Representar\n\nos interesses do seu distrito eleitoral” e, mais uma vez, “Controlar a actuação do governo”.\n\n“Representar a nação”, tal como se esperava, reúne mais adeptos do que “Representar os\n\ninteresses do seu distrito eleitoral” devido à representação a nível nacional que os deputados têm\n\nprevisto na lei114. O aspecto menos valorizado é “Defender os interesses do seu partido” e, em\n\npenúltimo, “Elaborar orçamentos”. Estas rubricas são as menos valorizadas, mas estranhamente\n\nsão das mais presentes no panorama político português. Pelo contrário, “Controlar a actuação do\n\ngoverno”, que é o mais popular das rubricas, é também aquele que mais reforço pede na AR. A\n\nrealização de orçamentos tem sido a parte mais polémica nos últimos anos do país e a disciplina\n\npartidária, ou seja, a conivência do deputado com os interesses do seu partido é notoriamente\n\nforte em Portugal. Resta saber se estas incongruências surgem por os deputados acharem que\n\nestas funções já têm muito peso na agenda política, se responderam mais pelo politicamente\n\ncorrecto do que pela sua opinião pessoal ou se, de facto, acham isso mas não conseguiram ainda\n\npromover como peça central das responsabilidades do deputado. Portanto, resolver os problemas\n\ndo seu país e controlar a acção do governo parecem ser as funções que recebem maior destaque\n\ndos membros do parlamento. As funções de defender os interesses do seu partido e contribuir\n\npara a elaboração de orçamentos são os menos mencionados.\n\n114\n\nArtigo 1º do Estatuto dos Deputados.\n\n166\n\nCapítulo 4. Considerações finais\n\nO pós-materialismo é um fenómeno que tem atraído atenção nas democracias\n\nestabelecidas dos países industrializados. Advoga uma mentalidade de desvalorização dos bens\n\nmateriais, e uma valorização da individualidade e liberdade. Opõe-se ao materialismo, em que o\n\nbem-estar material é o mais importante. O crescimento económico, desempenha um papel neste\n\ndesenvolvimento valorativo. No nível inicial de sobrevivência, algum crescimento económico faz\n\numa diferença incremental na forma como a vida é percepcionada e valorizada pelos demais. No\n\nentanto, à medida que se vai ficando mais economicamente confortável, esse ganho extra\n\nproveniente do crescimento económico vai se tornando cada vez mais irrelevante. Nesse estado,\n\natinge-se uma espécie de planalto de bem-estar (plateau) em que se passa a desenvolver outras\n\ncapacidades e outros interesses, como se pode observar essa menor importância dada aos bens\n\nmateriais e maior aos valores mais abstractos. Isto traz novas potencialidades para a democracia e\n\na participação da população no processo político. Nos anos 70, Inglehart escreveu sobre\n\nmudanças a efectuar-se nas sociedades dos países industrializados, em particular nos seus valores:\n\n“ (...) a apologia da participação e da intervenção política dos cidadãos, assim como para a\n\npromoção de mecanismos e adopção de procedimentos de aproximação dos centros de poder\n\npolítico, ou ainda para a defesa da melhoria do funcionamento democrático das instituições\n\npolíticas” (Inglehart, 2008, pág. 131). O eleitorado destes países é cada vez mais educado e\n\ninformado, de rendimento de classe média e concentra-se em centros urbanos. A maior\n\nsofisticação do público traz, consequentemente, maiores exigências à elite política. As\n\ninstituições políticas provam-se insuficientes para fazer face a expectativas elevadas de\n\ntransparência, comunicação e proximidade. Os meios de participação cívica mais tradicionais\n\n(através de sindicatos ou de grupos religiosos) continuam a ser utilizados, mas perdem força face\n\na novos movimentos sociais locais ou até globais, que usufruem das novas tecnologias para criar\n\n167\n\numa base de apoio popular independente. “A emancipação por que lutam [os NMS] não é\n\npolítica mas antes pessoal, social e cultural. As lutas em que se traduzem pautam-se por formas\n\norganizativas (democracia participativa) diferentes das que presidiram às lutas pela cidadania\n\n(democracia representativa).” (Santos, 1991, pág. 167). É uma luta política, mas para surtir\n\nefeitos no quotidiano. O protesto generalizou-se como expressão de descontentamento, mas\n\nassumiu novas formas, como é o caso do crescimento do número de petições nos parlamentos\n\ndestes países. Dalton apelidou esta postura de Nova Política. As sociedades tradicionais têm\n\ntendência a obedecer mais à autoridade sem a questionar e, por isso, o status-quo mantém-se mais\n\nfacilmente. As sociedades pós-materialistas, por seu lado, não temem a autoridade e, dessa forma,\n\ntornam-se mais dinâmicas e inovadoras. Os pós-materialistas acreditam mais em si mesmos e na\n\nsua capacidade de contribuir positivamente para o seu meio. Sentem-se mais empowered (com\n\ncapacidade de auto-poder), o que resulta numa invalidação da obediência a ordens estatais, que\n\nnão sejam devidamente explicadas ou contrárias às suas crenças. Esta característica da menor\n\ndeferência à autoridade é muito relevante, pois denota uma disposição diferente em relação ao\n\npoder e às organizações. As hierarquias rígidas são ameaçadas neste contexto. As organizações\n\ntornam-se cada vez mais estruturas horizontais (em oposição ao que acontecia anteriormente em\n\nque havia uma hierarquia muito mais vertical), em que todos têm uma tarefa e poder de decisão.\n\nIsto faz com que os pós-materialistas não se detenham perante o que acham injusto, não se\n\nresignem facilmente e não obedeçam a preceitos que não lhes façam sentido. Esta é uma\n\noportunidade sem igual para que a decisão política seja precedida por um diálogo. Os pós materialistas ficam dificilmente satisfeitos com decisões feitas no sentido top-down. A\n\ndemocracia num cenário pós-materialista possivelmente reunirá condições para ser mais bottom up que alguma vez se concebeu. “Ainda mais surpreendentemente, tal como Inglehart e Welzel\n\n(2005) demonstram, a mudança na direcção dos valores da auto-expressão conduz a uma boa\n\n168\n\ngovernança (governance) e à expansão e florescimento das instituições democráticas.”115\n\n(Inglehart, 2008, pág. 143).\n\nEste fenómeno não se generalizou ainda por estas sociedades na sua totalidade. Há uma\n\nmistura de pessoas materialistas e pós-materialistas. Ambas as tipologias coexistem na\n\nsociedade, como também nos indivíduos, que têm muitas vezes traços dos dois perfis em si\n\nmesmos. Os dados apontam para um aumento proporcional dos pós-materialistas ao longo do\n\ntempo. No entanto, a crise financeira recente pode introduzir mais receios e precariedade na\n\npopulação, comprometendo o desenvolvimento desta mentalidade.\n\nPor isso, é bom ganhar ímpeto e alimentar essa transformação, antes que os efeitos nefastos\n\nda crise adiem a evolução destas sociedades. As atitudes de participação política mais acérrima,\n\ntipicamente pós-materialistas, contribuem para aumentar a qualidade da democracia. Esta não\n\npode melhorar verdadeiramente sem ter os cidadãos a apoiar a mudança. Podem transformar-se as\n\ninstituições, mas, sem envolver o público, não se promove uma verdadeira novidade. Este seria o\n\npróximo passo lógico no aprofundamento democrático.\n\nEspera-se, pois, uma mudança de paradigma social. Dito isto, o que se pode fazer para\n\nincentivar uma cidadania mais activa? O papel das instituições é essencial para facilitar e\n\nestimular esta participação cívica mais intensa. O parlamento, órgão legislativo e de legitimação,\n\né o que parece ser mais adequado para essa aproximação. As instituições parlamentares nunca\n\nforam tão criticadas e desacreditadas, mas também nunca foram tão abertas e activas. Leston Bandeira (2002) defende que se assiste a uma confusão do eleitorado português entre a avaliação\n\ndo parlamento com a do desempenho do governo ou da economia (programa), ou mesmo com a\n\nconfiança no sistema político. Com efeito, muitos aperfeiçoamentos se têm empreendido na AR,\n\nmas que ainda não atingiram todo o seu potencial. Portugal é uma democracia relativamente\n\n115\n\nTradução livre de “Even more strinkingly, as Inglehart and Welzel (2005) demonstrate, the shift toward selfexpression values is conducive to good governance and the spread and flourishing of democratic institutions.\n\n169\n\nrecente. Ainda pesa sobre si o legado histórico ditatorial do regime não-democratico. A AR\n\npadece de recursos escassos e do uso pouco eficiente destes. Tem muitos documentos normativos\n\ne práticas que ainda não estao muito sedimentadas, mas que já foram alteradas muitas vezes. “A\n\npreocupação de aproximação entre parlamento e cidadãos constitui, sem dúvida, um «luxo» de\n\ninstituições parlamentares democraticamente consolidadas.” (Leston-Bandeira, 2002, pág. 157).\n\nM ais acessibilidade, mais visibilidade e transparência são elementos-chave para as\n\ninstituições políticas se adaptarem à Nova Política. Em Portugal, os deputados têm ainda pouco\n\ncontacto directo com os cidadãos. Isto é, em parte, fruto do sistema eleitoral, em parte, fruto da\n\nherança do caciquismo. Houve várias discussões para se alterar o sistema eleitoral, mas sem\n\nefeito. Seria bom considerar a mudança para um sistema misto, inspirado no que os alemães\n\nfizeram, mas adaptado às condições do contexto português. Por outro lado, as trocas de favores\n\nestão enraizadas na cultura política. O caciquismo promoveu a centralização do contacto com os\n\ncidadãos. O exemplo alemão também pode servir de inspiração na cultura de proximidade que\n\nleva a cabo. No Bündestag, os partidos têm muito poder e um lugar central, mas o sistema\n\ncontinua a favorecer o contacto directo com os cidadãos. Isto é devido ao sistema eleitoral e à\n\nforma como o sistema político está disposto (corpo legal). Mais importante, existe pressão dos\n\npares! Os deputados são mal-vistos pelos outros MPs se não visitarem o seu círculo. Poderia\n\ntambém adoptar-se uma espécie de “surgery” (consultas pessoais dos deputados aos eleitores do\n\nseu círculo eleitoral). Esta prática pode ser bastante benéfica. Ajuda a auscultar os problemas dos\n\ncidadãos mais directamente, a melhorar a relação parlamento-cidadão e aumentar a auto-estima\n\nde ambos os deputados e dos cidadãos. Dos deputados, porque sentem que ajudam directamente.\n\nDos cidadãos, porque sentem que são ouvidos. Por vezes, os cidadãos nem procuram outras\n\nconsequências. Basta-lhes sentirem que o parlamento não é completamente hermético e que, se\n\nprecisarem, existe pelo menos um deputado dedicado a ouvi-los.\n\n170\n\nOs partidos, outrora principais meios de comunicar os problemas dos seus eleitores,\n\nparecem ter adquirido demasiado peso no sistema, limitando o espaço de acção dos deputados e a\n\npossibilidade de participação cívica por outras vias. Ao mesmo tempo, parecem ter ideologias\n\nmais abrangentes (e menos claras) e serem constituídos por elites cada vez mais afastadas das\n\nreais necessidades da população. A disciplina partidária é muito rígida e submete demasiado o\n\nindivíduo ao grupo. Dar mais espaço aos deputados para poderem discordar dos seus partidos e\n\ntomar decisões de acordo com a sua consciência poderá ajudar. Portugal parece ainda não ter\n\npartidos com traços pós-materialistas, pelo que há também esse vazio na cena política. Os\n\nrecentes partidos Movimento 3D e o Partido Livre, preparados para as próximas eleições\n\neuropeias, parecem providenciar essas alternativas, mas mais investigação será necessária no\n\nassunto. Quanto a uma maior profissionalização do papel de deputado, uns apoiam, defendendo\n\nque os deputados ficam mais independentes dos interesses em jogo. Outros criticam, dizendo que\n\npromove a distância entre o MP e o eleitorado, os seus problemas e aspirações. Mas, mais\n\nimportante do que a profissionalização do deputado é a “profissionalização” da condição de\n\ncidadão.\n\nDa análise comparativa, retirou-se que ambos cidadãos e deputados concordam que, em\n\nPortugal, os interesses têm demasiado peso na elaboração das leis. As petições têm aumentado,\n\nmas continuam sem grande visibilidade ou resultado concreto. Seria útil à AR criar uma\n\nComissão de Petições, complementada por um relatório anual sobre as mesmas e lançado para o\n\nconhecimento do público em geral, tal como acontece na Alemanha. Também seria de interesse\n\nconsiderar algum processo de aprovação legislativa com participação de cidadãos ou de proposta\n\nlegislativa com origem nos mesmos. O peso que a sociedade civil tem na criação legislativa é\n\nmuito desproporcional ao impacto que essa mesma legislação terá nela.\n\nO escrutínio ao governo e a outras instituições políticas, em Portugal, ainda é algo\n\ncondicionado e o público pouco tem que ver com ele. Não está muito envolvido, a não ser nas\n\n171\n\nmanifestações ou na possibilidade de ler documentos disponibilizados pelas instituições. Alguns\n\nargumentam que os eleitores é que estão (aparentemente) afastados da política, que não se\n\ninteressam e não querem participar. Mas quem participará em algo que não acredita ou em que\n\nacha que a sua opinião não terá efeito? Parece ter-se perdido um pouco do laço emocional com os\n\nparlamentos, resultando numa visão dos mesmos como algo separado e não como representantes\n\n(os mais próximos) do público que são. Van der Meer (2010) sugere que estabelecer laços\n\nemocionais com o público pode ser mais importante do que qualquer nova lei ou capacidade\n\ntécnica! Leston-Bandeira (2012) também explica que a representação simbólica tem sido\n\ndescurada na actividade parlamentar portuguesa, sendo muito importante para a identificação com\n\na instituição. A AR precisa de retomar o seu lugar como símbolo de representação popular.\n\nA aposta na cultura democrática é outra das vertentes. O nível de “analfabetismo político”\n\né exasperante. Os jovens são centrais neste aspecto. Este grupo-alvo poderá capitalizar uma\n\nalteração mais significativa na sociedade. É importante que se aprenda noções básicas políticas na\n\nescola desde uma idade precoce. É importante que se saiba discutir os assuntos, em conjunto,\n\nnuma assembleia e que se saiba negociar e fazer compromissos desde novo. A ciência política é\n\nessencial na escola, mesmo que seja integrada noutra disciplina mais ampla (como “Cidadania”,\n\npor exemplo). Os partidos costumavam constituir uma boa iniciação aos jovens, mas isso não\n\nacontece actualmente em Portugal. As juventudes partidárias são, mais do que centros de partilha\n\nde interesses e ideologias, nos dias de hoje, um banco de novos potenciais candidatos dos\n\npartidos, mas completamente subservientes. As juventudes partidárias providenciam algum treino\n\nno processo político. No entanto, não servem para ensinar como mover-se na política, em geral,\n\nmas sim, como funcionar com a ideologia do partido em questão. Ora, antes de se poder fazer\n\numa escolha informada, será necessário conhecer todos, ou, pelo menos, muitos. Essa educação\n\ntorna-se necessária cá fora, no seio da sociedade civil, antes de alguém decidir associar-se a\n\nalgum partido por outras razões que não a vocação própria. As associações cívicas são também\n\n172\n\numa boa fonte de prática e aprendizagem neste sentido, válida para qualquer idade. A proliferação\n\ndos novos movimentos sociais e o uso das novas tecnologias podem estimular a participação dos\n\njovens como membros da sociedade civil e incentivar o seu desejo por ter um papel mais\n\npreponderante. É preciso tempo e capacidade para estudar a fundo e formar uma opinião sobre os\n\nvários assuntos na agenda política. Ora, tal como Drucker (2012) menciona, a sociedade pós industrializada caminha para uma nova realidade, em que a maioria das pessoas terá educação\n\nsecundária e, uma grande porção, mais do que isso, acompanhado de uma flexibilização como\n\nnunca se viu do trabalho, ou seja, do tempo que o trabalho pago ocupa na vida das pessoas. Aqui,\n\no crescimento do voluntariado ou participação em associações cívicas também contribui, com\n\nformação nos assuntos, em si, e nos processos para os influenciar. Isto dará oportunidade ou\n\ncriará espaço para que o político entre no quotidiano de uma forma mais construtiva/produtiva.\n\nAssim, o cidadão terá oportunidade de tomar tempo para aprofundar o seu conhecimento nos\n\ntemas que lhe interessarem e tomar partido na luta pela causa ou causas que lhe são mais\n\npróximas. Os apoiantes de cada causa competirão entre si pela atenção da classe política. Claro\n\nque, no princípio, este processo pode parecer muito caótico, mas todas as mudanças passam por\n\num período de adaptação, ainda mais numa mudança estrutural. Os cidadãos seguirão uma curva\n\nde aprendizagem que levará eventualmente a um equilíbrio. Cada indivíduo na sociedade passa a\n\nser um cientista político amador, tomando em si a responsabilidade que lhe cabe pelo que\n\nacontece no seu próprio país. Existem também, hoje em dia, vácuos de poder que poderiam ser\n\npreenchidos pelo chamado empreendedorismo social. O cidadão comum, face a um problema que\n\ntenha implicações sociais mais ou menos graves e cuja resolução é evitada ou ignorada pelas\n\nautoridades, pode tomar em si ou no seu grupo a responsabilidade de criar uma solução viável\n\npara tal dificuldade.\n\nDrucker (2012) apresenta também um conceito japonês interessante – o Kaizen – que\n\npode ser aplicado ao trabalho da AR com os cidadãos. Traduz-se num processo de melhoria\n\n173\n\nconstante. Este método de trabalho é popular entre os japoneses, em que não é suficiente a\n\ninovação momentânea. Procuram-se soluções para um problema e, quando se chega a alguma,\n\nnão se fica por aí. Continua-se, sim, com uma investigação contínua para arranjar soluções cada\n\nvez melhores e mais eficientes. Este sistema de inovação contínua e sistemática permite uma\n\nevolução quase constante. Uma curiosidade é que recentes descobertas na neurologia provam que\n\no próprio cérebro funciona da mesma forma, por um aperfeiçoamento contínuo, organizado e ,\n\nde certa forma, democrático. É por isso que, quando alguma lesão cerebral acontece, é possível a\n\nrecuperação por meio do reforço ou criação de caminhos neurológicos alternativos. O conceito de\n\nparticipação cívica adoptado para a AR poderia ser similar nesse sentido. Ao longo da discussão\n\ndos vários assuntos, o público poderia dar a sua opinião aos encarregados das leis em questão.\n\nMesmo que um determinado tema tenha sido solucionado, não é fechado, dando oportunidade aos\n\ncidadãos de o revisitarem e fazerem mais sugestões ou mudarem aquilo que desejam ou acham\n\npertinente. É um trabalho contínuo, mas que poderá conferir resiliência à AR. A organização na\n\nsociedade do conhecimento tem de aprender a inovar constantemente, pois fica facilmente\n\nobsoleta. Outro conselho de Drucker para as organizações, mas que se adapta aqui ao tipo de\n\norganização específico que é a AR, é a descentralização. As organizações ficam cada vez maiores\n\ne mais complexas, precisando, por isso, de poder mais diluído para manter a sua unidade, por\n\nmais paradoxal que isto possa parecer. Cada subdivisão (comissões, por exemplo) precisa que lhe\n\nseja conferido mais poder, para que possa tomar decisões sem recorrer à estrutura centralizada.\n\nIsto ajuda a agilizar os processos em mãos. Os mecanismos mais específicos requerem mais\n\ninvestigação, mas assentariam nesta filosofia. A expressão “crowd” aparece como prefixo em\n\nvárias novas palavras, expressando a actividade partilhada. Ouve-se falar em “crowdfunding” e\n\n“crowdsourcing”. Porque não uma política decidida por todos e com origem em todos? Porque\n\nnão uma “crowdpolity”? O objectivo é a dissolução progressiva de barreiras e o reconhecimento\n\nda interdependência dos vários agentes na sociedade.\n\n174\n\nO pós-materialismo pode contribuir para a um aprofundamento da democracia. Talvez\n\nnão seja apenas uma ideia otimista. Evocam-se as palavras de Pippa Norris, quando diz que a\n\ndemocracia poderá reemergir como uma fénix das cinzas, mais forte do que alguma vez foi, com\n\nmais pessoas envolvidas, com mais diversidade e mais criatividade na resolução dos problemas\n\ndo quotidiano.\n\n175\n\nReferências bibliográficas\n\nAbramson, P.

Some authors\n\nhave argued that protest parties in this manner indirectly contribute to the stability of electoral\n\ndemocracy, functioning as ‘safety valve’ for political discontent. In this paper, we investigate\n\nthe relation between protest voting and political trust in a dynamic perspective, relying on a\n\nfive year long Belgian panel study. We confirm that citizens with low levels of political trust\n\nare more likely to vote for protest parties. Additionally, we point out that decreasing levels of\n\ntrust significantly increase the probability of voting for a protest party, even controlling for\n\nabsolute levels of trust. Most importantly, having voted for a protest party in 2009 explains a\n\nsubsequent further drop in political trust during the 2009-2014 observation period. The panel\n\nanalysis suggests that distrust and protest voting reinforce one another, leading to a potential\n\nspiral of distrust.\n\nKEYWORDS\n\nPolitical trust; spiral of distrust; change in trust; Belgian Election Panel (BEP)\n\n1\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe literature on the relation between political trust and electoral behaviour shows that\n\ndissatisfied voters are more likely to abstain from voting (Bélanger & Nadeau, 2005;\n\nHetherington, 1999; Gabriel, 2015). In a context of compulsory voting, however, abstaining is\n\nnot a valid option and in that case blank and invalid voting are strongly related to low levels\n\nof political trust (Hooghe, Marien & Pauwels, 2011). Furthermore, previous research offers\n\nconvincing evidence that some parties succeed in attracting the ‘disgruntled’ voters (Van der\n\nBrug, 2003). By voting for third parties, protest parties, extremist or populist parties, citizens\n\nhave a possibility to voice their discontent (Miller & Listhaug, 1990).\n\nThe relation between distrust and protest voting has been well established. Van der Brug and\n\nFennema (2003: 58) define protest voting as “a vote primarily cast to scare the elite that is\n\nnot policy driven”. Accordingly, a party preference that is mainly driven by distrust in\n\npolitical institutions qualifies as a protest vote. In the literature, there is more disagreement\n\nabout the long-term consequences of this form of protest voting. While most of the previous\n\nstudies have investigated the relation between political (dis)trust and voting behaviour in a\n\ncross-sectional manner, the purpose of the current study is to investigate the dynamic relation\n\nbetween trust and voting. If a protest party succeeds in gaining appeal, this might partly\n\nrestore a citizen’s faith in the electoral process. In that case, voting for an anti-establishment\n\nparty might have a positive effect on democratic legitimacy as this vote functions as a kind of\n\nsafety valve to stabilize levels of discontent. However, a number of scholars have also argued\n\nthat voting behaviour might fuel discontent, and spread negative feelings across the\n\npopulation (Rooduijn, de Lange & Van der Brug, 2014).\n\nWith respect to the relation between protest voting and distrust, different expectations emerge\n\nfrom the literature. A first expectation is that protest parties merely benefit from pre-existing\n\nattitudes of dissatisfaction and register the attitudes that are already present. A second\n\nexpectation is that protest and populist parties not only mobilize dissatisfied voters but that\n\nthey also fuel a sense of dissatisfaction in the electorate (Van der Brug, 2003). Third, it has\n\nbeen argued that particular protest parties succeed in channelling dissatisfaction and stop an\n\nover-time decline of political trust (Miller & Listhaug, 1990). The cross-sectional data that\n\nhave previously been used to shed light on this question allow speculating about the\n\ndirectionality of this link, but panel data are needed for drawing strong inferences.\n\n2\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the dynamic relation between political trust and voting behaviour\n\nby means of a panel design. This allows studying how the trust level of protest voters evolves\n\nfollowing their vote decision. We make use of the data from the Belgian Election Panel (2009 2014), in which a representative sample of voters has been surveyed in the context of both the\n\n2009 and the 2014 Belgian elections. Previous research has already shown a strong relation\n\nbetween political trust and voting for populist and extreme-right parties in Belgium (Hooghe\n\net al., 2011), rendering the Belgian context an interesting case for investigating this research\n\npuzzle on dynamic patterns as well. Furthermore, the general decline of trust in Belgium, as a\n\nresult of long political crisis (Hooghe, 2012) introduces considerable variation in our data\n\nduring the observation period.\n\nThe Belgian context consists of two separate party systems; one of Dutch-language parties\n\nand one of French-language parties. As protest parties are mainly present in the Dutch\n\nlanguage area of the country (Deschouwer et al., 2015), we expect protest voting to be present\n\nmainly in the Dutch language region of Flanders, while we expect a more diffuse pattern\n\namong Francophone voters. If voting has a subsequent effect on political trust, this effect\n\ntherefore should be limited to the Flemish region, and be absent in the French language\n\nregion.\n\nWe first review the literature on the relation between political trust and voting behaviour with\n\nspecific attention for the discussion on how attitudes not only affect vote choices, but how\n\nvote choices can affect attitudes as well. We provide more information on the Belgian\n\nelectoral context, before presenting data and methods. After discussing the results from our\n\nanalyses we add some remarks on the implications of our findings for the role of protest\n\nvoting in electoral democracy.\n\n2. POLITICAL TRUST AND VOTE CHOICES\n\nIt is by now readily accepted in the literature that levels of political trust affect voters’ party\n\npreferences. The first studies on this topic originated in the context of two-party systems and\n\nhighlighted that low levels of political trust might be beneficial for the opposition party\n\n(Citrin, 1974). When more than two candidates or parties compete for election, however,\n\n3\n\ndynamics are different. Hetherington (1999) has shown that if there is a viable third party, this\n\nparty attracts the distrusting – breaking the dominance of the two major parties in the United\n\nStates. Similarly, political distrust has been found to be an important determinant of third\n\nparty voting in the Canadian context (Bélanger & Nadeau, 2005). According to Miller and\n\nListhaug (1990), how the distrusting citizen votes depends on how flexible the party system\n\nis. If a party system is sufficiently open, protest parties can rise and attract votes among the\n\nlow trusting. In their view, this form of responsiveness could subsequently have a positive\n\neffect on the level of legitimacy of electoral politics because the disgruntled find an effective\n\ninstrument to voice their discontent.\n\nThe relation between distrust and protest voting has also been investigated in the literature\n\nthat establishes at an individual level the link between the aggregate level trends of an alleged\n\ndecline of political trust on the one hand (Hetherington, 1998; Norris, 1999) and a surge of\n\npopulist and protest parties across Western democracies on the other (Arzheimer, 2009;\n\nMudde, 2007; van Kessel, 2011). Attitudes of dissatisfaction and political distrust are indeed a\n\nrecurrent theme in research analysing the determinants of choosing protest or populist parties.\n\nA prime example is the Netherlands, where voting for the populist party List Pim Fortuyn\n\nclearly was an expression of anti-partyism, political cynicism, low levels of political efficacy\n\nand political distrust (Bélanger & Aarts, 2006; Schumacher & Rooduijn, 2013; Van der Brug,\n\n2003). Even though all these authors stress the relevance of policy positions and leader effects\n\nin voting for populist parties (either on the left or on the right), it is clear that a vote for one of\n\nthese parties is to some extent a protest vote (Ivarsflaten, 2007). Our first hypothesis is thus\n\nthat there will be a relation between distrust and protest voting:\n\nH1: There is a negative relation between levels of political trust in 2014, and the\n\nprobability of voting for protest parties.\n\nThe impact of political trust on voting behaviour is generally investigated in a static way, i.e.,\n\nthe effect of levels of trust on vote choices are looked at. A case could be made, however, for\n\ntaking into account changes in trust levels. A first reason to think so is that voters can vote in a\n\ndirectional manner (Rabinowitz & Macdonald, 1989). For political trust, what matters for\n\ntheir vote choice would then not be the overall level of trust, but how the assessment of the\n\npolitical system has changed over time. If voters have become less trusting in politics, the\n\ndirection of how their attitudes changed would lead them to choose a party mobilizing on\n\n4\n\ndistrust. Second, research in the field of economic voting shows that voters act retrospectively\n\nand take into account past performances of the incumbent (Fiorina, 1978; Lewis-Beck &\n\nStegmaier, 2013). With respect to political trust as well, voters could be retrospective and be\n\nguided by their assessment of change over an electoral cycle. Our second hypothesis therefore\n\nreads that change in political trust, rather than the absolute level of trust, would be associated\n\nwith protest voting.\n\nH2: An overtime decline in political trust, is positively related to the probability of voting\n\nfor protest parties, even controlling for absolute levels of political trust.\n\nMost research on the relation between political trust and voting for protest parties is based on\n\nsingle or repeated cross-sectional studies. Such designs provide evidence on the presence of a\n\nrelation between political trust and voting behaviour, but they do not shed light on\n\ndirectionality. In terms of the role of political parties themselves, three different perspectives\n\ncan be distinguished. First, protest parties could merely attract dissatisfied voters and offer an\n\noption for representation for the low trusting voters present in the electorate (Bélanger &\n\nAarts, 2006). As such, we would not expect any effect of protest voting on the subsequent\n\ndevelopment of political trust. Second, protest parties can – by channelling feelings of distrust\n\nwithin the electoral system – reduce political discontent, as pointed out by Miller and\n\nListhaug (1990). From a comparative analysis of the impact of trust and efficacy on voting\n\nbehaviour in the United States, Sweden and Norway, they concluded that “in the flexible\n\nmulti-party system of Norway, distrust was channelled back into the electoral arena as\n\nsupport for the opposition and protest parties of the right” (Miller & Listhaug, 1990: 382 383). The theoretical relevance of this claim is that protest voting can be considered as a\n\n‘healthy’ sign for the vitality of electoral politics. If citizens can express their distrust in the\n\nvoting booth, this might restore their faith in the electoral process. If the protest party is\n\nsuccessful, it might even moderate its party program and join a new governing coalition\n\n(Dandoy, 2014). A third, and opposite claim is that protest parties can act to ‘fuel’ political\n\ndiscontent. From his study of determinants of voting for List Pim Fortuyn (LPF) in the\n\nNetherlands Van der Brug (2003) concludes that a preference for LPF aroused discontent\n\nrather than being driven by it. Bélanger and Aarts (2006: 16), however, make use of panel data and disagree with this point of view. Their analyses lead them to stress that a ‘reservoir of\n\ndiscontent’ already existed in the Netherlands, where the LPF successfully tapped into. Still,\n\nthey as well find LPF supporters to become more cynical over time. For the Belgian case,\n\n5\n\nusing panel data Thijssen (2001) has shown that voting for the extreme-right in Flanders is\n\nassociated with a growing sense of political alienation. The causal mechanism for this effect\n\nmight be that once one has voted for a specific party, this behaviour affects a voter’s attitudes\n\nand is incorporated into the political identity of the voter (Boonen & Hooghe, 2014; Dinas,\n\n2014). As Dinas (2014) has shown with regard to the development of party identification,\n\nvoters’ attitudes can change to match more closely their previous voting behaviour.\n\nMechanisms of cognitive dissonance and self-perception help us explain why voters – perhaps\n\nunconsciously – change their attitudes and bring them in line with the attitudinal pattern that\n\nis associated with a specific political party (Dinas, 2014). This kind of causal logic is well\n\ngrounded in the social psychological literature. Cognitive dissonance theory, but also the\n\nresearch tradition on minimal group effects assumes that actors have a tendency to adapt their\n\nattitudes to their assigned or selected group identity. Self-perception theory assumes that\n\nactors actively interpret their own behaviour, and develop attitudes and preferences that are\n\ncompatible with their behaviour. Selection and adaptation mechanisms, finally, part from the\n\nnotion that individuals might self-select into a group identity or an interaction context, but\n\nlater on adapt to the prevailing value pattern within that group. So there are various social\n\npsychological traditions that argue in favour of investigating the relation from behaviour to\n\nattitudes. Applying these insights to having voted for a protest party would mean that\n\nsubsequently levels of dissatisfaction become more salient, as this offers a stronger\n\ncongruence between one’s own attitudes and the attitudinal pattern associated with this\n\nspecific party. Following this logic, we hypothesize that in the Belgian context protest parties\n\nnot only mobilize distrust, but additionally fuel distrust among their voters.\n\nH3: Citizens who voted for a protest party will subsequently become more distrusting over\n\ntime than those who did not vote for protest parties.\n\nIn sum, while it is an established fact that political distrust is associated with voting for protest\n\nparties, questions remain on the evolution of trust over time and how this is related to voting\n\nbehaviour. We address this research puzzle, because it is highly relevant for the general debate\n\nabout the effects of protest and populist parties on the stability of electoral democracy in\n\nEurope.\n\nWe investigate this relation in Belgium, as this country offers an ideal setting, both for the\n\nstudy of political trust as for the study on protest voting. Because of a system of compulsory\n\n6\n\nvoting, abstaining from voting is not a valid exit option, and therefore it can be expected that\n\nlow levels of political trust are strongly linked to voting for populist parties. In the context of\n\nthe 2009 regional elections in the Flemish region, distrusting citizens were found to have a\n\nhigher probability of voting for the populist List Dedecker (LDD), the extreme right Vlaams\n\nBelang (VB) or the Flemish nationalist party (N-VA). If we follow the definition of Van der\n\nBrug and Fennema (2003), the significant role of political distrust as a vote determinant\n\nwould qualify these parties as protest parties. It seems, therefore, that a number of parties in\n\nthe Flemish party system succeeded in “providing the disaffected with a means of\n\nrepresentation” (Miller & Listhaug, 1990: 357). It has to be noted that all these parties are\n\nactive in the Dutch language party system, while in the French language party system no\n\neffects of political trust could be documented (Hooghe et al., 2011; Pauwels, 2011). This by\n\nitself renders Belgium an interesting case for a comparison between a system with protest\n\nparties (i.e., the Dutch language party system) and a system without protest parties (i.e., the\n\nFrench language party system). If protest parties indeed “fuel” discontent, as Van der Brug\n\n(2003) has argued, this effect should be present only in the Dutch language region (Dandoy,\n\n2014).\n\nThe standard definition of a protest vote is a vote for a party that fundamentally challenges the\n\nestablished status quo of the political system (McAllister, 1982). Given the ongoing debate\n\nabout what party exactly should be considered as a protest party, we opt for a broad\n\ncomparison by investigating the vote motives for all parties (Van der Brug, Fennema & Tillie,\n\n2000; Van Spanje, 2011) and analyse the relation between political trust and each political\n\nparty. For the Flemish region, we build further on previous research that has shown that\n\nprotest voting in this party system is clearly discernible (Hooghe et al., 2011). For the 2014\n\nelections, we assume to find the same voting patterns as observed for the 2009 elections and\n\nexpect higher levels of political trust to decrease the probability of voting Vlaams Belang or\n\nN-VA.1 Interestingly, the nationalist party N-VA was considered to be the great winner of the\n\n2009 elections, gaining 13.1 per cent of the vote. The party subsequently entered the Flemish\n\nregional government, and in the Belgian federal system this is a very important power\n\nposition. The nationalists thus quickly made the transition from an anti-establishment party to\n\na governing party, and it remains to be investigated how their voters reacted to this\n\n1. List Dedecker (LDD), that obtained 7.6% of the votes in the 2009 regional elections, only ran in one electoral district in 2014 and is therefore not taken into account in the analyses predicting respondents’ 2014 vote intention.\n\n7\n\ntransformation: did they continue to develop a distrusting attitude, or did the entry of their\n\npreferred party reconcile them with the functioning of the political system in the country?\n\nBecause the regional level in Belgium has extensive authorities, we could assume that most\n\nvoters will be familiar with the distinction between the federal and the regional level and will\n\nbe knowledgeable of the fact that the N-VA was in government at the regional level. In fact,\n\nresearch on media attention for members of Parliament in Belgium shows that the regional\n\nand federal parliaments receive almost equal attention in television news broadcasts (Hooghe,\n\nJacobs & Claes, 2015). For the French language party system, by contrast, given that there is\n\nnot a clear protest party participating in the elections, we do not have a strong hypothesis on\n\nhow political trust affects voting behaviour.\n\n3.DATA AND METHODS\n\nAs we aim to shed light on the dynamic relation between political trust and protest voting, we\n\nshould have access to data about the evolution over time. Therefore, we rely on data with a\n\npanel structure for our analyses. We employ the data from the Belgian Election Panel (BEP,\n\n2009-2014), a representative survey of voters in the two main regions of Belgium (Flanders\n\nand Wallonia), based on a sample from the National Register of the citizens of Belgium. The\n\n2009 part of the panel survey consisted of three survey waves, two of which were before the\n\n2009 regional elections of 7 June 2009 and one that was in the field shortly after.2 1,698\n\nrespondents took part in this post-electoral survey wave and were interviewed by phone,\n\nwhich is 35% of the original sample (PartiRep 2009). In the run-up to the elections of 25 May\n\n2014, these respondents were contacted again to participate in the 2014 part of the panel\n\nstudy. A total of 792 respondents who took part in the 2009 wave 3-survey sent back a paper\n\nquestionnaire, which is 46.7% of the population of interest (Dassonneville, Falk Pedersen,\n\nGrieb & Hooghe, 2014). The data thus suffer from attrition, and as this is not a random\n\nphenomenon it likely biases our results (Frankel & Hillygus, 2014; Vandecasteele & Debels,\n\n2007). We partly account for attrition effects by weighting our data by socio-demographic\n\ncharacteristics. Even though the panel-data are not perfect, for the purpose of our analyses\n\nthey are to be preferred over cross-sectional surveys – as recall questions on the previous vote\n\nare known to result in large errors (van der Eijk & Niemöller, 2008).\n\n2. Post-electoral interviews took place between the end of June 2009 and the end of August 2009.\n\n8\n\nAs a measure for political trust, we use respondents’ indicated level of trust in the following\n\ninstitutions; political parties, the regional government, the regional parliament, the federal\n\ngovernment, the federal parliament and politicians. For each of these institutions, respondents\n\nreported their level of trust on a scale from 0 (no trust at all) tot 10 (complete trust). As clear\n\nfrom the results in Table 1, for Flemish and Walloon panel-respondents, both in 2009 as well\n\nas in 2014 these six items load solidly on a one-dimensional scale, which is in line with earlier\n\nresearch (Hooghe et al., 2011; Marien, 2011).3 The mean values for political trust in Table 1\n\nadditionally point out a decline in political trust between 2009 and 2014. This decline, from\n\nan average of 5.36 in 2009 to 4.84 in 2014 in the Flemish region and from 5.05 to 4.01 in\n\nWallonia, is observable for every item included, but is especially pronounced for the regional\n\ninstitutions. Even though this is a marked decline, it is unsurprising, given the major political\n\ncrisis the country went through between 2007 and 2012 (Hooghe, 2012). Other studies too,\n\nsuggest that this long lasting governmental crisis had a negative impact on political trust\n\nlevels in Belgium (Deschouwer et al., 2015). In terms of the differences between both regions,\n\nwe observe that levels of political trust are somewhat lower in the Walloon region than in the\n\nFlemish region and the decrease of political trust over the 2009-2014 electoral cycle is more\n\npronounced among Walloon respondents as well (-1.04, compared to -0.53 for Flemish\n\nrespondents).\n\nAlthough the scale is by itself one-dimensional and as such will be used in the analysis, for\n\nsome analyses we will also use a distinction between federal and regional institutions. For\n\nthese subscales only two items in each case could be used, referring to the regional or federal\n\nparliament and government respectively. The reasons for making this distinction is that the N VA in 2009 entered the regional government but not the federal government after the 2010\n\nelections (Deschouwer & Reuchamps, 2013). It could be expected that dissatisfied N-VA\n\nvoters after 2009 would develop higher levels of trust in the regional institutions, while they\n\nwould continue to lose trust in the federal institutions of Belgium.\n\n3. The one-dimensionality is stronger in 2014 than in 2009, with an Eigen value rising from 3.8 to 4.7 in Flanders and from 4.4 to 5.0 in Wallonia and Cronbach’s α rising from .88 to .95 in the Flemish region and from 0.73 to 0.83 in Wallonia.\n\n9\n\nTable 1.

Entries are average scores on a 0-10 scale. Significance: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.\n\nOur first two hypotheses deal with how trust affects voters’ electoral choices. Investigating the\n\nvote choice implies that our dependent variable has a categorical nature, distinguishing\n\nbetween different vote choice options in the 2014 elections. Therefore, we present the results\n\nof a series of multinomial logistic regression models and we examine voting in the two party\n\nsystems separately. For the Flemish region we take a vote for the Christian Democratic party\n\nCD&V as the reference category. We do so, because this is the major mainstream party. The\n\nother outcome options are a vote for the green party (Groen!), a vote for the Flemish\n\nnationalist party (N-VA), a vote for the liberal party (Open VLD), a vote for the social democrats (SP.a), a vote for the extreme-right party (Vlaams Belang), a vote for another party\n\nand a blank or invalid vote. Similarly, for the French language parties, we take a vote for the\n\nChristian Democrats (cdH) as a reference category. In the Walloon region, the other options\n\nare a vote for the green party (Ecolo), the liberals (MR), the socialists (PS), the extreme left\n\nparty (PTB Go!), a vote for another small party and casting a blank or invalid vote.\n\nWe investigate the impact of political trust on vote choices while controlling for a number of\n\nsocio-demographic control variables. We control for respondents’ gender, age and level of\n\neducation – distinguishing between low levels of education (with no or less than a high school\n\ndegree), middle levels (with only a high school degree) and high levels of education (with a\n\nhigher education degree). We additionally control for respondents’ level of political interest\n\nand their self-placement on an ideological left-right scale (both measured on a 0-10-scale).\n\n10\n\nWe also investigate how attitudes of political trust evolve after voting for a populist or protest\n\nparty. To test our third hypothesis, we first descriptively analyse the evolution of levels of\n\npolitical trust for voters of different parties. Subsequently, we perform a multivariate analysis\n\nexplaining the impact of the vote choice in 2009 on levels of political trust in 2014, while\n\ncontrolling for the 2009 level of political trust. For doing so, we run an OLS regression, in\n\nwhich we control for the same set of socio-demographic characteristics as included in the vote\n\nchoice model as well.\n\n4.RESULTS\n\nBefore investigating the over-time effects of political trust and voting for protest parties, we\n\nassess whether in the Flemish region – as was the case in 2009 (Hooghe et al., 2011) – levels\n\nof political trust are strongly correlated to preferring particular parties in 2014. For the French\n\nlanguage party system, we expect that – as in 2009 – there is no clear pattern of distrusting\n\nvoters choosing specific parties. We control for the effect of gender, age, levels of education,\n\npolitical interest and left-right self-placement. The full results of this multinomial regression\n\nanalysis for the Flemish region are included in Appendix 1 and suggest that political trust is\n\nindeed significantly related to respondents’ party preferences. Higher levels of political trust\n\nsignificantly decrease the probability of intending to vote for the liberal party Open VLD, the\n\nFlemish nationalist party N-VA, the extreme-right Vlaams Belang, another party and\n\nintending to cast a blank or invalid vote compared to intending to vote for the Christian\n\nDemocrats.\n\nAs the coefficients obtained from a multinomial logit model are relative to the reference\n\ncategory and hence hard to interpret, in Figure 1 we present the average adjusted predictions\n\nof intending to vote for each of the parties by different levels of political trust. The results are\n\nin line with what was observed in 2009. Low levels of political trust are associated with\n\nhigher probabilities of voting N-VA, Vlaams Belang or casting a blank or invalid vote. The\n\nresults offer support for our first hypothesis, as lower levels of political trust are associated\n\nwith higher probabilities of voting for protest parties. Even though the Flemish-nationalist\n\nparty N-VA is not generally characterized as a protest party (Hooghe et al., 2011; Boonen &\n\nHooghe, 2014), the impact of distrust is strongest for this party. For the other parties, there is\n\nhardly any impact of political trust at all, with the notable exception of CD&V. A higher level\n\nof political trust strongly and significantly increases the probability to intend to vote for the\n\n11\n\nChristian Democratic party in 2014. A possible explanation for this finding is that the party is\n\nperceived by Flemish voters as the main historical incumbent (Hooghe & Dassonneville,\n\n2012).\n\n12\n\nFigure 1. Average adjusted predictions of intending to vote for each of the parties by political trust (2014) – Flemish region\n\nSource: Belgian Election Panel, BEP 2009-2014. Data are weighted by socio-demographics (gender, age and level of education). Average adjusted predictions and 95%-confidence intervals based on the model in Appendix 1.\n\nNext, we investigate the effect of political trust in 2014 on the vote intentions of Walloon\n\nrespondents. As we have done for the Flemish case as well, we estimate a multinomial logit\n\nmodel and specify the Christian Democratic party (cdH) as the reference group. As there are\n\nno real protest parties among the French-speaking political parties, we do not expect one\n\nspecific party to attract distrusting voters. The full results of this estimation are reported in\n\nAppendix 2 and indicate that for the main parties (i.e., Greens, Liberals or Socialists) there are\n\nno significant effects of political trust on the voters’ likelihood of voting for one of these\n\nparties rather than choosing cdH, the reference category in our analyses. We do observe,\n\nhowever, that those who voted for the extreme-left party PTB-Go!, those who voted for one of\n\nthe smaller parties (e.g., FDF and FN) or those who casted a blank or invalid vote are\n\nsignificantly less trusting than those who intended to vote for cdH in 2014.\n\nTo ease the interpretation of these results, in Figure 2 we present the average adjusted\n\npredictions of intending to vote for each of the parties by different levels of political trust.\n\nWhile the effect of political trust to vote PTB Go!, another small party or to cast a\n\nblank/invalid vote is clearly negative, confidence intervals are rather wide – which is due to\n\nthe small number of respondents in each of these categories. Furthermore, plotting the\n\nestimated effect of political trust on vote intention clarifies that having a higher level of trust\n\nin politics in 2014 is significantly increasing the probability of intending to vote for the\n\nsocialist party PS. In line with the observation that high levels of political trust increased the\n\nprobability of voting CD&V in the Flemish region, we observe that in the Walloon region as\n\nwell the party that is generally and historically conceived of as the main incumbent is\n\nattracting the most trusting voters (Dassonneville & Hooghe, 2012).\n\nFigure 2. Average adjusted predictions of intending to vote for each of the parties by political trust (2014) – Walloon region\n\nSource: Belgian Election Panel, BEP 2009-2014. Data are weighted by gender, age and level of education. Average adjusted predictions and 95%-confidence intervals based on the model in Appendix 2.\n\nThe descriptive statistics for political trust in Table 1 already clarified that there was a decline\n\nin levels of political trust between 2009 and 2014. In a next step, we assess how these changes\n\nin trust levels between 2009 and 2014 affect what parties voters prefer. Therefore, we add to\n\nthe models presented in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 respondents’ evolution of political trust\n\nbetween 2009 and 2014 (Δ political trust). This indicator takes a positive value if respondents\n\nare becoming more trusting in politics between 2009 and 2014 and a negative value if their\n\nlevel of trust in politics decreases. The predominant pattern among panel respondents is one\n\nof decreasing levels of trust in politics. For the Flemish case in particular, we can also\n\nintroduce a distinction between trust in the regional institutions (with N-VA in the governing\n\ncoalition) and the federal institutions of Belgium (without N-VA in the governing coalition) as\n\nthis allows us to observe whether the participation of N-VA in the regional governmental\n\ncoalition actually makes a difference for Flemish respondents.\n\nThe full results of these multinomial logistic regression analyses are presented in Appendix 3\n\n(Flemish region) and Appendix 4 (Walloon region). First, for the Flemish region, results\n\nindicate that besides respondents’ level of political trust, the evolution of this attitude as well\n\nis correlated to vote intentions. As levels of trust increased between 2009 and 2014, panel\n\nrespondents became significantly less likely to intend voting for the N-VA, Vlaams Belang or\n\nto cast a blank or invalid vote compared to voting for the Christian Democratic party CD&V.\n\nWe graphically present the estimated effect of Δ political trust on intending to vote for each of\n\nthe parties in Figure 3. The graphs clarify that similarly to what holds for levels of political\n\ntrust in the Flemish region as well, for change in trust-levels, effects are strongest for CD&V\n\non the one hand and N-VA on the other. First, as voters become more trusting between 2009\n\nand 2014, this significantly increases their probability of voting for the Christian Democratic\n\nparty. The reverse is true for voting Vlaams Belang or casting a blank/invalid vote, although\n\nthese effects are only marginally significant. For the Flemish nationalist party, we observe that\n\nimproving trust levels significantly decrease the probability that respondents intend to vote N VA.\n\nFigure 3.

Average adjusted predictions and 95%-confidence intervals based on the model presented in Appendix 3\n\nFor the Walloon region as well, focusing on the evolution of political trust over the electoral\n\ncycle results in similar conclusions. From the full results in Appendix 4 it can be observed that\n\nthere are no significant differences in the impact of Δ trust on choosing any of the main parties\n\nover cdH. We note, however, that a higher Δ-value is significantly decreasing the probability\n\nof choosing PTB Go!, another party or of casting a blank/invalid voter over cdH. The\n\ngraphical representation of these effects (Figure 4) illustrates that variations in Δ trust have\n\nvirtually no impact on the likelihood of voting cdH, Ecolo or MR, while we also note that\n\nhigher Δ values are significantly increasing the probability of voting for the PS. For choosing\n\nthe extreme-left PTB Go!, another small party or for casting a blank/invalid vote, finally, the\n\nestimated effect of Δ trust is negative, but highly uncertain.\n\nFigure 4.

Data are weighted by gender, age and level of education. Average adjusted predictions and 95%-confidence intervals based on the model presented in Appendix 4.\n\nCombined, the results offer support for our second hypothesis: protest parties succeed in\n\nattracting voters who are becoming more distrustful. The analyses thus indicate that low levels\n\nof political trust as well as a decline of trust increase the probability of voting for protest\n\nparties. The contrast between the Flemish and Walloon region furthermore highlights the key\n\nrole played by protest parties: in Wallonia, where there are no clear protest parties running for\n\nelection, patterns of protest voting remain more diffuse.\n\nIn the Flemish region, the Flemish nationalist party N-VA in particular succeeds in attracting\n\nvoters who are becoming more distrusting over time. Since 2009, however, this party was part\n\nof the governing coalition at the regional level.4 Therefore the N-VA could no longer be\n\nconsidered a pure protest party at the regional level – in contrast to what holds at the federal\n\nlevel, where the party was in opposition. As an additional test, we therefore investigate how\n\nevolutions in regional political trust5 and federal political trust6 respectively affect voting\n\nbehaviour in the 2014 elections. The results of these analyses are presented in Appendix 5 and\n\nAppendix 6 and indicate that for both levels of governance decreasing levels of political trust\n\nsignificantly increase the probability of choosing N-VA, Vlaams Belang or casting a\n\nblank/invalid vote over choosing CD&V, confirming what we observed for a general sense of\n\npolitical trust. Even though the estimated impact of decreasing levels of federal political trust\n\non choosing the N-VA is somewhat stronger compared to the effect of decreasing levels of\n\nregional political trust – the status of the Flemish Nationalist party as an incumbent at the\n\nregional level does not seem to inhibit it from attracting voters who have become more\n\ndistrusting towards that specific level of government.\n\nThe question that remains is what subsequently happens to voters who have voted for a protest\n\nparty? Does voting for a protest party suffice as a way to channel dissatisfaction, as Miller and\n\nListhaug (1990) assume? Or do protest parties further ‘fuel’ distrust, as we hypothesized? We\n\nfirst descriptively assess changes in levels of political trust between 2009 and 2014 for the\n\nelectorates of different parties. As evident from mean levels of change in political trust, on\n\naverage, voters have become less trusting in political institutions, with a decrease of about 0.5\n\namong Flemish respondents and a 1-point decrease on the 0-10 trust scale among Walloon\n\n4. The regional government in Flanders between 2009 and 2014 was a coalition between Christian Democrats, Nationalists and Socialists, with two Nationalist ministers (out of a total of nine). 5 . A sum-scale of trust in the regional parliament and the regional government. 6 . A sum-scale of trust in the federal parliament and the federal government.\n\nrespondents. Furthermore, for both groups levels of trust in the regional institutions\n\n(parliament and government) have decreased somewhat more than levels of trust in the federal\n\ninstitutions. In terms of the differences between parties, among the Dutch language parties,\n\nwe note the strongest decrease in levels of political trust among those who voted Vlaams\n\nBelang, N-VA or Open VLD in 2009. Table 2 also offers indications that N-VA voters are\n\ndistinguishing between different levels of government. Their decrease of trust at the regional\n\nlevel – where the party was in the governing coalition – is less pronounced (-1.10) than what\n\nholds for the federal level (-1.41), where the party still was in opposition. It is remarkable,\n\nthough, that having entered the regional coalition did not have a beneficial effect on the level\n\nof trust of N-VA voters in that level of government. For the electorates of the French language\n\nparties, levels of political trust have decreased in all groups, but quite markedly so among\n\nthose who voted for the socialist party in 2009.\n\nTable 2.

N Flemish respondents =500 and N Walloon respondents = 364. Mean values are reported. Values for groups <20 are not shown.\n\nWhile indicative, descriptive statistics are not sufficient for drawing strong conclusions on the\n\nimpact of having voted for a particular party. We therefore proceed with the estimation of\n\nOLS regressions, explaining respondents’ change in political trust levels between 2009 and\n\n2014.7 Besides the socio-demographic variables gender, age and level of education, we also\n\ncontrol for voters’ level of political trust in 2009, which takes into account potential ceiling\n\neffects when investigating the evolution of trust over time. For assessing the impact of voting\n\n7. The reliance on a panel design implies that the data suffer from attrition. As a way to account for this, we analysed the data weighted by vote choice as well. The results of these analyses are not substantially different from the results reported here.\n\nfor a protest party on change in political trust, we add a series of dummy variables on\n\nrespondents’ reported vote in 2009. For both language groups, we present three models, one\n\nexplaining the evolution in general levels of political trust, a second model focusing on\n\nregional institutions, and a third on federal institutions.\n\nThe results for the Dutch language parties are presented in Table 3. First, it has to be noted\n\nthat it is indeed important to control for the 2009 level of political trust, as the level of trust is\n\nsignificantly related to the subsequent change in trust levels. Most importantly, the results\n\noffer evidence for the thesis that protest parties are fuelling dissatisfaction. Respondents who\n\nvoted for either the Flemish nationalist party N-VA or for Vlaams Belang in 2009 had a\n\nsignificantly stronger decrease in trust between 2009 and 2014 compared to those who voted\n\nCD&V in 2009. Additionally, even though the previous analyses indicated that lower levels of\n\ntrust as well as a strong decrease of political trust are significantly correlated to casting a\n\nblank or invalid vote, the results in Table 3 do not indicate a similar ‘strengthening’ of distrust\n\nfor those voters as what holds for those who voted for a protest party. This offers support for\n\nthe causal mechanism suggested by Dinas (2014). When focusing on trust in the regional or\n\nfederal levels of government only, differences are minor and those who voted for N-VA and\n\nVlaams Belang in 2009 are consistently more distrusting over time. Focusing on having voted\n\nN-VA in 2009, the effect is somewhat smaller for regional political trust than for federal trust,\n\nbut we note a significant decrease in both cases. The fact that among the 2009 N-VA voters,\n\nthe trust in the regional institutions (in which the N-VA participated) further declined, shows\n\nan interesting dynamic. While Miller and Listhaug (1990) assumed that giving protest parties\n\na say in government could restore political trust among their supporters, the opposite seems to\n\noccur, as protest parties ‘contaminate’ the level they participate in. The fact that we do not\n\nobserve all that much difference between Vlaams Belang and N-VA voters is highly relevant.\n\nWhile the Vlaams Belang remained stuck in the opposition, the N-VA joined the coalition at\n\nthe regional level. Opposition or government, however, does not seem to have an effect on the\n\ndevelopment of trust levels among their supporters. Both groups of the electorate firmly\n\ncontinue to display all the characteristics of a protest vote.\n\nThe results indicate that the N-VA effectively is associated with low levels of political trust.\n\nNot only the party attracts voters with lower levels of political trust, it has also been found\n\nthat N-VA voters subsequently are more likely to develop even lower levels of political trust.\n\nThese findings are all the more remarkable, since in reality, during the 2010-2014 period, the\n\nN-VA occupied a rather ambiguous position in the Belgian federal system, by being in\n\nopposition on the federal level, while joining the governing coalition on the regional level. It\n\nfalls outside the scope of the current article to explain this finding, but two potential\n\nexplanations come to mind. First, it is possible that Belgian voters consider the federal level to\n\nbe the most important level of government, with as a result that the N-VA for them was first of\n\nall an opposition party. A second possibility is that the party itself stressed in its campaign\n\nrhetoric its opposition to the federal government, while it downplayed its accomplishments\n\nwithin the regional government. Further research is needed to assess which explanation is\n\nmost plausible.\n\nFor voters in Wallonia, the descriptive results in Table 2 indicated that especially those who\n\nvoted for the PS in 2009 became more distrusting over the 2009-2014 electoral cycle. In Table\n\n4, we assess whether a vote for the socialist (or any other electoral choice in 2009) has\n\nsignificantly affected the subsequent evolution of political trust in general, regional political\n\ntrust or federal political trust. Unlike what we observed for Flemish respondents, none of the\n\n2009-vote options significantly affects the evolution of respondents’ attitudes of political trust\n\nover time. In the Walloon electoral context – a context that is marked by the absence of\n\nclearly identifiable protest parties – we find no evidence that particular parties would be\n\nfueling political distrust.\n\nTable 3.

Furthermore, becoming more distrustful in between two\n\nelections as well increases the probability of voting for a protest party. As levels of political\n\ntrust are deteriorating, protest parties not only electorally benefit from the fact that the pool of\n\nlow trusting voters is growing, the voters who are becoming less trusting are also more likely\n\nto vote for protest parties. If we want to understand how attitudes as political trust affect\n\npolitical behaviour, it is hence important not only to look at levels but also to take into\n\naccount changing attitudes. Longer panel data could shed light on fluctuations over a more\n\nextended period of time and provide insights in what happens if respondents vote for an anti establishment party for a longer period of time. Interestingly, whether the protest party joins a\n\ngovernment coalition (N-VA) or not (Vlaams Belang), does not seem to change this fuelling\n\neffect. For mainstream parties it is therefore not clear at all how they can react to the\n\nchallenge of protest parties. Following a ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ logic, both\n\nignoring and incorporating protest parties seem to have exactly the same effect\n\nOur findings hint at a ‘spiral of distrust’.8 Low levels of trust as well as decreasing levels of\n\npolitical trust increase the probability of voting for a protest party. Having chosen such a party\n\nsubsequently acts to decrease one’s level of trust in politics even further. The result is a spiral\n\nof distrust, where distrust and protest voting enforce each other. Miller and Listhaug (1990)\n\nwere quite optimistic on how flexible party systems would allow protest parties to rise. Such\n\nparties, according to Miller and Listhaug, could channel dissatisfaction and stop the\n\naccumulation of discontent. What we observe in the Belgian multiparty system, is more in\n\nline with what van der Brug suggested to hold in the Netherlands; protest parties can ‘fuel’\n\ndiscontent and this discontent even rises further when the protest party is integrated in the\n\n8. This concept is of course derived from the seminal concept of a ‘spiral of silence’, coined by Noelle-Neumann (1982).\n\ngoverning coalition. In line with the argument by Dinas, casting a protest vote apparently\n\nleads to the consolidation of a specific political identity, and voters further develop the\n\nattitudes that are congruent with their party preference. The key role that protest parties play\n\nin this ‘spiral of distrust’ is evident from the contrast between voting behaviour in the Flemish\n\nand Walloon regions of Belgium. Among Flemish voters, those who voted for protest parties\n\nare becoming significantly less trusting over time. In the French language party system, that is\n\nmarked by the absence of a clear protest party, we do not observe a pattern in which having\n\nvoted for a particular party leads voters to become even less trusting over time.\n\nObviously, this study comes with a number of important limitations. First, the analysis is\n\nrestricted to one particular case: the Belgian electoral context in the 2009-2014 period. Future\n\nresearch should hence clarify whether our observations can be generalized more broadly, and\n\nto political systems without compulsory voting. The fact however, that for List Pim Fortuyn in\n\nthe Netherlands as well previous research has pointed out a pattern of ‘fuelling’ discontent,\n\nsuggests that what we observe is not a particularity of Belgian electoral politics. Second, it has\n\nto be remembered that we only have data for one electoral cycle of five years. It is possible\n\nthat this is not sufficient as an observation period to document the transformation from a\n\nprotest party toward a ‘party in government’. For convincingly showing the presence of a\n\n‘spiral of distrust’ we would ideally make use of a panel study that covers a more extended\n\nperiod of time. Third, the use of panel data also comes with disadvantages, of which panel attrition is an essential one. Four, our results point out that those who voted for a protest party\n\nsubsequently become more distrusting, but we can only speculate about the mechanism\n\ncausing this pattern. More research, linking individual-level data with data on campaign\n\ncoverage, is needed to enhance our knowledge of whether and how parties actively contribute\n\nto the spiral of distrust. Better insight in the exact causal mechanisms determining the spiral\n\nof distrust might also provide more specific suggestions on how the spiral could be reversed.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nArzheimer, K.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital engagement techniques became increasingly attractive to parliaments with the potential to improve both the quality and efficiency of public engagement in lawmaking, savings, and possible improvements in democratic participation. To capitalise on these potential benefits, and to avoid any unjustifiable risks, parliaments must understand the importance of connecting the people to their parliaments and which practices and technologies could be used to improve the quality and diversity of public engagement with parliaments in Australia. Drawing upon insights shared during a series of international workshops on public engagement by the International Parliamentary Engagement Network (‘IPEN’), this article aims to describe the key ingredients for effective evaluation of public engagement by parliaments and share the toolkit developed by the IPEN workshops.\n\nCONTENTS I Introduction ............................................................................................ 2 II Understanding Public Engagement ........................................................ 4 III The Importance of Connecting People to Parliaments ........................... 6 IV Innovations Designed to Enhance the Diversity and Quality of Public Engagement .................................................................................................... 10\n\nA E-petitions ................................................................................... 10 B Partnership-hosted Consultations ................................................ 11 C Citizens’ Juries ............................................................................ 12 D Mini Publics ................................................................................ 13 E Deliberative Software ................................................................. 14 F Voice to Parliament ..................................................................... 15 Evaluating Public Engagement Mechanisms Employed by Australian Parliaments ..................................................................................................... 16 V Conclusion ............................................................................................ 19 VI Appendix: Questions for a Public Engagement Evaluation Toolkit ..... 20\n\n* BIS, LLB, LLM (Adelaide), PhD (Adelaide); Senior Lecturer, School of Law, University of\n\nSouth Australia.\n\n2 University of South Australia Law Review Vol 5\n\nI INTRODUCTION\n\nAugust 2020 marked the first time the Australian Parliament relied exclusively on digital means to connect parliamentarians to the communities they represent. This shift towards digital engagement has become increasingly important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where parliaments have been forced to embrace technology to continue their democratic functions. Some parliaments, such as those in Brazil and Spain,1 were able to draw upon past experiences to digitally connect parliamentarians with each other and their constituents. Other parliaments, including in Australia, took longer to ‘move online’,2 diluting their capacity to connect meaningfully with each other and the Australian people. The pandemic is not the only pressure on parliaments to change the way members interact with one another and their constituencies. Distrust in traditional political processes, increasing travel costs and other accessibility factors are causing parliaments around the world to experiment with new ways of connecting.3\n\nThere are many reasons why public engagement is beneficial for parliaments, parliamentarians, and the community. Above all, public engagement supports a parliament’s main functions by giving access to the breadth and depth of information and ideas that are needed for representation, lawmaking, public policy formulation, and oversight to meet a society’s expectations and aspirations.4\n\nFostering a strong and meaningful connection between people and their elected representatives is the central work of any functioning democracy, particularly\n\n1 European Parliament, ‘Remote voting in the European Parliament and national parliaments’ (Research Note, 25 March 2020) <https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/649348/EPRS_ATA(2020)649348_EN.pdf> (‘Remote Voting in the European Parliament’).\n\n2 Interparliamentary Union, ‘Preserving parliament’s functionality during the COVID-19 pandemic: Brazil’s experience’ (Innovation Tracker Issue, 20 July 2020) <https://www.ipu.org/innovation-tracker/story/preserving-parliaments-func-tionality-duringcovid-19-pandemic-brazils-experience>.\n\n3 See generally Mark Evans and Gerry Stoker, Saving Democracy (Bloomsbury, 2021); Electoral Reform Society, ‘Share your views on the success of the Virtual Parliament’, Electoral Reform Organisation (Website) <https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk-/share-yourviews-on-the-virtual-parliaments-success>; Remote Voting in the European Parliament (n 1); Michelle Grattan, ‘View from The Hill: 'Virtual' participants and border restrictions will make for a bespoke parliamentary sitting’, The Conversation (Web Page) 17 August 2020; Carolyn M Hendriks, Sue Regan and Adrian Kay, ‘Participatory Adaptation in Contemporary Parliamentary Committees in Australia’ (2019) 72(2) Parliamentary Affairs 267; Phil Parvin, ‘Is Deliberative Democracy Feasible?

This includes through the work of parliamentary committees, which have been active sites of public lawmaking in Westminster-inspired parliaments.7\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, digital engagement techniques such as secure video conferencing and legislation tracking apps, have become increasingly attractive to parliaments with the potential to improve both the quality and efficiency of public engagement in lawmaking. These improvements, in turn, have led to cost savings and possible improvements in democratic participation.8 To capitalise on these potential benefits, and to avoid any unjustifiable risks, society must better understand why it is important for people to be connected to the parliamentary lawmaking process. This could be supported by increased awareness as to which strategies and tools could be used to improve the quality and legislative impact of public engagement with parliaments. While there are some promising case studies of individual experiences with innovative parliamentary public engagement strategies,9\n\n5 Evans and Stoker (n 3) i-v.

Leston-Bandeira adds that the step of identification involves citizens perceiving the relevance of parliaments to their own lives and experiences.15 This can lead to participation, but also deliberation, which is a process in which citizens not only participate, but also engage with parliamentarians to lead or significantly shape an activity that contributes to a parliamentary decision.\n\nThe idea of deliberation requires that decision-makers have access to accurate and relevant information, consider a diversity of voices and positions, reflect on information received, and reach conclusions based on evidence.16 When applied to lawmaking, this requires lawmakers to go beyond the idea of\n\n10 Note that IPEN was created in 2020 to bring together academics, parliamentary officials and third sector representatives from all over the world who work on public engagement and parliament. IPEN currently has 219 members from over 30 countries. IPEN aims to share good practice, identify key challenges and ways to address these, promote the exchange of information between practitioners and academics and lead to the enhancement of practices.

Strategic: Embed a culture of engagement across parliament for a united and concerted effort towards broader and better public participation.\n\n2. Inclusive: Make inclusion a priority so that parliament is accessible to all community members.\n\n3. Participatory: Encourage people to participate in setting the agenda through opportunities to influence the issues taken up by parliament.\n\n4. Innovative: Lead with bold and creative approaches that involve and inspire the community to engage with parliament now and into the future.\n\n5. Responsive: Focus on meeting public expectations by listening to community feedback and continually improving.19\n\nParticipants also explained that facilitating good quality engagement did not mean ‘asking everyone all the time’ but rather ensuring quality encounters, allowing time for meaningful dialogues, and openness to changing positions. While this is a challenge for some highly politicised environments like Parliaments, there are many recent and local examples of efforts to develop and implement public engagement strategies with these features.20 Participants from the Australasian region, who gathered online to discuss their public parliamentary engagement experiences, were keen to note that when undertaking ‘public engagement’ in Australia, it must be recognised that the Australian public is not one homogenous group, but rather a complex and\n\n17 Ron Levy and Graeme Orr, The Law of Deliberative Democracy (Routledge, 2016).\n\n18 IPEN Toolkit (n 10).\n\n19 IPU Report (n 4) 8.\n\n20 See, eg, In Their Own Voice (n 9); Emma Banyer, ‘The Franking Credits Controversy: House\n\nof Representatives Committees, Public Engagement and the Role of the Parliamentary Service’ (2020) 35(1) Australasian Parliamentary Review 1; Vlahos (n 9).\n\n6 University of South Australia Law Review Vol 5\n\ndynamic intersection of many different ‘publics’, each demanding careful attention when considering engagement strategies and methods.21\n\nThose at the IPEN workshop identified some of the qualities of good public engagement as connecting to the idea of empowering those who have previously been disengaged through inclusive, meaningful communication and building relationships based on listening and trust. This, in turn, demands positive action on behalf of the institution or body seeking to engage another group to not just share information and invite participation, but to relinquish some control over the substantive agenda and the process of engagement. This can be challenging in the case of parliamentary engagement where often both the substantive agenda and the process are intrinsically connected to the institution of a parliament. It can also give rise to mismatches in expectations between parliamentarians, parliamentary staff, and public participants. Stoker and Evans find that citizens prefer measures that make politicians more accountable over getting directly involved themselves.22 This is where learning from digital and other innovations employed by parliaments around the world can offer Australia a pathway forward to improving the quality of its engagement between society and parliaments.\n\nIII THE IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTING PEOPLE TO\n\nPARLIAMENTS\n\nAs Evans and Stoker explore in Saving Democracy, Australia is at a critical juncture when it comes to public trust and satisfaction with democratic institutions and practices.23 In the last decade, a significant decline has been\n\nseen in public trust for parliaments and other public institutions,24 but the recent COVID-19 experience has seen a shift in the way citizens are viewing and interacting with their elected representatives. This has led Evans and\n\nStoker, Hendriks and Kay25 and Laing and Walker,26 to:\n\n21 See, eg, Gabrielle Appleby and Eddie Synot ‘A First Nations Voice: Institutionalising\n\nPolitical Listening’ (2020) 48(4) Federal Law Review 529, 529-42; Dani Larkin, ‘Membership Models for an Indigenous Voice: What does representation mean for First Nations?’ Indigenous Constitutional Law Blog (Blog Post, 11 March 2021) <https://www.indigconlaw.org/home/membership-models-for-an-indigenous-voice-whatdoes-representation-mean-for-first-nations>.\n\n22 Evans and Stoker (n 3) 130–1.\n\n23 Mark Evans and Gerry Stoker, Saving Democracy (Bloomsbury, 2021) i-v.\n\n24 See Robert Foa et al, The Global Satisfaction with Democracy Report 2020 (Report, January\n\n2020) <https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/publications/-global-sati sfaction-democracy-report-2020/>.\n\n25 Hendriks, Regan and Kay (n 3).\n\n26 Laing and Walker (n 9).\n\nVol 5 Sarah Moulds 7\n\n[I]gnite a national conversation on how we can bridge the trust divide between government and citizen, strengthen democratic practice, and restore the confidence of Australians in the performance of their political institutions.27\n\nIt is not just Australia that needs to ignite this type of national conversation. As the IPU Report provides:\n\nSince parliaments derive their legitimacy from the people, public disenchantment threatens their authority. As representative institutions, parliaments are duty-bound to listen to the community and to meet public expectations when making laws, investigating public policy issues and holding the government to account. For decades now, parliaments have been working on ways to better engage with the communities they represent. Public engagement can take many forms and can be conducted either directly with individual community members or through organized groups. It encompasses the various processes and activities through which parliament connects with the community – to inform, educate, communicate, consult and involve. Declining trust in public institutions means that parliaments cannot simply continue with business as usual. It challenges parliaments to assess the progress they have made and to step up their efforts at engagement. Reversing the trend of disenchantment requires concerted action going forward.28\n\nIdentifying different tools and strategies for public engagement, and the reasons they are effective is a critical component of the national parliamentary engagement conversation and is essential to improve the quality of deliberation and connection that citizens feel for Australian parliaments.29 This type of citizen connection to parliaments can also improve the quality of the laws and policies made by elected representatives by incentivizing and encouraging deliberative lawmaking based on ‘decision-making through discussion among free and equal citizens [rather than] simply the aggregation of [political] preferences.’30\n\nBy engaging with the public, parliaments and parliamentarians deliver their fundamental democratic duty ‘to uncover and publicise issues of public concern’. When parliaments make efforts to consult with the public, they provide effective representation both to majority and minority views and serve the public interest.31\n\n27 Evans and Stoker (n 3) i.\n\n28 IPU Report (n 4) 10.\n\n29 John Dryzek and Simon Niemeyer, ‘What is deliberative democracy?’ (Deliberative\n\nDemocracy Webblogs, 15 February 2021) <https://deldem.weblogs.anu.edu.au/2012/02/15/what-is-deliberative-democracy/>\n\n30 Jon Elster, Deliberative Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 1st ed, 1999) 1.\n\n31 Patrick Dunleavy, Alice Park and Ros Taylor, The UK's Changing Democracy : the 2018\n\nDemocratic Audit (LSE Press, 1st ed, 2018).\n\n8 University of South Australia Law Review Vol 5\n\nIn Laing and Walker’s recent work, New Options for Parliamentary Committees, which was prepared for committee chairs within the NSW Parliament, the authors described some of the benefits of deliberative approaches to parliamentary decision-making as follows:32\n\n❖ Better policy outcomes because deliberation results in considered public judgements rather than public opinions.\n\n❖ Greater legitimacy to make hard choices.\n\n❖ Enhance[d] public trust in government and democratic institutions by giving citizens an effective role in public decision-making.\n\n❖ Make[s] governance more inclusive by opening the door to a much more diverse group of people.\n\n❖ Help[s] counteract polarisation and disinformation.33\n\n❖ Similar benefits of effective parliamentary public engagement have also been identified by the NZ Parliament when it evaluated the effectiveness of its 2018– 2021 public engagement strategy.34 It found that during the 2019 and 2020, when explicit public engagement strategies were employed:\n\n➢ Parliament’s reputation improved (up from 53.9 to 61.2 points, on a scale from 10 to 100).\n\n➢ New Zealanders were more likely to advocate for Parliament (up from 10 per cent to 15 per cent).\n\n➢ People were less likely to be critical of Parliament (down from 22 per cent to 15 per cent).\n\n➢ Commitment to voting increased sharply (up from 18 per cent to 32 per cent).\n\n➢ Refusal to vote decreased (down from 17 per cent to 8 per cent).35\n\nThe IPU Report stated that:\n\nPublic engagement matters because it is mutually beneficial for communities, for parliaments as institutions and for individual members of parliament (MPs). It enables parliaments to create better laws and policies by tapping into wider sources of information. It cultivates knowledge in communities and improves the quality of decision-making. It also allows closer monitoring of policy implementation. And in doing so, it sustains representative democracy in a rapidly changing world.36\n\nFlow-on benefits associated with improving the quality of public engagement with parliamentary lawmaking include improving Australia’s international\n\n32 Laing and Walker (n 9) 11.\n\n33 Ibid.\n\n34 New Zealand Parliament, Survey of the New Zealand Public: January 2021 (Report, January\n\n2021).\n\n35 IPU Report (n 4) 15.\n\n36 Ibid.\n\nVol 5 Sarah Moulds 9\n\nstanding with respect to a range of heuristics employed by the UN Human Rights. This aligns with Australia’s international law obligations, including article 21 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights which protects the right of all persons to participate in public affairs. Exploring and experimenting with new ways of connecting the people to parliaments may also have a range of practical benefits for parliamentarians themselves. For example, early studies suggest parliaments that adopt new technology can have benefits in terms of promoting diversity in parliamentary processes. Early data from the House of Lords suggests that there were more debates and more contributions from female MPs when technology is used to promote public engagement with parliamentary processes. Scottish National Party MP, Kirsty Blackman, has noted that remote parliamentary engagement provisions have made it easier for MPs with disabilities to participate in decision-making processes.37 Other research suggests that digital forms of public engagement with parliaments can improve the diversity and quality of public engagement through reducing travel time and related costs for MPs and their staff, improve participation for underrepresented groups (including women, carers, and persons with disabilities), and improve the deliberative quality of democratic lawmaking.38\n\nThe need for a deliberative approach to parliamentary lawmaking and to public engagement was also recognised as a high priority by those working within Australian parliaments at the Australian Hub of the IPEN workshops hosted on 26 March 2021. These discussions generated a common view that improving parliamentary public engagement is not an option but a necessity for modern democracies like Australia, and that Australian parliamentarians should make this a key priority to engage young people, First Nations people, and other vulnerable groups.39 There was also an agreement at the IPEN workshops to commit to improving the quality of public engagement and deliberation within Australian parliaments. This should not be misunderstood as ‘asking everyone all the time’, but rather ensuring quality encounters, time for meaningful dialogues and exchanges and openness to changing positions. It was also considered important to recognise that, as Hendriks, Regan and Kay opine, there is not one ‘public’ but many ‘publics’ and each public demands careful attention when considering engagement strategies and methods.40 For\n\n37 Electoral Reform Society, ‘Share your views on the success of the Virtual Parliament’,\n\nElectoral Reform Org (Web Page, 28 May 2020) <https://www. electoral-reform.org.uk/share-your-views-on-the-virtual-parliaments-success/>.\n\n38 See, eg, Remote Voting in the European Parliament (n 1).\n\n39 Sarah Moulds, ‘Connected Parliaments: An International Conversation on Public Engagement\n\nand its Impact on Parliaments’ (2021) 36(1) Australasian Parliamentary Review 109.\n\n40 Hendriks, Regan and Kay (n 3).\n\n10 University of South Australia Law Review Vol 5\n\nexample, First Nations peoples must have the opportunity not just to be listened to in response to parliamentary activity, but to have an active voice in the way that Australian parliaments work, engage with, and exercise legal and political sovereignty over First Nations peoples.41\n\nIn this context, evaluating engagement strategies and looking for impact beyond the immediate success or failure of a particular technique or inquiry is critical to ensure that Australian parliaments accurately capture the resources required to do things better in the future, and to make the case for more investment in the right engagement activities.42\n\nIV INNOVATIONS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY\n\nAND QUALITY OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT\n\nThere are a wide range of tools and strategies that can be employed by parliaments to improve the quality and diversity of public engagement.43 The suitability of each of these tools and strategies for any parliament or group within a parliament will depend on a range of factors including institutional context and the key attributes of the public or publics that the parliament is trying to reach.44 However, before introducing the factors that might help a parliament select or evaluate a particular tool or strategy, it is useful to provide a snapshot of some of the different innovations currently being explored or employed in Australia or in comparable jurisdictions to help illustrate the continuum of possibilities and experiences that can be drawn upon when developing local options.\n\nA E-petitions\n\nPetitioning the Parliament is a long-established, direct, and lineal form of public engagement initiated by a citizen or group who asks the a parliament to take specific policy or legislative action. Historically, petitions have needed to be presented in writing and adhere to a specific physical form; however, since 2016, the Australian Parliament has accepted ‘e-petitions’ which has resulted in an exponential increase in petitions being considered by the House Petitions’\n\n41 See, eg, Appleby and Synot (n 21); Larkin (n 21).\n\n42 See, eg, Sarah Moulds Committees of Influence (Springer, 2020) ch 10.\n\n43 A range of other examples are summarised in this video produced by the Inter-Parliamentary\n\nUnion’s Centre for Innovation in Parliament (Website, July 2021) Inter-Parliamentary Union, ‘Innovation in Parliament’ (Youtube, 21 July 2021 AEST) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFeqcl828wQ&list=PLLwJpE_Efv M49JX-xS8mrPjnp-Au7ZtaY&index=6>.\n\n44 See, eg, Ryan Kennedy et al, ‘Demographics and (Equal?)

However, it lacks many of the deliberative features present in other forms of public engagement.47 For this reason, it is often used as a supplement (or sometimes a so-called ‘trigger point’) for other public engagement strategies.48\n\nB Partnership-hosted Consultations\n\nParliamentary committees have long been the site of engagement between citizens and members of parliament, particularly committees with broad powers of inquiry.49 While these groups of parliamentarians have traditionally called for written submissions through print media or direct written invitation, parliamentary committees have been experimenting with innovative new ways to reach different or more diverse audiences. This includes using digital communication tools (including websites, social media, and video conference technology) to receive input from the community, facilitate public hearings, and share information about outcomes.50 Some parliamentary committees, including those within the Scottish Parliament, have also engaged with community-based partners to facilitate the collection of evidence from ‘hard\n\n45 See UK Parliament Committees (Website) <https://committees.parliament.uk/ committee/326/petitions-committee/>.\n\n46 See Australian Parliament ‘House of Representatives Powers, Practice and Procedure\n\nInfoSheet 11 Petitions’ South Australian Parliament: Petitions (Web Page, 2022) <https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representat ives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_11_-_Petitions>.

For example, the Scottish Health and Sports Committee partnered with community organisations to hear from a group with a wide range of disabilities (both learning and physical) to ensure that different perspectives were included.51 This included using venues provided by the partner organisations to ensure that a safe and familiar space was created which was fully accessible for all participants. It also meant that the event was carefully planned and tailored to the needs of the participants using staff knowledge to ensure that all the participants would be able to access and deliberate the information being presented to them, and that support was readily available from experienced, well-trained staff.52 Following the four consultation events across the UK, participants were asked to complete feedback. Out of the respondents, 89% rated the event as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ and 83% felt that their views would assist in shaping the committee’s inquiry.53\n\nC Citizens’ Juries\n\nA more deliberative, cyclical form of public engagement is the use of citizens’ juries either as a supplement to conventional parliamentary committee inquiries, or as a pre-legislative or post-legislative form of engagement on a particular policy issue or question. Citizens’ juries typically include a process where a selected group of individuals work together to find an agreement on recommendations that answer their given remit and settle on who they trust to inform, agree regarding themes and priorities, and develop key evaluation criteria for used to judge government, experts, and their own proposals. This involves ‘having everyday citizens identify and explain critical trade-offs with the aim of increasing public trust in potentially controversial recommendations.54\n\nWhen used in a parliamentary setting, this option has the potential to engage citizens and members of a parliament in a long-form deliberative process. For this reason, some consider citizens’ juries to be the international gold standard for deliberative processes. For example, citizens’ juries have been recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\n\n51 Scottish Parliament, Health and Sport Committee, ‘Phase 1 Report: What should primary care\n\nlook like for the next generation?’ (SP Paper 570, 3 July 2019), <https://sp-bpr-en-prodcdnep.azureedge.net/published/HS/2019/7/3/What-should -primary-care-look-like-for-the-next-generation-/HSS052019R9.pdf>.\n\n52 Ibid.\n\n53 Ibid.\n\n54 Laing and Walker (n 9) 10.\n\nVol 5 Sarah Moulds 13\n\nDevelopment and supported by the United Nations Democracy Fund.55 Citizens’ juries have been employed by several local councils and governments within Australia to explore contentious policy issues or policy choices that involve significant trade-offs.56 When used in conjunction with conventional parliamentary committee processes, citizens’ juries provide parliamentary committees with what could be described as an ‘insider view’ as to how citizens may answer the complex policy questions parliamentarians regularly face.\n\nD Mini Publics\n\nAn alternative way to conceptualise citizens’ juries is the idea of a mini-public which is the process of having small groups of randomly selected citizens becoming informed about and deliberating on policy issues. Under this model, witnesses provide evidence to inform participants about the issue, then the participants engage in facilitated deliberation and make recommendations.57 This model was used by six separate House of Commons select committees to develop the Climate Assembly of UK (‘Assembly’),58 which is a citizens’ assembly tasked with ‘providing recommendations on how the UK can achieve the Government’s legally binding target of achieving Net-Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050’.59 The 108-person Assembly was ‘guided through a process of learning, deliberation, and voting by a team of external experts, advocates, and facilitators’.60 An independent evaluation of the Assembly concluded that it was a ‘highly valuable process that enabled a diverse group of UK citizens to engage in parliamentary scrutiny of government on climate\n\n55 See, eg, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Working Party on Open\n\nGovernment ‘Bringing public judgement to democracy: Eight models of representative public deliberation implemented across OECD Member countries’ OECD (OECD Report, GOV/PGC/OG6).\n\n56 See, eg, Nicole Moretto et al, ‘Yes, the government should tax soft drinks: findings from a\n\ncitizens' jury in Australia’, (2014) 11(3) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health 2456; Adriana Parrella et al, ‘Prioritizing government funding of adolescent vaccinations: recommendations from young people on a citizens’ jury’, (2016) 34(31) Vaccine, 3592–3597.\n\n57 See, eg, Chris Riedy and Jenny Kent, ‘Systemic Impacts of Mini-publics. Report prepared for\n\nnew Democracy Foundation’ (Report, Institute for Sustainable Futures, 2017); Claudia Chwalisz, The People's Verdict: Adding Informed Citizen Voices to Public Decision-Making (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2017).\n\n58 Note that the committees referred to are: the House of Commons; the Business Energy and\n\nIndustrial Strategy (BEIS); Environmental Audit; Housing, Communities and Local Government, Science and Technology; Transport; and Treasury.\n\n59 See Stephen Elstub et al, ‘Evaluation of Climate Assembly UK’ (Report, Newcastle\n\nUniversity, 2021).\n\n60 Ibid.\n\n14 University of South Australia Law Review Vol 5\n\npolicy in an informed and meaningful manner’. For the evaluators, the UK Parliament ‘should seek to establish more citizens’ assemblies in the future to feed into the scrutiny work of their select committee system’.61 Mini-publics have also been used by the Scottish Parliament,62 including the Citizens’ Jury on Land Use and Management and the Citizens’ Assembly on Social Care which was commissioned by select committees from the House of Commons. When these experiences were evaluated, the following key recommendations were made about the future use of the mini-public in the parliamentary context:\n\n❖ Provide for a steering group to support the organisation and management of the mini-public to provide diverse evidence and perspectives as well as process independence.\n\n❖ Ensure that evidence is provided to the ‘mini-public' provided by a diverse range of expert witnesses in a diverse range of formats.\n\n❖ Support participants by a neutral expert lead, who can provide training in critical thinking and neutral background information.\n\n❖ Encourage participation by committee members and where appropriate welcome\n\nmembers of the ‘mini-public’ into committee meeting to enhance their sense of value in the process.63\n\nAs with many other deliberative experiments and innovations, mini-publics face many challenges and have been subject to robust evaluation, including by scholars such as Lafont who warns against their use except in very specific circumstances and conditions, arguing that if they are employed more broadly as a form of political decision-making they could diminish, rather than increase, the legitimacy of the deliberative system as a whole.64\n\nE Deliberative Software\n\nNumerous parliaments around the world have employed deliberative software to support more conventional forms of public engagement including parliamentary committee inquiries in conjunction with other deliberative techniques such as citizens’ juries and mini-publics.\n\nLiquidfeedback is an example of deliberative software that was developed in Germany and has been used around Europe by public and private organisations. It is designed to facilitate direct citizen participation in\n\n61 Ibid.\n\n62 Nick Bland, ‘Local solutions to local problems: innovation in public participation’ What\n\nWorks Scotland (Report, May 2017). See also Chwalisz (n 57).\n\n63 See Elstub et al (n 59).\n\n64 Lafont, Cristina, ‘Deliberation, Participation, and Democratic Legitimacy: Should Deliberative\n\nMini-Publics Shape Public Policy?’ (2015) 23(1) The journal of political philosophy 40, 41.\n\nVol 5 Sarah Moulds 15\n\ndemocratic decisions without the need for a parliamentary staff member being a facilitator of online contributions. Liquidfeedback can be used by citizens or parliaments to disseminate information about an idea, policy, or legislative proposal and to test its popularity or merit through a system of feedback and voting.65 It can also be used to generate alternative options as participants can determine whether suggestions from other participants should be implemented into the initiative. Based on these suggestions, Liquidfeedback provides quantified feedback that gives the initiator an idea of how to gain more support.66 Liquidfeedback offers a preferential voting system that allows users to not only vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but also to indicate preferences such as favourites and second choices.67 The voting process determines the collective preference of the participants. The software also enables participants to choose to delegate their vote to someone else that they trust.\n\nDeliberative software like LiquidFeedback has the potential to incorporate elements of direct and representative democracy. Every member can make, comment, and vote on proposals, or delegate their vote to another member who is assumed to be qualified in the respective subject area. The more delegating votes a member gains, the greater the weight of their vote. Some have described deliberative software like Liquidfeedback as contributing to a trend known as the ‘gamification’ of online public engagement strategies.68 In other words, these digital innovations provide participants with the type of visual and psychological rewards that come from other forms of online interactions (such as video gaming), but in the context of deliberative decision-making.\n\nF Voice to Parliament\n\nWhen reflecting on public engagement strategies, Australian parliaments must also reflect on whether they are providing space for self-determined or codesigned engagement to occur, particularly in relation to First Nations peoples.\n\nThe Uluru Statement from the Heart (‘Uluru Statement’) provides the House of Representatives and the Senate with a unique opportunity to explore how to facilitate self-determined engagement with the culture of First Nations people and could prompt experimentation with other ways of\n\n65 Alice K Pieper and Michael Pieper, ‘Political Participation via Social Media: A Case Study\n\nof Deliberative Quality in the Public Online Budgeting Process of Frankfurt/Main, Germany 2013’ (2014) 14(4) Universal access in the information society 487; Christian Blum and Christina I Zuber, ‘Liquid Democracy: Potentials, Problems, and Perspectives’ (2016) 24(2) The Journal of Political Philosophy 162.\n\n66 Ibid.\n\n67 Ibid.\n\n68 See, eg, Ibid.\n\n16 University of South Australia Law Review Vol 5\n\nimproving diversity of membership by creating a more demographically representative Australian Parliament.69\n\nThe Uluru Statement calls for a constitutionally enshrined First Nations Voice to Parliament (‘Voice’) and a Makarrata Commission to supervise a process of agreement-making and truth-telling. The idea of the Voice is a common reform adopted around the world by liberal democracies to improve democratic participation for Indigenous populations. In Australia, the Voice has the potential to empower First Nations people politically. If implemented in the manner set out in the Uluru Statement, it would be a permanent institution for expressing First Nations’ views to the Australian Parliament on important issues affecting First Nations people.70 However, the effectiveness of this type of engagement strategy depends on ensuring its implementation honours the spirit of the Uluru Statement.71 As Appleby and Synot explain, ‘institutional listening relationships that can continue and replicate previous tools of colonial domination’ where the dominant group can give the appearance of listening, but in fact replicate pre-existing power relationships (instead of challenging them) must be avoided if the Voice is to be implemented meaningfully.72\n\nEVALUATING PU BLIC ENGAGEMENT MECHANISMS\n\nEMPLOYED BY AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENTS\n\nIf Australian parliaments are serious about improving the quality and diversity of their public engagement strategies, it is essential that they ask questions about what works, when, and why. This type of evaluation is important even if the assessment is not holistic or suffers from weaknesses in methodology or data inputs because the act of assessing public engagement is an important outward and inward sign that public engagement is valued by a parliament and its staff. Assessing engagement also means that staff members who are actively involved in engagement activities are seen as undertaking a legitimate and\n\n69 See, eg, Gabrielle Appleby and Gemma McKinnon, ‘Indigenous Recognition: The Uluru\n\nStatement’ (2017) 37 Law Society of NSW Journal 36.\n\n70 See, eg, Gabrielle Appleby and Eddie Synot, ‘Constitutional conversation, institutional\n\nlistening and the First Nations Voice’ on AUSPUBLAW (4 March 2021).\n\n71 See, eg, John Parkinson, Núria Franco-Guillén and Sebastian de Laile, ‘Did Australia Listen\n\nto Indigenous People on Constitutional Recognition?

Evaluating engagement tools and strategies is also critical to maintaining best practices through embracing innovation. Quantitative and qualitative data around community engagement is becoming increasingly important for institutional and individual performance within parliaments.\n\nWhile the need for evaluation may be clear, the complex and dynamic nature of parliaments means that evaluating their performance is not always straightforward.73 Many scholars have grappled with these challenges when seeking to evaluate the performance of parliamentary committees in a range of different areas.74 A central complicating factor is how to measure the impact of any particular input or action at the parliamentary end when it comes to interactions by a member of the public with the parliamentary system. For example, if a young person decides to respond to a social media post shared by a parliamentary committee, how can it be determined whether the young person was motivated to respond through social media engagement strategies employed by the committee or other factors (such as the nature of the substantive issue or the young person's lived experience of advocacy)? Similarly, if an e-petition generates 1,000 signatures in favour of legislative change and that legislative change is later enacted by a parliament, how can that parliament measure whether (or to what extent) the e-petition influenced the legislative outcome, rather than some other factor such as a political deal between the government and the crossbench?\n\n73 Meg Russell and Meghan Benton, ‘Assessing the Policy Impact of Parliament:\n\nMethodological Challenges and Possible Future Approaches’ (Conference Paper, Public Service Association Legislative Studies Specialist Group Conference, 24 June 2009), cited in Aileen Kavanagh, ‘The Joint Committee on Human Rights: A Hybrid Breed of Constitutional Watchdog’ in Murray Hunt, Hayley J Hooper and Paul Yowell, Parliaments and Human Rights: Redressing the Democratic Deficit (Hart Publishing, 2015) 131; Michael C Tolley, ‘Parliamentary Scrutiny of Rights in the United Kingdom: Assessing the Work of the Joint Committee on Human Rights’ (2009) 44(1) Australian Journal of Political Science 41; Carolyn Evans and Simon Evans, ‘Legislative Scrutiny Committees and Parliamentary Conceptions of Human Rights’ (2006) 4 Public Law 785; Jennifer Smookler, ‘Making a Difference?

By drawing upon the key elements of past frameworks developed in the context of measuring different aspects of parliamentary performance, it is possible to forge a pathway through some of the seemingly intractable barriers to meaningful measurement.\n\nBy maintaining steady focus on the institutional context and culture in which the engagement takes place, it is possible to generate a risk profile for a particular engagement strategy that is responsive to the past experiences and current resources of a particular parliament or group within the parliament. In addition, through carefully identifying the role, functions, and objectives of the group being sought to engage, it is possible to begin to identify key publics that should form the focus of the engagement strategy, as well as practical limitations such as timeframes and access to digital tools. Then, by explicitly identifying and understanding the key participants within the publics that are the focus on the engagement (including their cultural background and lived experiences relevant to the parliament and the topic of engagement), it is possible to anticipate and reflect upon what engagement strategies will be seen as legitimate,75 accessible, and meaningful by a diverse range of relevant participants.76\n\nWith this context in mind, it is possible to begin to isolate and evaluate different ‘impacts’ arising from the engagement strategy that was employed. The precise nature of these impacts can be refined to respond to the institutional context and purpose of the engagement but may typically include:77 (i) legislative impact (whether the engagement has directly changed the content of a law); (ii) public impact (whether the engagement has influenced public or parliamentary debate on a particular issue or decision); and (iii) hidden impact (whether those working behind the scenes developing or planning laws have changed their practice or approach).\n\n75 See Cristina Leston-Bandeira, ‘The Pursuit of Legitimacy as a Key Driver for Public\n\nEngagement: The European Parliament Case’ (2014) 67(2) Parliamentary Affairs 437.

This is essential to ensure that the appropriate data is collected to enable meaningful evaluation to take place.\n\nSome key questions that should form part of an evaluation toolkit for public engagement with parliaments are set out in the appendix below.\n\nV CONCLUSION\n\nAustralian parliaments have an institutional duty to facilitate representative democracy and preserve the rights of the Australian people to communicate directly with their elected representatives.78 This means embracing techniques that enable parliaments to reach beyond the well-resourced, politically-savvy ‘usual suspects’ when it comes to engaging with the Australian community on matters of public interest. This is critical for Australia’s diverse, modern democracy where geographical location, socio-economic status, and diverse lived experiences can work to marginalise or isolate individuals or communities from the work of parliaments.\n\nIn this context, evaluating engagement strategies and looking for impact beyond the immediate success or failure of a specific technique in the context of a particular inquiry is critical to ensure that Australian parliaments accurately capture the resources required to improve in the future, and to make the case for more investment in the most effective engagement activities.79 This type of reflective practice is particularly important in the immediate aftermath of public crisis or emergency measures such as those employed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.80\n\nThinking outside the box is part of the solution. Parliaments should go out to the people instead of the people having to come into parliaments.81\n\n78 Elaine Thompson, ‘The Senate and Representative Democracy’ (Senate Brief No 10,\n\nParliamentary Library, Parliament of Australia, 1998).\n\n79 Moulds (n 42) chs 8-9.\n\n80 Felix Butzlaff and Sören Messinger-Zimmer, ‘Undermining or Defending Democracy?

However, there is a pressing need to move beyond conventional modes of engagement to reach those who have been ignored or excluded from these processes.82 Developing separate teams of experts and clear strategies and evaluation toolkits can support parliamentary staff to develop appropriate strategies in these areas. By sharing examples of what works across jurisdictions through groups like IPEN and the Australasian Study of Parliament Group, Australian parliaments will continue to fine-tune and innovate their community engagement strategies to better represent the Australian people and their views.\n\nVI APPENDIX: QUESTIONS FOR A PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT\n\nEVALUATION TOOLKIT\n\nPlanning – before engagement commences\n\n❖ Why are we doing this and how will we know if it ‘works’? ❖ Who wants to engage? ❖ Why are we engaging?

    "full_text": "Accountability or Representation? How Electoral Systems Promote Public Trust in African Legislaturesgove_1598 617..637\n\nWONBIN CHO*\n\nElections serve as instruments of democracy, but they do so differently in various parts of the world. This article focuses on the democratizing role of elections in 16 sub-Saharan African countries represented in Afrobarometer survey data. It traces conﬁdence in legislative institutions to whether a citizen perceives competitive elections to produce accountability and/or representation. The analysis shows that elections function differently depending on the nature of legislative institutions. Majoritarian electoral systems promote a sense of citizen control over policymakers (i.e., accountability) whereas proportional representation (PR) systems increase the perception of inclusion across a society’s factions (i.e., representation). Because sub-Saharan African citizens typically prioritize representation rather than accountability when evaluating their legislative institutions, controlling for other inﬂuences, PR systems are much better at boosting public trust in the region. These ﬁndings have important implications for democratic development in Africa.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCitizens’ political support for important government institutions such as legislatures is critical for achieving stability in emerging democracies (Bratton, Mattes, and Gyimah-Boadi 2005; Easton 1965; Norris 1999). Citizens put their trust in political institutions based on their evaluations of the performance of those institutions (March 1988; Mishler and Rose 2001; Norris 1999). More speciﬁcally, citizens judge a legislature according to whether it provides what people want and whether it provides a reasonably fair chance for them to inﬂuence decision-making processes through periodic multiparty elections. Different electoral systems have different mechanics for allowing citizens to express their interests. Without knowing how ordinary citizens understand the mechanics of a given electoral system, we are hardly able to understand how they build their trust in the legislature. Elections establish the connection between citizens and policymakers in a democracy. They are the means through which citizens encourage\n\n*Sungkyunkwan University\n\nGovernance: An International Journal of Policy, Administration, and Institutions, Vol. 25, No. 4, October 2012 (pp. 617–637). © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. doi:10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x\n\npolicymakers to pay attention to their interests. However, institutional designs differ in the vision of representation that they promote. Some emphasize accountability (Barkan 1998; Horowitz 1991, 2003; Reilly 1997; Sartori 1997) whereas others emphasize representativeness (Lijphart 1999, 2004; Powell 2000; Reynolds 1999; Shugart and Wattenberg 2000). While the former uses elections as an instrument for citizens’ direct control over policymakers, the latter argues that elections should increase broad participation in government and broad agreement on policies. Electoral system can be broadly classiﬁed into two types: majoritarian electoral systems and proportional representation (PR) systems. Majoritarian systems most often use single-member districts. In this system, voters cast a vote for an individual candidate, and the candidate receiving the most votes is the winner (winner take all). On the other hand, a PR system is an electoral system in which voters cast their votes for political parties, and the percentage of the vote that each party receives translates into the percentage of seats that the party receives in the legislature. Majoritarian electoral systems help promote accountability with the winner-take-all system. They usually offer voters a clear-cut choice between two major parties at the national level, and the national vote clearly translates into winning and losing parties. Majoritarian electoral systems in turn produce legislative bodies that are especially reﬂective of the wishes of the majority but may neglect the goal of representativeness by excluding smaller groups from meaningful participation. Systems that distribute legislative seats proportionally, meanwhile, ensure broader representativeness in the legislature but may fracture power to such an extent that leaders fail to achieve compromise policy solutions, and the majority cannot hold the leadership sufﬁciently accountable (Cox 1997; Katz 1997; Lijphart 1994; Norris 2004; Reynolds 1999). These differences in institutional priorities pose an interesting dilemma when theorizing about how legislative institutions might promote public trust. The electoral system may shape people’s evaluation of institutions themselves (Anderson and Guillory 1997; Cho and Bratton 2006; Criado and Herreros 2007). Speciﬁcally, individual citizens may not expect the same degree of either accountability or responsiveness from all legislatures, but they may instead judge the democratic system according to its success promoting the values underlying it. A majoritarian system likely will generate trust when it succeeds at providing accountability. Under such a system, citizens who perceive an ability to control their members of parliament (MPs) directly through voting would in turn show higher levels of trust in the legislature. A PR system, on the other hand, might generate trust according to its success at being representative. It brings into the policymaking arena representative agents from all factions of society who then bargain with each other in a ﬂexible and accommodative fashion. In other words, electoral institutions would mediate how citizens translate their judgments of legislative performance into overall trust in the legislative branch itself.\n\n618 WONBIN CHO\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025].

It examines the impact of citizens’ perceptions of accountability and representation on their conﬁdence in the legislature, using Afrobarometer survey data collected from 16 sub-Saharan African countries with country context indicators—but then allows the relationship between those perceptions and overall conﬁdence to depend upon the type of electoral system present in each country. After controlling for a variety of individual- and country-level characteristics, I found that African citizens typically value the representation function of elections more than their accountability roles when they judge the legislature. Moreover, PR systems are much better at boosting the public trust in the legislature than are majoritarian electoral systems when citizens believe that elections actually improve their political representation. These ﬁndings have important implications for democratic development in Africa. They help us to understand how ordinary citizens build their trust in the institutions that are intended to represent them, as high levels of trust enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic government in emerging democracies.\n\nPublic Trust in the Legislature\n\nHow do ordinary citizens build their conﬁdence in the legislature, particularly in Africa’s emerging democracies? High levels of trust in political institutions contribute to legitimating, and thus consolidating, democracy. Low levels of institutional trust tend to force political elites to face a difﬁcult environment to carry out their agenda. Several studies show the evidence of a direct relationship between institutional trust and democratic legitimacy for emerging democracies (Bratton, Mattes, and GyimahBoadi 2005; Rose, Mishler, and Haerpfer 1998). Three theoretical traditions (cultural theories, theories of government performance, and institutional theories) attempt to explain the origins of institutional trust, and they provide very different perspectives on how ordinary citizens develop high levels of trust in political institutions (Mishler and Rose 2001; Norris 1999). Cultural theories emphasize the role of deep-rooted cultural norms and individual’s socialization experiences (Almond and Verba 1963; Inglehart 1997; Putnam 1993). Individuals learn to trust or distrust other people by interacting with family members, friends, and formal social networks from their early youth. This socialization process results in a collective sense of interpersonal trust in a given society, and high levels of interpersonal trust are strongly associated with high levels of institutional trust. However, Mishler and Rose (2001) ﬁnd few empirical results supporting the cultural explanations with the survey data from 10 post communist countries. Theories of government performance focus on the effects of either public evaluation of government performance or objective indicators of economic performance on institutional trust (Anderson and Guillory\n\nINSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY? 619\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025].

The high quality of policy outcomes and improvement in economic evaluations lead ordinary citizens to perceive government to be working effectively. These positive perceptions result in increased institutional trust. In addition to economic outcomes, political outcomes—such as removing restrictions on individual liberty, providing increased freedoms, and reducing corruption— contribute to high levels of institutional trust, particularly in emerging democracies. While I found a signiﬁcant amount of research about the inﬂuence of government performance, these studies do not agree about the most appropriate way to compare government performance, and existing empirical studies show inconsistent results. For example, Mishler and Rose (2001) ﬁnd strong evidence supporting the perspective of institutional performance, but McAllister (1999) and Miller and Listhaug (1999) show that the impact of government performance on institutional conﬁdence is not signiﬁcant. One group of scholars emphasizes the inﬂuence of political institutions on levels of public trust in institutions (Anderson et al. 2005; Cho and Bratton 2006; Criado and Herreros 2007; Norris 1999). The variation in public trust in institutions across countries seems due to characteristics of political institutions such as electoral systems, executive types, and party systems. The direct effects on popular attitudes toward political institutions vary in different studies. Norris (1999), for example, ﬁnds that countries with majoritarian electoral systems have higher levels of institutional conﬁdence than ones with proportional electoral systems in her crossnational analysis. However, Anderson et al. (2005) and Cho and Bratton (2006) show that more proportional electoral systems increase citizens’ conﬁdence in the political system. Focusing on country-level political institutions helps scholars understand the various levels of citizens’ institutional conﬁdence across countries. However, those discrepancies in empirical results suggest that the issues of the effects of institutions on institutional conﬁdence remain understudied. Instead of direct effects, political institutions have indirect (or mediate) effects between popular evaluation of institutional performance and institutional trust. To understand how ordinary citizens develop their trust, this article combines two existing bodies of knowledge: theories of government performance and institutional theories. The effects of citizens’ perception of institutional performance on their levels of institutional trust can be mediated by the impact of political institutions. At a basic level, public trust in a given institution is an evaluative orientation focused on how well the institution is operating according to some normative expectation (Mishler and Rose 2001; Stokes 1962). In addition, the same democratic institutions can have different effects on citizens’ attitudes toward political systems (Cho 2010). Combining the individual- and country-level effects on public trust in institutions further advances my understanding of the relationship among citizens and the government.\n\n620 WONBIN CHO\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nIn contrast to previous studies focusing on citizens’ trust in institutions generally (Mishler and Rose 2001; Norris 1999), my research emphasizes a speciﬁc institution—exploring how citizens’ perceptions of the performance of multiparty elections affect their levels of trust in the legislature. Individual evaluations of the performance of a given institution are based on their experiences and thoughts, for example, whether they perceive that individuals are able to vote for the candidate that represents them best when casting votes in a general election. Emphasizing the mechanism of a speciﬁc institution can help us to increase my understanding of how key political institutions shape citizens’ attitudes toward those institutions and its political consequences. Weakness of legislatures is a common phenomenon in Africa (Barkan 2009; van de Walle 2003). The legislature, however, is the embodiment of the sovereignty of the people. In addition to its legislative role, the legislature is expected to serve both as an agency of restraint on the executive branch of government and as a public arena for the mobilization of popular participation in the broad governmental decision-making process. The legislature itself represents an institution that captures the diversity of society. When legislatures were introduced as a political institution, in turn, they were supposed to have a signiﬁcant role in the establishing and consolidation of democracy in the region. Thus, the legislature still effectively shapes political debates in a handful of country (Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda), and democratic politics still revolves to a varying extent around their most representative bodies (Barkan 2009). For that reason, my article attempts to understand the legitimacy of African legislatures from the ordinary citizens’ perspective. The legitimacy of the legislature depends heavily on whether citizens approve the work their lawmakers are doing and, therefore, how the legislature inﬂuences the development of democracy. This public trust in institutions is generally beneﬁcial—and sometimes necessary—for the success of democratic governments (Gibson and Caldeira 1995; Hetherington 1998).\n\nElections for MPs: Accountability and Representation\n\nWhat determines the levels of popular trust in legislature? First, my article focuses on how popular perception of multiparty elections affects conﬁdence in the legislature. Between 1990 and 2006, 44 of the 48 sub-Saharan African countries introduced multiparty electoral competition (Bratton and van de Walle 1997; Lindberg 2006). As observed after the 2007–2008 Kenyan postelection violence, a signiﬁcant number of African elites and some scholars still argue that multiparty elections exacerbate ethnic conﬂicts and polarize societies in the region (LeBas 2006; Sisk and Reynolds 1998). However, multiparty elections are the means for connecting ordinary voters with political elites. In emerging democracies, voting might be the only peaceful way for citizens to express their preferences and to inﬂuence decision making at the national level. Therefore, it is critical for\n\nINSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY? 621\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nvoters to perceive how those elections enable them to inﬂuence government decision-making processes and be fairly represented by the rules of their country’s electoral system. I then examine whether the effects of popular evaluations of electoral performance are dependent on various types of electoral systems. There is no consensus on what kind of electoral system is better for political accommodation and stability in emerging democracies. A group of scholars strongly recommends majoritarian electoral systems, which should motivate parties to approach moderate positions (Barkan 1998; Horowitz 1991, 2003; Reilly 1997; Sartori 1997). Others recommend a system of PR to allow minority parties to gain representation in the legislature (Lijphart 1999, 2004; Powell 2000; Reynolds 1999; Shugart and Wattenberg 2000). Powell (2000) distinguishes between two visions of elections as “instruments of democracy”: accountability and representation. Accountability models try to use elections directly to inﬂuence policymakers. Under this model, citizens appear to be more suspicious of the autonomy of elected representatives and are more likely to trust elected ofﬁcials who are accountable to voters. Furthermore, they seem more likely to see elections as a periodic opportunity to change unsatisfactory policymakers. Additionally, the accountability model argues that anticipation of possible rejection shapes the policies of the incumbents. Competitive elections create pressure on all incumbents to worry about the next elections and to make policy with voter review in mind. During the election campaign, MPs clamor for personal votes, and they are more inclined to seek out regular contact with individual voters. Citizens, meanwhile, like to pinpoint responsibility for policymaking and exercise direct control over determining the policymakers. When voters feel that they have the ability to reward or punish elected ofﬁcials in elections, their resulting conﬁdence seems to shape their positive attitudes toward the legislature as a group of individual MPs who are expected to represent their constituents’ interests (Hypothesis 1). On the other hand, the representation model emphasizes that citizens should be treated equally at the decisive stage of public policymaking. This model argues that democracy should require PR of the full range of citizen opinion, not just an electoral majority opinion. In the representation model, citizens seem to be more suspicious of majorities (especially those created by elections), less worried about the autonomy of policymakers (so long as citizens have had a role in selecting them), and less worried about negotiated inaction. Elections are instruments of citizen inﬂuence, not direct control. Elections should create equitable reﬂection of all points of view in the legislature. They work as an instrument to choose representatives who can bargain for their voters’ interests in postelection policymaking. While the accountability model uses elections as a one-stage device to locate the true majority position, the representation model emphasizes the bargain process of representatives to ﬁnd the most preferred policy after the elections. This model, therefore, suggests that\n\n622 WONBIN CHO\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025].

Electoral systems are conventionally divided into two categories, majoritarian and PR (Lijphart 1999). Majoritarian systems usually employ exclusively single-seat districts with plurality rule and tend to give greater representation to the two largest parties. PR systems must employ multiseat districts, usually with party lists, and typically produce a high degree of proportionality between a party’s vote share and its seat share in parliamentary. PR systems are more representative than majoritarian because they make it easier for smaller parties to win seats in parliament. Majoritarian electoral systems are more common in sub-Saharan Africa than PR systems.1\n\nElectoral institutions not only affect the nature of the democratic process but also seem to shape public attitudes toward political systems (Cho and Bratton 2006; Norris 1999). Under PR systems, all political parties have a right to equal expression, regardless of their relative size (Lijphart 1999; Powell 2000). The Namibian National Assembly, a PR system, ensures that small parties such as the National Unity Democratic Organization, the United Democratic Front, the Republican Party, and the Monitor Action Group, each of which has less than 5% of the vote, have a voice in government. By allowing small ethnic parties into the parliament, in addition, the PR systems encourage such parties to work within the system rather than seek to overthrow it. Therefore, PR systems obviously have a greater impact on popular perceptions of MP’s political representation. PR systems, furthermore, have as their hallmark the faithful translation of votes cast into seats won; this allows parties with a small number of votes to gain legislative representation and minimizes “unfair” representation of the larger parties. If electoral thresholds are low and district magnitudes are reasonably large, almost all votes cast in PR systems can be translated into seats in the legislature. In PR systems, on the other hand, voters choose between parties, not candidates, and have little ability to mandate the elected ofﬁcials. Elected ofﬁcials’ reelection chances depend mainly on where the candidate selectors, not voters, place them within the party list. Because PR systems are more complex than majoritarian systems, they are more likely to confuse voters. The voters may not be entirely certain of how their votes are counted into seats in the parliament, and they may end up with a government very different from the one imagined. I expect that the effect on trust of popular evaluations of the representation mechanism should be higher in PR systems than in majoritarian electoral systems (Hypothesis 3a).\n\nINSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY? 623\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nWhen people evaluate the government decision-making process, they stress its ability to perform in the interests of all citizens. A ﬁrst-past-thepost (FPTP) electoral system, as a typical example of majoritarian electoral systems, can provide a clear-cut choice for voters between two main parties, and it is likely to give rise to single-party government and a coherent parliamentary opposition in the legislature. Under FPTP, voters know better who their own representative is and have the ability to reelect, or throw him/her out. An elected ofﬁcial’s belief that chances of reelection depend signiﬁcantly on voter evaluations of individual performance builds individual accountability of the MPs. Under FPTP, on the other hand, legislative representation will capture voter preferences less accurately. A signiﬁcant number of votes cast for losing candidates are “wasted,” and voters can merely say “yes” to one candidate and “no” to the rest. Because majoritarian electoral systems are designed to promote citizens’ direct control over policymakers, I expect that citizens in countries with majoritarian electoral systems are much more likely than those in PR systems to base their conﬁdence in the legislature on perceptions of their ability to replace electoral ofﬁcials (Hypothesis 3b).\n\nData and Methods\n\nThis article mainly draws upon individual-level survey data collected by the Afrobarometer in 16 sub-Saharan Africa countries2 between March 2005 and March 2006. The data are derived from national probability samples that range in size from 1,161 in Lesotho to 2,400 in South Africa, Nigeria, and Uganda. Those 16 countries have had a founding election (or a redemocratizing election) and some degrees of political liberalization. The results thus cannot be seen as representative of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole: They are among the continent’s most liberalized regimes.\n\nDependent Variable\n\nThe dependent variable in this article is the level of conﬁdence that people place in the legislature. Respondents were asked: “How much do you trust the parliament?” The response options were not at all (= 0), just a little (= 1), somewhat (= 2), and a lot (= 3). Figure 1 shows the distribution of mean values of the dependent variables across countries included in this article. On the average, countries score 1.71 on a four-point scale for public trust in the legislature. The graph shows considerable cross-national variation in popular trust in the legislature. Speciﬁcally, the mean values of trust in the legislature range from 0.82 in Nigeria all the way to 2.39 in Mozambique.\n\nIndependent Variables\n\nI use two types of independent variables in the model: at the country level and at the individual level. My model has two independent variables at\n\n624 WONBIN CHO\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nthe individual level: accountability and representation. The variable accountability measures whether the respondent believes that elections “enable voters to remove from ofﬁce leaders who do not do what the people want.” On average, 54% of respondents think that elections “well” or “very well” offer them a periodic opportunity to change the elected ofﬁcials. The variable representation measures whether respondent perceives that elections “ensure that the members of Parliament reﬂect the views of voters.” On average, 53% of respondents believe that elections “well” or “very well” bring the representations of all points of view into the government decision-making process.3 I expect that these two individuallevel independent variables should have a positive effect on public trust in the legislature. I also added a variable of mean district magnitude (MDM) for electoral systems at the country level. This variable as a measure of the proportionality of the electoral system allows us to introduce wide variation in district magnitude within the PR group in the sample. I am speciﬁcally interested in the degree of relationship between public perceptions of accountability, and their conﬁdence in the parliament is contingent upon electoral systems. To test this hypothesis, I add a crosslevel interaction term—accountability ¥ MDM—into the models. I expect that the interaction term should have a negative coefﬁcient. In other words, the higher proportionality of electoral systems is expected to mitigate the positive effects of popular perceptions of accountability on their conﬁdence in the parliament. My model has an additional cross-level interaction term—representation ¥ MDM—to test if a more proportional electoral system is likely to reinforce the positive relationship between popular perceptions of MPs’ political representation and popular trust in\n\nFIGURE 1 Public Trust in the Legislature across 16 Sub-Saharan Countries\n\nSource: Afrobarometer Round3.\n\nINSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY? 625\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nthe legislature. I expect that the interaction term should have a positive coefﬁcient.\n\nControl Variables\n\nThe model also includes a series of control variables that would have an impact on popular trust in the legislature. The control variables can again be divided into country-level and individual-level variables. At the country level, I include two control variables: the effective number of political parties (ENPP) and the levels of democratization (a reversed average score of political right and civil liberties of Freedom House Index 2005).4 Variations in party systems should shape citizens’ conﬁdence in legislature. Greater ENPP means that voters have more reliable options to choose in elections. If those parties are strongly linked with a voter’s ethnic group, it will increase popular trust in the parliament. While most African legislatures have a weak inﬂuence on the government decision-making process in relation to the executive, the extent of legislative capacity signiﬁcantly varies across countries (Barkan 2009). The development of the legislature may be dependent on individual country’s experience of democratization. The levels of democratization, in turn, shape public trust in the legislature. The information on political institutions of 16 countries included in this article is shown in Appendix A. A number of individual-level variables are also used to control for attitudinal and demographic factors. In Africa, the neopatrimonial system signiﬁcantly marginalizes the role of the legislature in government decision-making process (Barkan 2009; van de Walle 2003). If respondents have a positive attitude about the president’s (the chief executive) dominant power in policymaking process, I expect that they should have lower levels of trust in the legislature. The quality of elections should matter for citizens to express their conﬁdence in the legislature (Lindberg 2006). Whether MPs are elected by free and fair elections has a signiﬁcant impact on the legitimacy of the legislature. People who highly rate the freeness and fairness of the national elections are more likely to express high levels of trust in the legislature. Ethnic politics is one of the prominent factors in Africa. In many cases, moreover, multiparty elections lead to the formation of ethnic parties instead of ideological or programmatic parties (Sisk and Reynolds 1998). How to represent the interest of minority ethnic groups into the political system should have a signiﬁcant effect on the legitimacy of the legislature. Because numerous studies ﬁnd that perceptions of the economy inﬂuence attitudes about political institutions’ performance (Anderson and Guillory 1997; Weatherford 1992), I include two measures of economic performance evaluation: one based on personal (egocentric) economic conditions and a second based on perceived national (sociotropic) economic conditions.\n\n626 WONBIN CHO\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nFinally, to control for party afﬁliations, this article includes an individual’s identiﬁcation with ruling political parties (winner). Multiparty elections produce winners and losers among voters in terms of whether they cast vote for the governing party or not. Existing studies ﬁnd that winners are likely to express higher levels of trust in institutions (Anderson et al. 2005; Cho and Bratton 2006; Norris 1999). I also control for age, education, gender, and urban or rural habitation. Coding processes for the individual-level variables used in this article and the descriptive statistics are shown in Appendix B.\n\nMultilevel Analysis\n\nTo explore the different levels of citizens’ conﬁdence in the parliament, the data set for this article is constructed with both individual- and countrylevel variables. Due to the multilevel structure of data set—survey respondents are nested within countries—I estimate my model using multilevel analysis (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002). A multilevel model is a type of regression model that is particularly suitable for such a data set. In contrast to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, the equation of this multilevel model in this article has two error terms: one for individual level and one for country level. In addition, the OLS regression model creates a number of statistical problems, including underestimating the standard errors for country-level predictors, which constitute key independent variables in this article. OLS also assumes that there is constant variance and no clustering across countries. Multilevel analysis, in contrast, allows us to estimate a model with varying intercepts and slopes between countries in this article, and provides for a direct estimation of variance components at both levels of the model (Steenbergen and Jones 2002).\n\nResults\n\nTo test for signiﬁcant variation in public trust in the legislature at the individual and country levels, ﬁrst, I estimate an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model decomposing the variance in the dependent variable between the two different levels of analysis. This ANOVA model is important because it provides the basic partition of the variability of the dependent variable in the data set between the two levels. If both variance components are statistically signiﬁcant, I can argue that both levels of analysis are important. For example, when I estimate the ANOVA model for public conﬁdence in the legislature, both variance components are statistically signiﬁcant,5 suggesting that there is signiﬁcant variance in public conﬁdence in the parliament at both levels. The results of the ANOVA model clearly suggest that I should take factors from both individual and country level into account to fully understand the levels of public trust in the legislature.\n\nINSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY? 627\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nTherefore, I ﬁrst examine the independent effects of two public perceptions about how elections work in practice in their country (accountability and representation) on their trust in the legislature. I then estimate a model with all two variables and two cross-level interaction terms (accountability ¥ MDM and representation ¥ MDM) together to understand their relative effects better. Table 1 presents the results of these models. Model 1 includes two individual-level independent variables: one measuring popular perceptions of their ability to replace electoral ofﬁcials (accountability) and one measuring popular perceptions of the political representation of MPs. The results show that the variable of accountability does not have any signiﬁcant effects on popular trust in the legislature. Whether or not citizens believe that they can use elections to reward or punish their elected ofﬁcials is not a signiﬁcant factor when they express levels of trust in the legislature. The results suggest that periodic multiparty elections do not offer any practical control for ordinary people to select a better performing candidate for the seat in the legislatures. Elections do not work as one aspect of democratic instruments: the accountability mechanism. Even after introducing multiparty elections, we have still observed one-party dominance and few cases of executive power turnover in many countries. The prevalence of ethnically based parties also limits voter’s choice on a ballot in the region. Voters can merely say “yes” to their co-ethnic candidate and “no” to the rest. On the other hand, the variable measuring popular perceptions of the political representation of MPs has a positive and statistically signiﬁcant effect on the levels of trust in the legislature. This result is consistent with my hypothesis saying that citizens who feel that elections enhance MPs’ political representation are more likely to express high levels of trust in the legislature. It suggests that multiparty elections do work as one aspect of democratic instruments: the representation mechanism. After democratic transition, multiparty elections signiﬁcantly increased the number of parties, small ethnic parties in particular, in the legislature. For example, Benin currently has 12 parties in the National Assembly, Kenya has 10 parties, and South Africa has 12 parties. Having their preferred party in the legislature due to multiparty elections, voters feel that their voice will be heard, and their particular interests will be represented in the government decision-making processes. In addition, most of the other individual-level control variables are statistically signiﬁcant, and in some cases, the effects are quite substantial. In particular, people who have positive attitudes toward dominant presidential legislative power are less likely to express their conﬁdence in parliament. Compared to the president, ordinary people still believe that the legislature possesses relatively weak power in the policymaking process and in the operations of the state.

I also note that the quality of elections has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on public trust in the legislature. This suggests that the quality of the election should have a signiﬁcant role for ordinary citizens to evaluate the performance of the legislature. Free and fair elections contribute to boost the legitimacy of the legislature. I ﬁnd that people who feel that their own ethnic group is treated unfairly by the government are more likely to show lower levels of trust in the legislature. One of the main roles of the legislature is to represent the various and conﬂicting interests of the society as a whole; those ethnic groups marginalized from the government decision-making process are very likely to express their distrust in the legislature. Public perceptions of economic performance also matters: Higher ratings of national and personal economic conditions are associated with more optimistic assessments about the parliament’s performance. Consistent with existing studies (Anderson and Guillory 1997; Hetherington 1998; Mishler and Rose 2001; Weatherford 1992), ordinary Africans tend to build their own levels of trust in political institutions based on their evaluation of economic performance. The results also show that citizens who identify with parties in power (“winners”) reveal higher trust in the legislature than those who support opposition parties. Multiparty elections result in both winners and losers, deﬁned by whether voters support a party in the government or not. People in the political majority should be more positive about how the political system works. Meanwhile, the more urbanized and educated respondents exhibit lower levels of trust in the legislature. Both urban dwellers and highly educated citizens are likely to have more information on the government decision-making process, and they are more critical of how the political system works in this region. Age and gender have no signiﬁcant effect on public trust in the legislature. None of three country-level predictors is statistically signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level in model 1. The 16 countries included in this article are among the most liberalized ones on this continent. The statistical insigniﬁcance of the country-level variable of democratization may be due to the small variance across the 16 countries. Interestingly, the results show that electoral systems do not have any direct impact on public trust in the legislature, a conclusion not consistent with existing studies (Cho and Bratton 2006; Norris 1999). Model 2 includes two cross-level interaction terms to understand more clearly in what way electoral systems matter for increasing public trust in the legislature. I hypothesized that the impact of popular perceptions of either accountability or MPs’ political representation on public trust in the legislature may be contingent upon electoral systems. The ﬁrst argument tested in model 2 is whether the effect of the evaluation of the accountability mechanism of elections on public trust in the legislature is lager in those countries with a more majoritarian electoral system. Under\n\n630 WONBIN CHO\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025].

The results of model 2 show the cross-level interaction term between public perceptions of accountability, and MDM is not statistically signiﬁcant at a conventional level. I found no evidence suggesting that citizens in countries with majoritarian electoral systems are much more likely than those in PR systems to base their conﬁdence in the legislature on perceptions of their ability to replace policymakers. Electoral systems designed to directly connect voters and political elites do not successfully boost ordinary citizens’ perceptions of the accountability mechanism and their trust in the legislature in the region. The second argument tested in model 2 is whether the impact of popular evaluation of MPs’ political representation on public trust in the legislature is higher in countries with PR systems than in countries with majoritarian electoral systems. The coefﬁcient of the cross-level interaction term between popular perceptions of MPs’ representation and MDM is positive and statistically signiﬁcant at conventional level. The results indicate that PR electoral systems are better than majoritarian systems when it comes to boosting public conﬁdence in the legislature when citizens feel that elections enhance MPs’ political representation. This suggests that the type of electoral system should matter for citizens to evaluate the performance of political institutions. Under PR systems, as we expect, citizens perceive that their views and opinions are equally treated within the system, and even smaller parties can easily win seats in the legislature. This inclusive feature of PR systems encourages minority groups and small parties to work within the political system and in turn contributes to increase public trust in the legislature.\n\nConclusion\n\nElections—especially free and fair, competitive, and multiparty elections—are a critical component of democratization in emerging democracies. While an election can intensify the polarization of a society along ethnic lines, competitive elections can force political elites to legitimate their rule through the ballot box. However, it has not been clearly answered whether and how multiparty elections work as instruments of democracy in emerging African democracies. Moreover, we are still debating about how elections serve to link voters and elected ofﬁcials. While one group of scholars emphasizes the directness and clarity of the connection between voters and policymakers, others point to representation of all factions in society. My article explores how ordinary Africans perceive those two different mechanisms (accountability and representation) of elections in practice and whether the public evaluation of electoral performance shapes their levels of trust in the legislature.\n\nINSTRUMENTS OF DEMOCRACY? 631\n\n14680491, 2012, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01598.x by Iscte, Wiley Online Library on [04/06/2025].

Citizens who positively perceive that elections ensure that MPs reﬂect the views of voters are likely to express higher levels of trust in the legislature. The results also show that the effect of popular perceptions about the degree of representation of MPs on their conﬁdence in the legislature depends on the type of electoral system. PR systems work better for boosting the positive effects of MPs’ political representation on public trust in the legislature than majoritarian systems do. On the other hand, I found no evidence indicating that the effect of popular perceptions about their ability to replace electoral ofﬁcials on their conﬁdence in the legislature is greater in countries with majoritarian electoral systems than in countries with PR systems. The results show that elections are not fully developed as instruments of democracy in Africa. Elections are instruments of citizen inﬂuence, not direct control, over their representatives. Elections help voters to send MPs representing their interests to the parliament to some extent. However, voters do not believe that they have a controlling ability to reward or punish elected ofﬁcials in periodic elections based on their performance in the ofﬁce. While the continent has undergone a series of multiparty elections and a signiﬁcant number of countries have experienced power alternations as a result of their founding election, legislator turnover has in fact been a relatively infrequent occurrence after the founding election. This pattern of one-party dominance in the region is consistent with my ﬁnding. Public support is one of the necessary conditions for the development of political institutions in democracies. While the legislature usually has a weak power in relation to the executive in young democracies, its legislative capacity and inﬂuence on government decision-making process varies greatly from country to country. This article clearly shows a signiﬁcant variance in the levels of public trust in the legislature across 16 sub-Saharan countries. Focusing on public trust in the legislature can help us to understand why the legislatures in some countries are able to increase their legislative power while those in others are not. Multiparty elections constitute a principal avenue for citizens to become involved in the policymaking process. Understanding their effects on public trust in the legislature and the role of the individual therein has important implications for theories of democratic governance in emerging democracies.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Among respondents who believe that elections “well” provide them a chance to change the elected ofﬁcials, only 62% of them think that elections “well” facilitate MPs’ political representation in the legislature. 4. I tried to include two other country-level control variables (the rate of growth in GDP per capita 2005 and ethnic fractionalization index) into the model. I found no signiﬁcant difference in the empirical results. Neither of them has any signiﬁcant impact on public trust in the legislature. Three country-level predictors are enough for a multilevel analysis with only 16 countries. 5.

Yet the current drive shows no signs of abating. In 2016 came the indictments of key actors in the infamous Tegeta Escrow scandal, as well as of the head of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (Tanzanian Affairs, 2017). The drive has also focused on petty corruption, with the suspension or dismissal of public officials and changes in key personnel in most law enforcement agencies. In addition to launching Phase III (2017-2022) of its National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan (United Republic of Tanzania, 2017), the government has established the Economic, Corruption and Organised Crime Division of the High Court (John, 2016). and the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) recently reported recovering some US$ 26.9 million in public monies during the past two financial years (Xinhua, 2017).\n\nThese intensified efforts against corruption in Tanzania have begun to pay dividends in public opinion, a recent Afrobarometer/Transparency International survey suggests. Improvements in the government’s handling of corruption in public office appear to have reduced citizens’ perceptions of institutional corruption in key public agencies. Still, fighting public corruption remains a challenge in Tanzania, in part due to fear of retaliation against people who report it.\n\nThe survey results suggest that government efforts against corruption have produced notable gains, but more needs to be done to promote the participation of the public in the fight against corruption.\n\nAfrobarometer survey\n\nAfrobarometer is a pan-African, non-partisan research network that conducts public attitude surveys on democracy, governance, economic conditions, and related issues in African countries. Six rounds of surveys were conducted in up to 37 countries between 1999 and 2016, and Round 7 surveys are being conducted in 2016/2018. Afrobarometer conducts face-to-face interviews in the language of the respondent’s choice with nationally representative samples.\n\nCopyright ©Afrobarometer 2017 2\n\nThe Afrobarometer team in Tanzania, led by REPOA, interviewed 2,400 adult Tanzanians in May 2017. A sample of this size yields country-level results with a margin of error of +/-2 at a 95% confidence level. The survey module on corruption was supported by Transparency International.\n\nPrevious surveys were conducted in Tanzania in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2012, and 2014.\n\nKey findings\n\n▪ More than seven in 10 respondents (72%) say the level of corruption in Tanzania has\n\ndecreased “somewhat” or “a lot” over the past year. This is a sharp reversal from 2014, when only 13% reported a decrease. ▪ Similarly, seven in 10 Tanzanians (71%) say the government is fighting corruption “fairly\n\nwell” or “very well” – almost twice the level of approval in 2014 (37%). Among respondents who have heard of the PCCB, 83% describe its work as “somewhat effective” (59%) or “very effective” (24%). ▪ Popular perceptions of corruption in key public institutions have declined across the\n\nboard. While 37% of respondents considered “most” or “all” Tanzania Revenue Authority officials corrupt in 2014, the proportion dropped to 14% in 2017. PCCB officials, local and national government officials, the police, judges, members of Parliament, and Presidency officials also enjoyed double-digit improvements in public perceptions of corruption. ▪ Despite these gains, substantial proportions of Tanzanians still see corruption in their\n\npublic institutions. More than one-third (36%) say most/all police officials are corrupt, while one-fifth (21%) say the same about judges and magistrates. ▪ Seven in 10 Tanzanians (71%) say people fear adverse consequences if they report\n\ncorruption incidents to the authorities, and only half (50%) think that ordinary citizens can make a difference in the fight against corruption.\n\nSteep decline in levels of perceived corruption\n\nSeven in 10 Tanzanians (72%) say the level of corruption in the country has decreased over the past year, including 21% who say it has decreased “a lot” (Figure 1). This is a remarkable turnaround from 2014, when more than two-thirds (67%) of respondents reported that corruption had increased during the previous year.\n\nNotably, the decline in perceived corruption is accompanied by a doubling of the level of satisfaction with the government’s handling of corruption. Seven in 10 Tanzanians (71%) say their government is performing “fairly well” or “very well” in fighting corruption in government, compared to 37% in 2014 (Figure 2).\n\nThe public’s satisfaction with anti-corruption efforts may be driven in part by perceptions of the effectiveness of Tanzania’s anti-corruption agency, PCCB. Two-thirds of respondents say they have heard “a little bit” (15%), “some” (22%), or “a lot” (32%) about the PCCB and its responsibilities. Of those who know about the PCCB, fully 83% describe its work as “somewhat effective” (59%) or “very effective” (24%), while only 11% say it is ineffective (Figure 3).\n\nDo your own analysis of Afrobarometer data –\n\non any question, for any country and survey\n\nround.

(Note: Figure shows only responses of those who say they have heard of the PCCB.)\n\nDeclining corruption in key public institutions\n\nThe government’s efforts against corruption appear to be paying dividends in declining perceptions of corruption in government (Table 1). Across eight key public institutions, the proportion of respondents who say that “most” or “all” of these officials are corrupt declined by between 13 and 23 percentage points between 2014 and 2017.\n\nTable 1: Changes in citizens’ perceptions of corruption in government institutions | Tanzania | 2014-2017\n\nMost/All are corrupt Change 2014-2017 (percentage points) 2014 2017\n\nTanzania Revenue Authority 37% 14% -23\n\nPrevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) 29% 11% -18\n\nLocal government councillors 25% 10% -15\n\nPolice 50% 36% -14\n\nJudges and magistrates 35% 21% -14\n\nGovernment officials 25% 12% -13\n\nMembers of Parliament 21% 8% -13\n\nOffice of the president 14% 4% -10\n\nRespondents were asked: How many of the following do you think are involved in corruption, or haven’t you heard enough about them to say?

The second-greatest gain is for the PCCB, where perceptions of corruption declined by 18 points, to 11%, in 2017. Only 4% of respondents now say “most” or “all” officials in the Presidency are corrupt, a decline of 10 points.\n\nNotably, the proportion of respondents who say they “don’t know” how many people are involved in corruption doubled or more across the board between 2014 and 2017, ranging up to 33% of all responses with regard to the PCCB.\n\nDespite improvements, significant proportions of Tanzanians still see corruption in their public institutions. More than one in three (36%) say most/all police officials are corrupt, while one in five (21%) say the same about judges and magistrates. Moreover, a majority of respondents see at least “some” officials as corrupt in all of these institutions except the president’s office (where 37% see at least “some” corruption).\n\nTrust in key public institutions\n\nDespite a decline in perceptions of corruption, the 2017 survey found no corresponding increase in levels of popular trust in key public institutions (Table 2). Only members of Parliament enjoyed a slight increase (4 percentage points) in the proportion of citizens who say they trust them “somewhat” or “a lot” (Table 2).\n\nOverall, Tanzanians express relatively high levels of trust in key public institutions, led by Parliament (76% say they trust representatives “somewhat” or “a lot”) and the president (73%). Curiously, the anti-corruption bureau and the revenue authority, which enjoyed strong reductions in perceived corruption, suffered 12-percentage-point declines in popular trust between 2014 and 2017.\n\nTable 2: Changes in popular trust in government institutions | Tanzania | 2014-2017\n\nTrust somewhat/a lot Change 2014-2017 (percentage points) 2014 2017\n\nParliament 72% 76% +4\n\nPolice 61% 62% +1\n\nCourts of law 69% 66% -3\n\nOffice of the president 80% 73% -7\n\nLocal government council 72% 64% -8\n\nTanzania Revenue Authority 60% 48% -12\n\nPrevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) 58% 46% -12\n\nRespondents were asked: How much do you trust each of the following, or haven’t you heard enough about them to say? (% who say “somewhat” or “a lot”)\n\nBut corruption persists among Tanzanians\n\nDespite reported improvements in institutional corruption, Tanzanians continue to encounter corrupt practices in key facets of their lives. Among respondents who dealt with the police during the year preceding the survey, more than one in three (36%) say they had to pay a\n\nCopyright ©Afrobarometer 2017 6\n\nbribe or offer a gift or favour to avoid problems at checkpoint or traffic stop or during an investigation. One in four (23%) say they paid a bribe to get help from the police, and one in five (20%) say they bribed a government official in order to obtain a needed document or permit. Smaller proportions acknowledge paying bribes to obtain care in a public clinic or hospital; to obtain water, sanitation, or electricity services; or to get help in a public school (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4: Frequency of paying bribes to obtain public services | Tanzania | 2017\n\nRespondents who had dealt with certain state agencies during the previous year were asked: And how often, if ever, did you have to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favour for: A teacher or school official in order to get the services you needed from the schools? A health worker or clinic or hospital staff in order to get the medical care you needed? A government official in order to get the document you needed? A government official in order to get the (water, sanitation, or electricity) services you needed? A police officer to get the assistance you needed? A police officer in order to avoid a problem [like at checkpoints, during identity checks or traffic stops, or during an investigation]? Wealthy people are far more likely than ordinary citizens to use corruption to achieve certain ends, according to survey respondents. At least six in 10 respondents think rich people are “somewhat likely” or “very likely” to be able to pay a bribe or use personal connections to avoid paying taxes (63%), avoid going to court (60%), or register land that doesn’t belong to them (66%). By contrast, only two in 10 think ordinary people could do the same (Figure 5).\n\n2%\n\n2%\n\n5%\n\n11%\n\n12%\n\n14%\n\n3%\n\n6%\n\n6%\n\n9%\n\n11%\n\n22%\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%\n\nPublic school\n\nWater, sanitation, or electricity\n\nPublic clinic or hospital\n\nDocument or permit\n\nPolice assistance\n\nAvoid problems with police\n\nOnce or twice A few times/Often\n\nCopyright ©Afrobarometer 2017 7\n\nFigure 5: Likelihood of using corruption to avoid taxes or court or to register land | rich vs. ordinary people | Tanzania | 2017\n\nRespondents were asked: In this country, how likely do you think it is that [a rich person/an ordinary person] could pay a bribe or use personal connections to get away with: Avoiding paying taxes they owe to government? Avoiding going to court? Registering land that does not belong to them? (% who say “somewhat likely” or “very likely”)\n\nFear undermines citizens’ role in fighting corruption\n\nThe fight against corruption is undermined by fear that reporting a bribery incident will lead to retaliation. More than seven in 10 respondents (72%) think that ordinary people face negative consequences if they report corruption to the authorities (Figure 6). Only one in five (22%) say people can feel safe when reporting corruption.\n\nFigure 6: Can citizens report corruption without fear? | Tanzania | 2017\n\nRespondents were asked: In this country, can ordinary people report incidents of corruption without fear, or do they risk retaliation or other negative consequences if they speak out?\n\n7%\n\n44%\n\n7%\n\n43%\n\n8%\n\n51%\n\n12%\n\n19%\n\n12%\n\n17%\n\n12%\n\n15%\n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n80%\n\n100%\n\nOrdinary\n\nperson\n\nRich person Ordinary\n\nperson\n\nRich person Ordinary\n\nperson\n\nRich person\n\nAvoid taxes Avoid going to court Register land that's not\n\ntheirs\n\nVery likely Somewhat likely\n\n22%\n\n71%\n\n6%\n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n80%\n\n100%\n\nCan report without fear Risk retaliation Don’t know\n\nCopyright ©Afrobarometer 2017 8\n\nIn line with high levels of fear of repercussions, Tanzanians have relatively little faith in their own ability to influence the fight against corruption and to get local authorities to act against corruption.\n\nOnly half (50%) of all respondents think that ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption in Tanzania, a decrease of 5 percentage points from 2014 (Figure 7).\n\nAnd fewer than half (45%) say local authorities are likely to take action if citizens report corrupt behaviour, such as misuse of funds or requests for bribes by government officials, police, or school or clinic staff (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 7: Can ordinary citizens make a difference in the fight against corruption? | Tanzania | 2014-2017\n\nRespondents were asked: Please tell me whether you agree or disagree with the following statement: Ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption?\n\nRespondents were asked: How likely is it that you could get someone to take action if you went to the local government council to report corrupt behaviour like misuse of funds or requests for bribes by government officers, police, or school or clinic staff, or haven’t you heard enough to say?\n\n55%\n\n33%\n\n12%\n\n50%\n\n44%\n\n6%\n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\nAgree/Strongly agree that\n\nordinary people can\n\nmake a difference\n\nDisagree/Strongly\n\ndisagree\n\nNeither agree nor disagree/Don't know\n\n2014 2017\n\n45%\n\n17%\n\n38%\n\nSomewhat/Very likely\n\nNot very/Not at all likely\n\nDon’t know\n\nCopyright ©Afrobarometer 2017 9\n\nConclusion\n\nIntensified anti-corruption efforts in Tanzania have led to a remarkable turnaround in the public’s view of the conduct of key institutions. In general, citizens report less corruption in their lives and within key public institutions than just three years ago, and there is widespread approval of the government’s fight against corruption.\n\nYet corruption is still seen as pervasive, especially among the police and judiciary, pointing to a need to review the effectiveness and sustainability of current anti-corruption strategies and measures. Survey results suggest that concerted efforts are needed to enhance public participation in the fight against corruption and overcome widespread apprehension about reprisals. The literature suggests that one way this could be done is by creating public spaces for citizen involvement in anti-corruption efforts (Bauhr, 2017; Sundell, 2016). Building on the annual gathering of stakeholders known as the National Anti-Corruption Forum (United Republic of Tanzania, 2017) and national opinion surveys such as Afrobarometer, Twaweza’s monthly Sauti za Wananchi mobile-phone polls, and the PCCB’s Governance and Corruption Survey, the authorities could identify platforms for developing and publicizing confidencebuilding measures such as awareness campaigns about the negative consequences of corruption, demonstrations of official impartiality in corruption cases, and guarantees of anonymity for whistle-blowers. The review of anti-corruption efforts also needs to focus on how to restore public faith in the very institutions tasked with waging the war against corruption.\n\nCopyright ©Afrobarometer 2017 10\n\nReferences\n\nBauhr, M.

    "full_text": "Spheres of trust: An empirical analysis of the foundations of particularised and generalised trustejpr_849 782..803\n\nMARKUS FREITAG & RICHARD TRAUNMÜLLER\n\nDepartment of Politics and Management, University of Konstanz, Germany\n\nAbstract. While the literature on trust has produced various conceptual models, there is also some confusion concerning different types of trust and their formation. In this article, three contested points are empirically clariﬁed. First, are there really different forms of trust as much of the literature suggests? Second, if so, then how are these different types of trust related to each other? Third, what are the foundations of these different forms of trust? Relying on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, it is concluded that two types of trust can be empirically identiﬁed: an intimate trust in people close to the truster, as well as an abstract trust in people in general. Although these types of trust constitute separate dimensions, they are positively related to each other. Furthermore, this article challenges the widely held assumption that experiences are most relevant for particularised trust, while generalised trust is based on psychological predispositions. It is argued instead for a spherespeciﬁc logic of trust formation: It is the radius of experiences and predispositions that matters for the radius of trust. Finally, the analysis goes beyond the existing research by highlighting hitherto unknown conditions under which trust in familiar domains is more or less likely to extend to generalised trust.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNiklas Luhmann (1979: 1) bemoaned a ‘sparse literature . . . that focuses on the subject of trust’. In the meantime, however, the scientiﬁc preoccupation with trust has become a ﬂourishing contemporary industry of research (Levi 2001).Although important discussions on the topic date back to philosophical forerunners of modern social science such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, as well as Georg Simmel’s more recent conception of trust ‘as one of the most important synthetic forces within society’ (Simmel 1992: 393–394), the current debate on trust is a rather recent phenomenon in the social sciences. This newfound interest in trust comes primarily from social capital research, where trust plays a key role in enabling cooperation between people (Coleman 1990; Freitag 2006; Fukuyama 1995; Glaeser et al. 1999; Newton 1999a; Putnam 1993, 1995a, 1995b; Uslaner 2002). Generally speaking, trust can be described as the expectation that others will contribute to the well-being of a person or a group, or at least will refrain\n\n782 European Journal of Political Research 48: 782–803, 2009 doi: 10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research) Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford, OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148, USA\n\nfrom harmful actions (Offe 1999). Beyond this minimal consensus, the vast literature on trust encompasses numerous conceptual variations, differentiations and typologies (e.g., Hardin 2002; Lane 1998; Levi 2001; Stolle 2002; Uslaner 2002; Yamagishi & Yamagishi 1994; Zucker 1986). While this multitude of proposed trust models has produced a lively debate, much confusion over the different types of trust and their respective foundations remains (Misztal 1996; Stolle 2002). A review of the literature, however, reveals that large parts of the ongoing controversies are purely theoretical.1 The empirical component has been neglected, due mainly to a lack of adequate data addressing various aspects of different forms of trust. In the present article, we aim to bridge this research gap by empirically evaluating some of the controversies. Relying on data from the German SocioEconomic Panel (SOEP), we investigate three key questions currently debated in trust research. First, is trust a single entity or a multidimensional concept – that is, can different types of trust be distinguished empirically? Second, should this be the case, what is the relationship between these different forms of trust? Are different types of trust correlated or are they largely independent of one another? Third, if different forms of trust can be detected, how are they formed? Are different forms of trust also based on different foundations? We restrict our analyses to the case of Germany. In addition to readily available data covering a wide range of different trust items, Germany in itself is an interesting case for trust research. In contrast to the United States, where levels of trust have been declining over the past decades (Putnam 1995a, 1995b; Uslaner 2002), Germany has experienced a constant increase in levels of trust since the 1950s (Newton 1999b). Furthermore, over the course of the reuniﬁcation process of East and West Germany during the last two decades, two distinct trust cultures rooted in different historical experiences have been merged together to form a new whole. However, save for a few comparative studies including Germany (e.g., Delhey & Newton 2005; Newton 1999b; Whiteley 1999), surprisingly little attention has been placed on investigating trust in Germany (Freitag & Traunmüller 2008; Kunz 2004). For this reason, and in addition to the above-mentioned theoretical concerns, taking a closer look at Germany’s trust culture will serve as an initial step in closing yet another research gap. The remainder of this article is organised into a series of steps. First, the conceptual debate concerning the differences between particularised and generalised trust, as well as their interrelation, is reviewed. After describing the data used in the analyses, we then will empirically investigate these assumptions. In the step to follow, we return to the theory, focusing on the different foundations of trust that have been proposed in the relevant literature. The\n\nspheres of trust 783\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025].

Finally, ﬁndings will be summarised and discussed in the conclusion.\n\nTrust: A multidimensional phenomenon or a single entity?\n\nWhereas trust seems to be a straightforward concept in everyday language and many researchers employ an untroubled usage of the term, others maintain that trust inherently implies something more complex and that different forms need to be distinguished conceptually. Newton (2001: 7), for instance, argues that ‘it makes little sense to use trust as a generic analytical concept, for there seems to be no such thing. We must stop talking about trust as if it were a single, indivisible entity’. Uslaner (2002) also stresses the importance of disaggregating trust into different types. Within the realm of interpersonal trust, the literature primarily identiﬁes two distinct kinds of trust with regard to their social scope: particularised trust and generalised trust (see Stolle 2002; Uslaner 2002; Whiteley 1999; Yamagishi & Yamagishi 1994).2 Particularised trust is trust found in close social proximity and extended toward people the individual knows from everyday interactions (e.g., family members, friends, neighbours and co-workers). Generalised trust is a rather abstract attitude toward people in general, encompassing those beyond immediate familiarity, including strangers (people one randomly meets in the street, fellow citizens, foreigners, etc.). In a similar vein, Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994: 139ff) distinguish knowledge-based trust as trust ‘in closely related people’ from general trust as trust‘in people in general’.According to Putnam (2000: 465), thick trust refers to trust within a small radius, extended only to those close to the truster; thin trust refers to trust with a large radius, extended to people who are more socially distant from the truster. However, if there are multiple dimensions of trust, then particularised and generalised trust should empirically, as well as analytically, be distinct from one another (Uslaner 2002: 51). In this regard, by means of factor analysis using survey data from the United States, Uslaner (2002: 54) reveals two distinct factors for particularised and generalised trust. Furthermore, testing a total of 32 items related to trust in different groups of people, Yamagishi & Yamagishi (1994: 144), conclude ‘that trust in general others and trust in closely related others did not load on the same factor’. Both ﬁndings, however, are contradicted by the results reported by Whiteley (2000), which indicate that trust in the family, fellow national citizens and the generalised other in fact form a single scale and could therefore be regarded as a coherent trust syndrome. Additionally, it is sometimes assumed that particularised trust and generalised trust are in fact zero-sum entities that cannot go together in the sense that\n\n784 markus freitag & richard traunmüller\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025].

According to Bahry et al. (2005: 522), however, ‘[i]n-group trust need not be an impediment to conﬁdence in out-groups or others generally. . . . Some people may trust only their own and distrust outsiders, but others may well trust both.’ Glanville and Paxton (2007: 240) also do not ﬁnd that ‘strong trust in any one domain hinders the establishment of more generalized trust’. Whereas according to their view, one would expect generalised trust and particularised trust to be positively correlated, Newton (2001: 6) argues that ‘one can predict virtually nothing about a person’s . . . trust in people from their trust in the family. Different forms of trust do not form a single syndrome; they are largely independent of each other, and they seem to be context speciﬁc.’ How does one then empirically depict the relationship between particularised and generalised trust? In order to ﬁnd an answer to this question we draw on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey project.3 Here, respondents were asked how much trust they place in their own family, friends, neighbours and co-workers, as well as in strangers they meet for the ﬁrst time. Possible answers ranged from (1) ‘no trust at all’ to (4) ‘a lot of trust’.A slightly altered version of the standard trust item was also included in the questionnaire. On a scale from one to four, respondents could indicate the extent to which they agreed with the statement ‘In general people can be trusted’. Additionally, and employing the same scale, the level of agreement with the statement ‘When dealing with strangers, it is better to be careful, before trusting them’ was asked. Table 1 shows the rotated factor structure obtained from a maximum likelihood factor analysis.4 Because the indicator variables’ scale is ordinal, the factor analysis is based on a polychoric correlation matrix.5 Moreover, as theoretical assumptions suggest that different kinds of trust may in fact be correlated, an oblique rotation using the Promax criterion was conducted, explicitly taking this possibility into account, rather than precluding it a priori by means of orthogonal rotation.6\n\nOur results suggest that the pattern of the trust items is best described by assuming two underlying factors. As expected, the two factors represent particularised trust and generalised trust. Items loading high on the ﬁrst factor all refer to people known to the respondents from daily interactions.The variable with the highest loading (0.651) is trust in neighbours, followed by trust in friends (0.603). The item on trust in one’s own family belongs to the same dimension (0.602). All in all, this factor clearly represents close-range social (i.e., particularized) trust. In contrast, the item showing the highest loading on the second factor is trust in strangers one meets for the ﬁrst time (0.715).

Finally, the standard trust item ‘In general people can be trusted’ also loads on the second dimension (0.455), indicating that – contrary to frequent criticism – it does indeed encompass trust in strangers (i.e., generalised trust). Against this background, the proposed distinction between particularised trust and generalised trust is not only theoretical in nature;it can also be shown empirically. Respondents clearly differentiate generalised trust – an abstract trust attitude that is directed toward people in general, including strangers – from particularised trust toward familiar people in their immediate social environment. Since the different historical experiences of East and West Germany could have led to distinct trust cultures in these two parts of the country, we separately conducted factor analyses for each of them (not shown here). The factor structures obtained were similar to the one found for the entire sample, showing that East and West Germans do not differ in their classiﬁcation of trust in closely related people and trust in strangers. How do these two distinct kinds of trust relate to each other? The correlation of the estimated factor scores is r = 0.51 (p < 0.001).This value indicates a considerable positive relationship between the two forms of trust.According to our results, there does not seem to be a simple trade-off between trusting closely related people and trusting those who are unknown; our results rather\n\nTable 1.

Although research on the formation of trust is still in its nascent stages (e.g., Alesina & La Ferrara 2002; Bjørnskov 2007; Delhey & Newton 2005; Freitag 2003; Freitag & Bühlmann forthcoming; Glaeser et al. 1999; Glanville & Paxton 2007; Hooghe & Stolle 2003; Li et al. 2008; Paxton 2007; Uslaner 2002; Welch et al. 2007), there are, nevertheless, two general theoretical perspectives on how trust is formed (Glanville & Paxton 2007).The ﬁrst stresses that a person’s trust is basically an evaluation of his or her social environment and therefore grounded in concrete experiences of trustworthiness in social interaction. In the second perspective, trust is a general propensity either innate or learned early in life and is thus primarily a personal predisposition. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that each of these two different foundations correspond to different forms of trust. Whereas particularised trust in people one knows well is said to be based on concrete experiences from past social interactions, generalised trust in unknown people is presumed to rest on the personal predispositions of the truster. In other words, a clear-cut assignment of certain foundations to certain contexts of trust is proposed, thereby giving rise to two distinct explanatory models of trust (see Uslaner 2000, 2002; Yamagishi & Yamagishi 1994). Exponents of the ﬁrst perspective, who are mostly anchored in rational choice theory, argue that trust is mainly grounded in a rational evaluation of the trustworthiness of others (Coleman 1990; Hardin 2002). In order to judge another actor’s trustworthiness, information on that actor is needed – usually in terms of his or her reputation, past behaviour in similar situations or the actor’s given incentive structure (see Coleman 1990; Dasgupta 1988; Gambetta 1988). In other words, this evaluation is based on concrete experience from repeated interaction and therefore on an already existing relationship. Drawing on past experiences, the other actor’s probable future behaviour can be inferred. An ongoing relationship also provides an informational basis for the other actor’s incentive structure, who generally will be interested in the continuation of the relationship and will therefore behave in a trustworthy manner (Cook & Hardin 2001; Hardin 2002).Additionally, any two actors and potential cooperators will usually be embedded in wider social networks with other actors. This structural context gives rise to reputational effects, as breaches of trust are easily communicated among actors within the network and sanctions may be effectively imposed (Coleman 1990; Cook & Hardin\n\nspheres of trust 787\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n2001). In this way, trustworthy behaviour is maintained and, consequently, trust in others encouraged. This explanation of how trust is formed clearly applies primarily to trust in the immediate social environment (i.e., particularised trust in family, friends and other people already known through everyday interactions and sharing common social contacts). How are we then to estimate the trustworthiness of strangers (i.e., people we meet for the ﬁrst time and with whom we have no prior ﬁrst- or second-hand experiences to guide our judgment)? According to the rational choice approach, placing trust in unknown people simply does not make any sense. However, as we have shown, people do in fact distinguish between trust in people with whom they are well-acquainted and trust in unfamiliar people in general. How people come to develop this latter, more abstract, kind of trust will be discussed below. The second, psychological, perspective suggests that trust is not exclusively dependent on the qualities of the trusted person (i.e., his or her estimated trustworthiness), but rather depends largely on the trustfulness of the truster (Sztompka 1998: 20). According to Uslaner (1999: 138), for example, trust in strangers cannot be based on evidence and therefore must rest on a different foundation – a moral predisposition to trust that ‘is a world view, not a summation of life experiences’. Trust is therefore a stable personality trait that does not change over time and is closely related to other psychological predispositions, such as optimism for the future and a sense of control over one’s life. People who have an optimistic view of the world will also anticipate social interactions with unknown persons in a conﬁdent and positive way. Even if their trust is breached, this negative experience does not alter their general positive outlook, nor does it prevent them from trusting again in another situation. A similar trust model was presented by Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994: 136). They view trust as a cognitive bias in the processing of imperfect information on another person’s intentions (see also Yamagishi 2001). In other words, people with a trusting personality habitually tend to overestimate the benignity of other persons beyond the level that the available information in a given situation would actually warrant.This psychological mechanism leads to the propensity to risk placing trust in people with whom they have no prior acquaintance – that is, to generalised trust. However, beyond these two explanatory models derived from a welldeﬁned combination of foundations and objects of trust, large parts of the social capital literature obscure this otherwise straightforward differentiation. Putnam (2000), for instance, builds on the theoretical insights of the rational choice approach on trust formation; however, he deviates from the original argument and applies the perspective to generalised trust, stressing that trust\n\n788 markus freitag & richard traunmüller\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nin strangers essentially also rests on experience. More speciﬁcally, experiences within social networks of civic engagement are said to be conducive to this abstract attitude of trust (see also Brehm & Rahn 1997). Crucial is the assumption that trust based on positive experiences made in one domain (e.g., in an association) will eventually spill over to other domains of social life and therefore will be extended to people in general.The exact mechanism thought to be at work here, however, remains to be fully understood (Stolle 2003: 23). Furthermore, this connection is also far from being empirically conﬁrmed (see Claibourn & Martin 2000; Freitag 2003; Hooghe & Stolle 2003; Uslaner 2002). In reaction to the shortcomings of this society-centred account of trust formation, other social capital theorists have instead turned to political institutions as important sources of generalised trust (Cusack 1999; Freitag & Bühlmann forthcoming; Herreros & Criado 2008; Kumlin & Rothstein 2005; Rothstein & Stolle 2003). In this regard, institutions can stimulate individual attitudes and trustworthy behaviour through different incentives. If citizens feel that they are not treated fairly by the authorities and politicians, their self-esteem will be negatively inﬂuenced, thereby shaping how they behave toward strangers or unknown people. If the ofﬁcials of the government or the public administration are not fair and trustworthy, why should the rest of society be (Rothstein & Stolle 2003)? On the other hand, institutional arrangements produce particular habits and norms of trustworthiness, such as intolerance of corruption, cheating or the exploitation by majorities as unacceptable behaviour, thus making people inherently trustworthy through socialisation mechanisms.Both mechanisms presume that experiences of trustworthiness are relevant for generalised trust. Indeed, an overly rigid and impermeable conception of the general foundation for an individual form of trust (i.e., experiences for particularised trust and predispositions for generalised trust) is clearly too narrow. While one certainly cannot personally know a majority of one’s fellow citizens, who therefore remain strangers, there is no doubt that prior ﬁrst- or second-hand experiences with strangers will inﬂuence one’s current expectations of them.In his ‘street-epistemology of trust’, Hardin (2002: 113), for instance, argues that the judgement of whether or not to trust a stranger is made ‘largely by generalization from past encounters with other people’. In this sense, experiences would not only structure particularised trust, but also inﬂuence the generalised form. Furthermore, with regard to one’s predispositions, it is conceivable that these are also directed toward one’s immediate surroundings and do not refer only to wider spheres of social life. Trust in closely related people will have a dispositional or emotional base as well and will not rest solely upon rational evaluations of their respective incentive structures. Therefore, rather than\n\nspheres of trust 789\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025].

In our view, experiences and personal predispositions are both central to the formation of trust; however, the inﬂuence of given experiences and personal predispositions appears to depend on the speciﬁc sphere or domain to which they refer. In fact, our argument is compellingly simple: there is a spectrum of concreteness from intimate to generalised trust, whose respective experiences and psychological predispositions differ. From one perspective, experiences and predispositions that correspond to a familiar and clearly deﬁned environment are relevant for the formation of particularised trust (see Figure 1). Experiences from regular interactions with acquaintances through informal channels or networks of civic engagement are therefore pivotal for particularised trust. Furthermore, relying on the views of the social capital school, one’s assessment of local political institutions and actors (such as the police, local public authorities and administration) that regulate the narrow sphere of everyday life will inﬂuence the propensity to place trust within this very domain. It will be rather difﬁcult to trust neighbours, acquaintances and friends if local authorities signal that it is acceptable to cheat or bribe and if the police do not intervene and sanction harmful actions within one’s immediate social surroundings. Additionally, predispositions that are primarily targeted at familiar spheres of social life and refer to feelings of security and control over the nearby space should be associated with trust in people close to the truster.\n\nParticularised Trust Generalised Trust\n\nExperiences\n\n– Experiences from regular interactions with known people\n\n– Evaluation of local institutions\n\n– First- and second-hand experiences with strangers\n\n– Evaluation of national and supranational institutions\n\nDispositions – Predispositions referring to personal and familiar contexts (e.g., sense of security and control)\n\n–Mechanisms for coping with uncertainty in the wider community (e.g., risk propensity, general optimism)\n\nFigure 1.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nFrom another perspective, experiences and predispositions ranging beyond the everyday sphere as well as extending past the borders of a well-deﬁned personal environment generate generalised trust. Experiences outside one’s narrow circle of everyday interactions, such as contact with unknown people and the evaluation of the more distant representative political institutions (national and supranational parliament, justice or government, etc.), have an impact on generalised trust. The same should hold true for predispositions as well. Psychological predispositions relevant for coping with situations outside the immediate realm of control and familiarity should accompany generalised trust. In sum, experiences and predispositions remain important foundations of the formation of trust; this formation, however, very much depends on the particular contexts to which these experiences and predispositions refer. This basic argument of the sphere-speciﬁc logic of trust formation renders earlier ways of thinking more precise, as well as overcoming their previous analytical deﬁcits. Consequently, this conceptual foundation is able to produce a more appropriate model to explain the formation of particularised and generalised trust.\n\nMethod, data and operationalisation\n\nIn our empirical investigation, we ﬁrst estimated two identical OLS regression models using the respective factor scores for particularised trust and generalised trust as dependent variables (see models 1 and 3 in Table 2). In order to test the proposed context-speciﬁc foundations of trust, we included several independent variables regarding social interaction experiences, as well as psychological predispositions belonging to different spheres of social life.7\n\nTo cover experiences within the respondents’ immediate social surroundings, informal social connections were operationalised as a factor score, consisting of an item asking how often respondents meet socially with relatives, friends and neighbours and an item asking how often they help their relatives, friends and neighbours. Higher scores implied more frequent informal contacts. For networks of civic and associational engagement that also belong to the immediate sphere of regular interactions, a weighted scale including two items asking how frequently respondents volunteer in associations, organisations or social services and how frequently they participate in citizens’ initiatives and local affairs as well as the number of memberships in various groups was constructed via factor analysis. Again, higher scores indicated stronger civic and associational engagement. As proxies for experiences with local institutions that people deal with on an everyday basis, conﬁdence in the police\n\nspheres of trust 791\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025].

As an evaluation of a somewhat distant political institution, a measure of conﬁdence in the parliament (ranging from (1) ‘no trust at all’ to (4) ‘a lot of trust’) was considered. Psychological predispositions that refer to domains beyond the immediate setting were included, inquiring about general optimism for the future, as well as the propensity to take risks. To measure the ﬁrst, an item stating ‘When thinking of the future, I am actually quite conﬁdent’ was included. Respondents could agree or disagree on a scale ranging from one to four, with higher values denoting greater agreement. The question gauging risk propensity asked the respondent whether he or she considered himself or herself as someone who is willing to take risks or rather as someone who is risk averse. Answers ranged from one to ten, where higher values indicated a greater propensity to take risks. Several relevant control variables discussed in the literature that may have an impact on trust also entered the equations. Age and education consistently have been shown to be decisive factors for generalised trust. Older people and those with a higher level of education generally exhibit greater trust toward their fellow citizens (see Delhey & Newton 2005; Freitag 2003; Putnam 2000; Uslaner 2002). For this reason, we included both, measuring age in years and level of education using the CASMIN classiﬁcation (König et al. 1988). In addition to respondents’ sex, dummies for current unemployment, living in a large city and foreign citizenship also entered the equations. Following the literature, the latter three factors were all expected to lead to a decrease in generalised trust (see Putnam 2000; Sztompka 1999; Uslaner 2002). Finally, an important attribute in the German case, whether the respondent resided in East or West Germany prior to 1989, was also considered. Not only did the experience of communism in the former GDR stimulate distrust in the political elite, but also among the citizens themselves (see Mishler & Rose 1997; Rose 1994; Sztompka 1995). In addition to political oppression and a dysfunctional economy, the institution of the Stasi, with its endemic spying activities, caused people to become particularly suspicious of each other. Since uniﬁcation, these experiences have been relegated to the history books, but it is quite plausible that their imprint on the former East German consciousness has resulted in lingering low levels of generalised trust.\n\nEmpirical ﬁndings\n\nWith regard to models 1 and 3 in Table 2, it becomes clear that while particularised and generalised trust share some foundations, they also vary in several\n\nspheres of trust 793\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025].

Let us ﬁrst turn to the dispositional foundations of trust. As expected from our sphere-speciﬁc logic of trust formation, a ﬁrm sense of control over one’s life plays an important role for trusting the people whom one encounters on a regular basis, but has no inﬂuence on trusting people in general.This is an interesting result as it differs from the argument put forward by Uslaner (2002), who holds that people who feel in control of their life situation should also more readily place trust in strangers. It is, however, conceivable that a feeling of control would primarily be linked to matters concerning one’s immediate social surrounding. A marked risk propensity is not relevant for trust in well-known people; however, risk propensity does matter in situations beyond every day familiarity – for example, in situations where the person to be trusted is an anonymous stranger. A somewhat different pattern emerges regarding one’s optimism for the future, which is signiﬁcantly associated with both types of trust. Respondents with a generally optimistic attitude tend to trust the people in their immediate social environment and also place more faith in their fellow citizens, including strangers. With regard to the impact of experiences in social interactions, involvement in formal networks of civic engagement led to an increase of particularised trust, as did informal socialising with friends, neighbours and relatives. This is what one would expect from a rational trust point of view (see also Herreros 2004; Herreros & Criado 2003).These forms of social interaction, however, had no impact on generalised trust in strangers, as social capital theorists tend to assume. Concrete experiences with strangers seem rather to be relevant for trust in personally unknown individuals. People who reported that they had previously beneﬁted from the generosity of people unknown to them scored higher on generalised trust. However, a positive experience with a stranger did not cause people to place more trust in the people dealt with on a daily basis. The experiential foundations of trust therefore seem to be highly context or domain speciﬁc. A more or less similar pattern emerged regarding the impact of political institutions on trust. Positive evaluations of ‘street-level bureaucrats’ (Rothstein & Stolle 2003) (i.e., representatives of institutions that people interact with on an everyday basis, such as the police) led to trust in one’s immediate social surrounding, but not necessarily to an abstract attitude like generalised social trust. In contrast, conﬁdence in parliament – an institution that is not only far beyond most people’s daily experiences, but also in the truest sense of the word represents fellow citizens in general – promotes generalised trust. Finally, as anticipated, the rather imprecise localisation of public authorities inﬂuenced both particularised and generalised trust. Looking at the control variables, some exhibited the same effects for both types of trust, while others had an impact only on particularised trust.

Higher education also led to more trust in immediate social surroundings as well as to more abstract trust targeted at people in general. What has been shown to hold true for generalised trust in previous empirical research (e.g., Freitag 2003; Uslaner 2002) may therefore be transferred to particularised trust as well. Being unemployed, on the other hand, had negative effects on trust only in the immediate social environment. Concerning generalised trust, the negative effect of unemployment – although quite substantial – is not signiﬁcant; however, it is conceivable that this variable’s coefﬁcient would turn signiﬁcant in a larger sample. With regard to the comparison of eastern and western Germans, whatever differences in generalised trust that might have existed prior to 1989, or shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, are no longer visible today (cf. Kunz 2004; Rainer & Siedler 2006). Additional analyses (not presented here) show that the insigniﬁcance of the East dummy cannot be attributed to other highly collinear variables in the model that confound the effect of socialist heritage; rather, with regard to generalised trust, convergence has occurred between East and West Germany in the period since reuniﬁcation – a process that can also be observed for other cultural aspects. However, eastern Germans displayed greater particularised trust than their western countrymen. Neither form of trust was inﬂuenced by the sex of the respondent, foreign citizenship or whether or not the respondent resides in a large city.All of the coefﬁcients failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance at p \u0002 0.1.9\n\nIn general, it can be concluded that experience and predispositions are relevant for both kinds of trust: trust in closely related people and trust in strangers. However, there is no clear-cut assignment of one general foundation to a speciﬁc sphere of trust, as parts of the literature suggest. Both trust in people well-known and trust in people unknown rest on a dispositional basis and are also shaped by ﬁrst- and second-hand experiences and evaluations.The process of trust formation seems rather to follow an entirely different logic: a sphere-speciﬁc logic. As expected, some experiences and predispositions matter particularly for particularised trust and others for generalised trust. To be more speciﬁc, psychological predispositions relating to people’s personal environments are relevant for trust within exactly this social sphere, whereas predispositions that enable people to transcend familiar situations and are directed toward wider-ranged communities lead to the more extensive form of generalised trust. Nevertheless, as we have already shown in a simple correlation analysis, there seems to be some evidence that people who exhibit higher levels of trust toward those closely related to themselves also place greater faith in the general other. In order to prove this assumption against the background of our ﬁndings to date, we took a closer look at this crucial, but at the same time little\n\nspheres of trust 795\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025].

To do so, we followed Uslaner (2002: 145) and turned to simultaneous equation modeling. This allows us to treat both particularised and generalised trust as endogenous variables at the same time and to test their causal relationship. Using the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression method, we estimated two more equations: one for the impact of particularised trust on generalised trust (model 4 in Table 2) and one to examine the reverse (model 2 in Table 2).As particularised trust and generalised trust were jointly determined, they were regarded as endogenous variables in the system. As exogenous variables, only those variables that proved signiﬁcant for one type of trust in the preceding regression models were included in the respective equation.10\n\nResults in Table 2 clarify the relationship between trust in closely related people and trust in people in general in a more meaningful way than the previous simple correlation was able to do. While generalised trust had no impact on particularised trust, trust in well-known people has a signiﬁcant effect on trust in strangers. In other words, the arrow runs from particularised trust to generalised trust, but not the reverse. Contradicting the ﬁndings reported by Uslaner (2002: 147) for the United States, particularised trust does indeed seem to spill over to generalised trust in Germany. The remaining effects were more or less identical to those found in the previous models.11\n\nLooking at the results as a whole, it has been shown that trust in closely related people and trust in strangers belong to distinct spheres and their corresponding sets of experiences and dispositions. Nevertheless, particularised trust seems to further trust that goes beyond the narrow circles of acquaintance and familiarity (see Erikson 1964; Glanville & Paxton 2007). Particularised trust, in this sense, may be a necessary foundation upon which generalised trust can be built; however, according to our argument, it should not be sufﬁcient. Therefore, in our last analytic step, we attempted to bridge these two opposed aspects by empirically identifying the conditions that reinforce or weaken the relationship between particularised and generalised trust and thus impact the spillover and expansion of trust. This was undertaken by considering several interaction effects and introducing them into the 2SLS regression equation for generalised trust.12\n\nFor the sake of clarity, Table 3 presents coefﬁcients and t-values of the interaction terms and constitutive variables only. Only two of them have a signiﬁcant moderating impact on the relationship between particularised and generalised trust. Positive experiences with a stranger, as well as a positive evaluation of the parliament, are key conditions that encourage the extension of trust from the narrow private sphere to the wider public.13 Most notably, results for the interaction of particularised trust and experience with strangers show that particularised trust will in fact not spill over to generalised trust\n\n796 markus freitag & richard traunmüller\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025].

The respective main effect is statistically insigniﬁcant. The experiential foundations of trust thus are highly sphere-speciﬁc.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe literature on trust has produced various conceptual models, but also some confusion concerning different types of trust and how they are formed (see Misztal 1996; Stolle 2002). In this article, we attempt to contribute to the lively debate on trust by empirically addressing some of the unanswered questions. Three important and contested points were tackled in our analysis. Are there really different forms of trust, as put forth by large parts of the literature? If so, how are these different types of trust related to each other? And ﬁnally, what are the foundations of these different forms of trust? Relying on representative survey data from Germany, we concluded that different forms of trust can indeed be empirically identiﬁed. More speciﬁcally,\n\nTable 3.

Moreover, these two types of trust were not at odds with each other, as is sometimes assumed in the theoretical literature (Banﬁeld 1958; Fukuyama 1995; Uslaner 2002). Quite to the contrary, people who placed high levels of trust in their immediate social surrounding also tended to place greater faith in people in general. Our analyses revealed that particularised trust is in fact a foundation upon which generalised trust can be built – given the right circumstances. According to our ﬁndings, no clear-cut correspondence of experiential and dispositional foundations to generalised and particularised trust was found.We opted instead for a more precise assignment of these foundations with regard to the speciﬁc spheres or domains to which they refer. In this sense, certain predispositions and experiences were relevant for certain types of trust, revealing a clear sphere-speciﬁc logic of trust formation. Experiences and predispositions belonging to the immediate social sphere were most relevant for particularised trust. Generalised trust, on the other hand, was based on experiences made beyond the realm of familiarity, as well as on psychological predispositions targeted at personally unknown domains and wide-ranged communities. Simply put, it is the radius of experiences and predispositions that matters for the radius of trust. Finally, our analysis goes beyond the existing and very recent research in highlighting hitherto unknown conditions under which trust in familiar domains is more or less likely to extend to generalised trust. We also went a step further by empirically identifying the very conditions that lead to a spillover of particularised trust to generalised trust. Generalised trust is not to be seen as a mere summation of particularistic worlds of trust, as argued by Glanville and Paxton (2007), but depends rather on speciﬁc vehicles transferring it to the realm beyond familiarity.According to our analyses, the extension of particularised trust to generalised trust is encouraged by positive contacts with strangers and trustworthy political institutions.With regard to the former, positive experiences with unknown people are indispensable for building generalised trust. The role of the latter is to guarantee these positive experiences by effectively and credibly sanctioning untrustworthy behaviour and breaches of trust. Moreover, representatives of institutions serve as important role models that should provide people with further examples of trustworthiness and signal that trustworthy behaviour is not only desirable, but pays off – thereby providing further encouragement (Kumlin & Rothstein 2005; Rothstein & Stolle 2003). While we have concentrated on the identiﬁcation, interrelation and foundations of two distinct forms of trust, the consequences of particularised and\n\n798 markus freitag & richard traunmüller\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025].

To the best of our knowledge, and to date, only the contributions of Gibson (2001), Herreros (2004), Uslaner (2002) and Welch et al. (2007) empirically scrutinise the formation of different types of trust. 2. Another crucial distinction involves interpersonal trust (e.g., trust in people), on the one hand, and institutional or political trust (e.g., trust in societal institutions and their representatives), on the other (see Newton 1999b; Offe 1999; Putnam 1995a, 1995b, 2000). In the present article, however, we concentrate solely on interpersonal trust; the focus of analysis is on trust attitudes people have toward each other. 3. The aim of this project is to provide information on objective life conditions as well as subjective values and orientations by means of a representative longitudinal study of private households in Germany. For our present analyses, however, we will not rely on data from the main survey, but rather on material taken from the 2006 stand-alone data set ‘Personality and Everyday Life’, allowing for in-depth research on topics not covered in regular waves of the SOEP. The data were collected by trained interviewers via computer assisted face-to-face interviews in summer 2005. The target population included all non-institutionalised residents of Germany 16 years of age and older. A multi-staged random sampling procedure yielded a total of N = 1,012 respondents. We would like to thank Jürgen Schupp (DIW) for kindly providing us with the data. 4. We chose to exclude the item for trust in co-workers from the factor analysis in order to retain a higher number of cases and so as not to bias the sample toward the employed. Including this item in the factor analysis did not alter the general factor structure. 5. For an alternative approach using item response theory (IRT), see Li et al. (2005). 6. Orthogonal rotation led to the same general factor structure, differing only slightly in item loadings. 7. A detailed description of all variables is available from the authors’ website (www.unikonstanz.de/freitag). Unfortunately, for the current dataset it is not possible to assign respondents to contextual units in order to check for contextual effects on the two types of trust, as suggested by a referee.\n\nspheres of trust 799\n\n© 2009 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2009 (European Consortium for Political Research)\n\n14756765, 2009, 6, Downloaded from https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00849.x by Cochrane Portugal, Wiley Online Library on [17/06/2025].

The question of conﬁdence in public authorities does not speciﬁcally refer to local institutions; we therefore expect a positive correlation with both forms of trust. 9. In the literature, it is still common to run separate analyses for eastern and western Germany (e.g., Kunz 2004; Zmerli et al. 2007; Zmerli 2008). Unfortunately, our eastern German sample does not include enough cases to allow for separate regression analysis in any sensible and meaningful way, retaining all explanatory variables in the model. Given this obvious limitation of our data, we refrain from presenting separate models. However, it should be noted that Kunz (2004: 224) ﬁnds that overall, individual determinants of generalised trust are indeed very similar in the populations of eastern and western Germany. 10. Whereas only some variables are always exogenous (sex, for example), most others can in fact be considered either endogenous or exogenous. The distinction between the endogenous and exogenous variables depends therefore to a large degree on how researchers deﬁne the scope of their research interest at hand (see Studenmund 1997: 532).Nonetheless,the F statistics in the ﬁrst-stage regressions as well as Sargan’s tests for over-identiﬁcation (not shown here) underscore the adequacy and exogeneity of the used instruments. It should also be noted that the reported results are not sensitive to the inclusion of the hitherto non-signiﬁcant variables. 11. One exception is optimism for the future, where no signiﬁcant effect on particularised trust could now be detected. However, this should not come as a surprise as it is actually a predisposition referring to a wider horizon, rather than to one’s immediate situation. 12. In order to avoid multicollinearity and to ease interpretation, all variables except for the dummies were centred. Interaction terms were included one at a time. 13. Additionally, calculating interaction terms for civic engagement and informal social contacts, respectively (not illustrated here), showed that social networks do not function as ampliﬁers of the relationship between particularised and generalised trust. This is an important result for social capital theory, where it is assumed that experiences made in one sphere (e.g., in civic associations) are actually transferred and generalised into wider spheres of social life (Hooghe & Stolle 2003; Putnam 1993).\n\nReferences\n\nAlesina, A. & La Ferrara, E.
