BRIDGE (FCT 2023.12063.PEX): 
 SCOPING LITERATURE REVIEW CODEBOOK 
 
Databases: SCOPUS, Google Scholar & APSA Preprints 
Timeframe: since 1950-2025(June)  
Questions the SLR aims to answer: How has the citizen–parliament relationship been 
conceptualized and measured in existing literature, and what dimensions beyond trust and 
satisfaction have been explored? 
Variable Name 
Values and Labels / Description 
Study_ID 
Unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to 
each study (e.g., SLR001). 
Coder_Initials 
Initials of the coder responsible for data 
extraction:  
 
AM= Ana Matias  
RO= Rui Oliveira 
Author_LastNames 
Last names of the authors as listed in the 
publication. 
Full_Citation 
Complete bibliographic citation 
Year_Publication 
Year when the publication was published 
(numeric). 
Type_Publication 
Type of publication:  
 
(Single selection) 
  
1 = Article  
2 = Report  
3 = Thesis  
4 = Book Chapter  
5 = Other 
Language 
Language in which the publication is 
written:

Type_Publication/Study 
(Single selection)  
 
1 = Empirical  
2 = Theoretical  
 
Note: Clarification: Empirical articles are 
those with clearly established data 
collection and data analysis procedures 
that aim at describing phenomena or/and 
testing hypotheses/explanations/ 

 
2
arguments. Empirical articles are those 
with clearly established data collection and 
data analysis procedures that aim to 
describe phenomena and/or test 
hypotheses, explanations, or arguments. 
This category also includes evidence 
syntheses such as meta-analyses and 
scoping reviews. (If in doubt, classify as 
empirical when the study systematically 
extracts or analyses data, even if 
secondary). Theoretical articles focus on 
concept definition and formation, and 
theory building and normally do not 
include empirical research. 
Type_Parliament 
Type of parliaments covered in the study  
 
(Single selection)  
 
1 = National  
2 = Sub-national  
3 = Both  
98 = Unclear 
Attitudes_MainFocus 
Does the study focus primarily on 
attitudes/perceptions/opinions towards 
parliament?  
 
(Single selection)  
 
1 = Yes  
2 = Partially  
3 = No  
98 = Unclear. 
Research_Questions1  
Research_Questions2… 
As stated by the authors.  
 
Note: Use 99='Not reported' if not present 
or 98= 'Unclear' if ambiguous or 97= Not 
applicable. 
Behavioral_Engagement1 
Behavioral_Engagement2… 
Forms of citizen behavior toward 
parliaments examined in the study? 
 
(Multiple selection)  
 
0 = None  
1 = Petitioning (signing/submitting 
petitions to parliament)  
2 = Contacting MPs (letters, emails, 
constituency visits)  
3 = Voting in parliamentary elections 
(when explicitly linked to parliamentary 
representation)  

 
3
4 = Participation in formal 
consultations/hearings (inquiries, public 
submissions)  
5 = Parliamentary visits/events (open days, 
tours, educational activities)  
6 = Social media engagement with 
parliament (following, liking, commenting, 
sharing)  
7 = Consumption of parliamentary 
information (watching debates, reading 
official sites/reports)  
8 = Protest/demonstration directed toward 
parliament  
9 = Other 
Attitudinal_Engagement1 
Attitudinal_Engagement2… 
Attitudes and evaluations of citizens 
toward parliaments examined in the study?  
(Multiple selection) 
0 = None 
1 = Trust/confidence in parliament  
2 = Satisfaction with parliament  
3 = Perceived legitimacy of parliament  
4 = Perceptions of responsiveness 
(parliament listening/acting on citizens’ 
concerns)  
5 = Perceptions of accessibility/usability 
(ease of understanding or interacting with 
parliament)  
6 = Identification/attachment to 
parliament (sense of belonging, 
representativeness)  
7 = Perceived transparency/openness of 
parliament  
8 = Other  
 
Note: Always code based on the 
operational measure (the variable 
measured), not the label the authors assign. 
If it says confidence in parliament, treat 
this as Trust, since “trust” and “confidence” 
are conceptually interchangeable in the 
literature (Norris, 2011). 
Conceptual_Definition1 
Conceptual_Definition2… 
If possible, extract definitions to explore 
how the main concepts are framed (in their 
own words).  

 
4
(all that apply are selected)  
Note: If authors are not clear about the 
definitions they use, code as 98. This may 
occur when authors present several 
conceptualizations in a state-of-the-art 
section without explicitly stating their own 
definition. 
Research_Design1 
Research_Design2… 
Applicable only for empirical studies (from 
this point onward).  
 
(Multiple choice, all that apply are selected) 
  
1 = Case-study (single case)  
2 = Comparative (two or more cases)  
3 = Experimental or quasi-experimental  
4 = Evidence synthesis (meta-analysis, 
scoping reviews) 
Time_Frame 
Time period analyzed. E.g., 2015–2020 or 
99='Not reported'.  
 
Note: It might be a point in time (e.g. 
“2008”), or a period (e.g. 2009-2020). 
  
When the time periods differ between 
descriptive and multivariate analyses, for 
instance, record the longest time frame. 
Country 
Country. If multiple countries, separate 
with semicolons.

analysis, ethnographic methods, 
interviews, qualitative synthesis)

Key_Findings 
Brief summary of main findings relevant to 
citizens' attitudes or views of parliaments

Any additional comments, coding 
difficulties, or points of clarification. 
 
Standard values/labels to use across all variables: 
To ensure inter-coder consistency, always use the following terms when applicable: 
99 = Not Reported – If the information is missing or not discussed. 
98 = Unclear – If the information is presented ambiguously. 
97= Not Applicable – If the variable does not apply to the specific study.
